                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:03,000<br>So in this video, we’ll talk about wireless networking.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:03,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,919<br>And wireless systems turn out to in practice be really different than wired ones.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:07,919 –&gt; 00:00:12,320<br>One of the big challenges to see today on the internet is we all want to connect wirelessly,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,320 –&gt; 00:00:15,839<br>yet there have been a lot of assumptions made, historically, that networks would behave</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:15,839 –&gt; 00:00:20,920<br>like wired ones, and actually bridging that to wireless is often difficult, which is why</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:20,920 –&gt; 00:00:24,480<br>we see poor performance, saying you’re laptop using Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:24,480 –&gt; 00:00:27,400<br>So in this video, I’m going to talk really about why is wireless different?</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:27,399 –&gt; 00:00:31,399<br>What are these properties that make it so challenging and so difficult, and why is it</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:31,399 –&gt; 00:00:33,119<br>sometimes seem to be flaky?</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:33,119 –&gt; 00:00:36,920<br>So in the context of this video, I’m going to focus on access point networks.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:36,920 –&gt; 00:00:44,879<br>And by that, I mean wireless networks where, you know, say you have your laptop with some</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:44,879 –&gt; 00:00:54,399<br>Wi-Fi card, and it connects to some access point, which then has a wired connection to the</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:54,399 –&gt; 00:00:59,159<br>internet.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:59,159 –&gt; 00:01:07,159<br>And this access point is serving, you know, it’s often multiple devices, like case your phone.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:07,159 –&gt; 00:01:12,480<br>This is different than, say, a mobile phone network, or you know, a 3G or 4G, which are</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,480 –&gt; 00:01:17,759<br>managed very differently, much more tightly controlled, all kinds of different issues emerging</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:17,759 –&gt; 00:01:18,759<br>those systems.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:18,760 –&gt; 00:01:24,520<br>Here I’m just going to focus on open standards, access point networks, you know, things</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:24,520 –&gt; 00:01:28,439<br>which you just plug in at home, connect your wired connection to bridge to the broader</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:28,439 –&gt; 00:01:29,439<br>internet.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:29,439 –&gt; 00:01:33,840<br>So one of the first things to realize about wireless is that unlike in a wired network, where</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:33,840 –&gt; 00:01:36,719<br>the medium and the wire is completely under control control.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:36,719 –&gt; 00:01:39,480<br>There’s nobody fighting you for the capacity of that wire.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:39,480 –&gt; 00:01:42,320<br>It’s for you and you alone.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:42,320 –&gt; 00:01:45,800<br>In the wireless environment, you’re using space, right?</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:45,799 –&gt; 00:01:48,959<br>You’re using the electromagnetic spectrum around you, which everyone else might be wanting</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:48,959 –&gt; 00:01:49,959<br>to use as well.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:49,959 –&gt; 00:01:52,519<br>It’s not a controlled medium.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:52,519 –&gt; 00:01:54,280<br>It’s a shared medium.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:54,280 –&gt; 00:01:57,840<br>And some practice what this means is that it is very tightly regulated.</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:57,840 –&gt; 00:02:03,239<br>So this is a map of how just in the United States, radio spectrum is allocated.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:03,239 –&gt; 00:02:04,239<br>It’s a radio spectrum.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:04,239 –&gt; 00:02:06,280<br>Here’s kind of the big picture of RF.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:06,280 –&gt; 00:02:11,439<br>We’re not a RF, but of electromagnetic spectrums, down from very low frequency stuff, all</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:11,439 –&gt; 00:02:13,159<br>the way up to cosmic rays.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:13,159 –&gt; 00:02:15,199<br>That’s this big thing down at the bottom.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:15,199 –&gt; 00:02:17,399<br>So this is, you can get from the department of commerce.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:17,399 –&gt; 00:02:19,719<br>There’s a free government document.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:19,719 –&gt; 00:02:23,799<br>And so generally data communication is occurring in this region down here, different kinds of</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:23,799 –&gt; 00:02:27,959<br>communication, either data communication, voice communication, etc.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:27,959 –&gt; 00:02:33,159<br>Up above what’s in this picture here, this yellow region is infrared.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:33,159 –&gt; 00:02:35,959<br>Then here’s visible light here.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:35,959 –&gt; 00:02:39,599<br>So here’s visible light.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:39,599 –&gt; 00:02:42,439<br>Here’s ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays, etc.</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:42,439 –&gt; 00:02:44,319<br>But RF is down here.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:44,319 –&gt; 00:02:48,079<br>So below visible light, lower frequencies.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:48,079 –&gt; 00:02:49,319<br>And here’s what the spectrum looks like.</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:49,319 –&gt; 00:02:53,120<br>And so you can see there’s a huge chunk of spectrum where it’s going all the way from</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:53,120 –&gt; 00:02:54,120<br>three kilohertz.</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:54,120 –&gt; 00:03:01,719<br>So when you have 3,000 waves per second, up to 300 gigahertz or 300 billion waves per second.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:01,719 –&gt; 00:03:06,799<br>So if you call it, if given that RF or that electromagnetic radiation moves at one foot</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:06,799 –&gt; 00:03:14,280<br>per nanosecond, at three kilohertz, you’re looking at waves that are on the order of 300,000</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:14,280 –&gt; 00:03:20,280<br>or 300,000 feet long.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:20,280 –&gt; 00:03:24,960<br>Whereas down to the 300 gigahertz range, you’re looking at waves that are one-three hundredth</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:24,960 –&gt; 00:03:25,960<br>of a foot long.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:25,960 –&gt; 00:03:29,000<br>So a huge, huge range of frequencies for all kinds of things.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:29,000 –&gt; 00:03:34,240<br>There’s TV, there’s radio, there’s data communication, there are maritime systems, there are military</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:34,240 –&gt; 00:03:36,240<br>systems, there are satellites, etc.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:36,240 –&gt; 00:03:42,599<br>But when we talk about access point networks and modern data communication systems, we’re</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:42,599 –&gt; 00:03:47,560<br>talking about these three, these four narrow chunks.</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:47,560 –&gt; 00:03:57,719<br>So these green ones are telephony.</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:57,719 –&gt; 00:03:59,959<br>So it’s down the 800, 900 megahertz range, 700.</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:59,959 –&gt; 00:04:01,439<br>This is the 1.9.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:01,439 –&gt; 00:04:03,719<br>Telephony, the Y-max and stuff starting to move up.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:03,719 –&gt; 00:04:07,439<br>But basically, 3G standards are down here.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:07,439 –&gt; 00:04:12,159<br>And these two blocks here, these two red blocks, this is Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:13,159 –&gt; 00:04:20,800<br>And so when you think about all of the data communication that we use today, phones and laptops,</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:20,800 –&gt; 00:04:25,120<br>it’s all squishing these two, two, these four tiny little slices.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:25,120 –&gt; 00:04:30,279<br>Now the really important thing to realize about wireless is that, as you can imagine, wireless</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:30,279 –&gt; 00:04:31,879<br>transmission, it’s not a wire.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:31,879 –&gt; 00:04:33,879<br>The wireless medium is not a wire.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:33,879 –&gt; 00:04:38,800<br>And what this means is that, unlike something propagated on a wire, where there’s some attenuation</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:38,800 –&gt; 00:04:44,800<br>or there’s some resistance in the copper, a wireless signal is radiating over space.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:44,800 –&gt; 00:04:49,000<br>Like in the simplest, if you have a perfect omnidirectional antenna, it’s radiating in this</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:49,000 –&gt; 00:04:51,520<br>case, and everything is in the sphere out.</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:51,520 –&gt; 00:04:57,600<br>And what this means is that the signal strength degrades with distance at r squared or faster.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:57,600 –&gt; 00:04:58,600<br>Right?</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:58,600 –&gt; 00:05:04,920<br>A signal, when you are twice as far away from a transmitter, the signal is at least attenuated</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:04,920 –&gt; 00:05:05,920<br>by 75%.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:05,920 –&gt; 00:05:11,400<br>And it’s at a quarter of the strength, just because think of the surface of a sphere.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:11,400 –&gt; 00:05:15,520<br>And so what this means, that unlike in a wired system where we can know, oh, the cable</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:15,520 –&gt; 00:05:18,800<br>as long as it’s good, it’s not under the hundred meters, we’re going to have a strong signal</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:18,800 –&gt; 00:05:19,800<br>strength.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:19,800 –&gt; 00:05:22,360<br>And wireless systems, you often have very weak signal strengths.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:22,360 –&gt; 00:05:25,280<br>In fact, people are going to try and get all the way to the edge because they want to be</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:25,280 –&gt; 00:05:29,120<br>sitting out on the lawn using their Wi-Fi access point.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:29,120 –&gt; 00:05:34,120<br>Furthermore, unlike a wire where it’s tightly controlled, there’s nobody doing stuff, wireless</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:34,120 –&gt; 00:05:35,560<br>is out in the world around you.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:35,560 –&gt; 00:05:38,680<br>So it can be that somebody steps between you and your access point.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:38,680 –&gt; 00:05:42,800<br>Now, suddenly all these wireless signals have to go through that person.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:42,800 –&gt; 00:05:44,360<br>They’re a big bag of water.</p>
<p>92<br>00:05:44,360 –&gt; 00:05:46,879<br>The wireless is going to become much, much weaker.</p>
<p>93<br>00:05:46,879 –&gt; 00:05:50,360<br>And so the signal strength is going to change significantly over time as people open doors,</p>
<p>94<br>00:05:50,360 –&gt; 00:05:53,639<br>people move around, as you move around, as they humidity changes.</p>
<p>95<br>00:05:53,639 –&gt; 00:05:56,399<br>Furthermore, there are everyone else is using the medium as well.</p>
<p>96<br>00:05:56,399 –&gt; 00:05:57,840<br>There’s lots of interference.</p>
<p>97<br>00:05:57,840 –&gt; 00:06:00,639<br>It’s not like you have this wire to yourself.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:00,639 –&gt; 00:06:04,360<br>Instead, the person next door might be using their wireless network, which is on the same</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:04,360 –&gt; 00:06:05,360<br>frequency.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:05,360 –&gt; 00:06:07,439<br>So let’s look at the first thing, signal strength.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:07,439 –&gt; 00:06:11,840<br>So the problem here is that there are obstructions in the real world and they can move around and</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:11,840 –&gt; 00:06:12,840<br>they weaken the signal.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:12,840 –&gt; 00:06:17,759<br>If you stand behind a metal plate, your wireless signal will be much weaker than if you stood</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:17,759 –&gt; 00:06:19,280<br>in front of it.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:19,280 –&gt; 00:06:21,480<br>Furthermore, wireless signals reflect.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:21,480 –&gt; 00:06:30,040<br>And so it can be that I am standing in some hallway here with my laptop.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:30,040 –&gt; 00:06:32,840<br>And there’s an access point here.</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:32,839 –&gt; 00:06:39,239<br>And it might be that the signal I get is some weird reflection off of different media,</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:39,239 –&gt; 00:06:41,599<br>off of different walls.</p>
<p>110<br>00:06:41,599 –&gt; 00:06:45,519<br>And the trick here is that in practice, this means that, for example, here I’m getting</p>
<p>111<br>00:06:45,519 –&gt; 00:06:49,959<br>this reflection, but I’m also getting a direct signal safe through these walls is that</p>
<p>112<br>00:06:49,959 –&gt; 00:06:54,479<br>unlike in a wire, in a wireless environment, you can have something called multi-path,</p>
<p>113<br>00:06:54,479 –&gt; 00:06:57,919<br>that you’re getting this signal, but you’re getting multiple copies of it across different</p>
<p>114<br>00:06:57,919 –&gt; 00:06:59,399<br>paths with different delays.</p>
<p>115<br>00:06:59,399 –&gt; 00:07:04,120<br>Think of it like echoes in a canyon where there’s the direct sound here, but then all</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:04,120 –&gt; 00:07:09,679<br>of these echoes taking different paths reflecting off the walls of a canyon.</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:09,679 –&gt; 00:07:13,479<br>There’s no perfectly uniform antenna, so if you move a little to the left, it could be that</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:13,479 –&gt; 00:07:16,399<br>antenna is no good and that’s actually much weaker where you are.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:16,399 –&gt; 00:07:20,359<br>So suddenly the signal goes down and you lose connection.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:20,359 –&gt; 00:07:22,599<br>Furthermore, all these things are continuously changing.</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:22,599 –&gt; 00:07:27,839<br>You can imagine you move a little bit and suddenly the multi-path changes, the reflections</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:27,839 –&gt; 00:07:28,839<br>change.</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:28,839 –&gt; 00:07:32,599<br>Like, imagine I move a little bit, the antenna is a little different, it’s oriented differently.</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:32,599 –&gt; 00:07:34,759<br>And so things are dynamically changing.</p>
<p>125<br>00:07:34,759 –&gt; 00:07:36,879<br>The environment around you, it’s not controlled.</p>
<p>126<br>00:07:36,879 –&gt; 00:07:40,799<br>It could be somebody closes their office door and suddenly your wireless signal goes out.</p>
<p>127<br>00:07:40,799 –&gt; 00:07:42,399<br>Just to give you a sense of what this looks like.</p>
<p>128<br>00:07:42,399 –&gt; 00:07:45,879<br>So this is some data collected by a student of mine.</p>
<p>129<br>00:07:45,879 –&gt; 00:07:49,439<br>I was now faculty at Ohio State, Canon.</p>
<p>130<br>00:07:49,439 –&gt; 00:07:55,799<br>And what it’s showing you is signal strength over time, down here on the bottom, was called</p>
<p>131<br>00:07:55,800 –&gt; 00:07:59,480<br>the Received Signal Strength Indicator, signal strength.</p>
<p>132<br>00:07:59,480 –&gt; 00:08:01,960<br>And then the top, the Observe Packet Reception Ratio.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:01,960 –&gt; 00:08:06,520<br>So this is for an 802.15.4 link that you measured.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:06,520 –&gt; 00:08:13,000<br>And so the transmitter is stationary, the receiver is stationary, and for every packet you</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:13,000 –&gt; 00:08:16,519<br>received, you log what was the received signal strength, and then you was observing what</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:16,519 –&gt; 00:08:19,000<br>percentage of packets were received over time.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:19,000 –&gt; 00:08:22,240<br>This red line shows the long-term average of this communication.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:22,240 –&gt; 00:08:25,280<br>So it’s actually pretty good around 93%.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:25,279 –&gt; 00:08:28,919<br>So what we can see is that over the space of just a couple of seconds, the signal strength</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:28,919 –&gt; 00:08:31,759<br>is pretty solid up at 84 dBm.</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:31,759 –&gt; 00:08:32,759<br>That’s the units.</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:32,759 –&gt; 00:08:34,720<br>It drops down a little bit.</p>
<p>143<br>00:08:34,720 –&gt; 00:08:36,360<br>Things get a little worse, drops down.</p>
<p>144<br>00:08:36,360 –&gt; 00:08:37,360<br>And then suddenly it drops.</p>
<p>145<br>00:08:37,360 –&gt; 00:08:42,879<br>And it just drops by around 6 or around 8 dBm or around 8 dB.</p>
<p>146<br>00:08:42,879 –&gt; 00:08:47,639<br>So around a factor of 10 or 5 to 10.</p>
<p>147<br>00:08:47,639 –&gt; 00:08:52,199<br>And then what happens is that that is below the signal strength in which this device can</p>
<p>148<br>00:08:52,200 –&gt; 00:08:53,200<br>receive packets.</p>
<p>149<br>00:08:53,200 –&gt; 00:08:56,960<br>So the Packer Reception Ratio drops to 0%.</p>
<p>150<br>00:08:56,960 –&gt; 00:09:00,600<br>For a short period, then it comes up and starts receiving packets again.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:00,600 –&gt; 00:09:05,000<br>And so just over the space of here, 10 seconds or so, we see that a link is going from</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:05,000 –&gt; 00:09:12,520<br>you 99% down to 85%, back up to 90%, down to 0%, to 70.</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:12,520 –&gt; 00:09:14,280<br>You see these significant changes over time.</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:14,280 –&gt; 00:09:19,360<br>And so somehow your network, think about TCP, think about all the retransmission schemes,</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:19,360 –&gt; 00:09:22,440<br>ask the deal with this kind of behavior.</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:22,440 –&gt; 00:09:27,560<br>So here I’m going to show you, in fact, a real time video of a network we had deployed</p>
<p>157<br>00:09:27,560 –&gt; 00:09:31,600<br>here at Stanford called Stanford Swann, the Stanford Wireless Access Network, is an 80 to</p>
<p>158<br>00:09:31,600 –&gt; 00:09:34,360<br>11 BG testbed, so Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>159<br>00:09:34,360 –&gt; 00:09:36,680<br>And it’s around 25 nodes or so.</p>
<p>160<br>00:09:36,680 –&gt; 00:09:41,360<br>And essentially what I’m going to show you is what this network looked like over 2.5 seconds.</p>
<p>161<br>00:09:41,360 –&gt; 00:09:44,360<br>So this is in a time step to 25 milliseconds.</p>
<p>162<br>00:09:44,360 –&gt; 00:09:46,039<br>There’s 100 time steps.</p>
<p>163<br>00:09:46,039 –&gt; 00:09:50,360<br>And each of these is a node, gates is a computer science department, packet is the E-department,</p>
<p>164<br>00:09:50,360 –&gt; 00:09:56,399<br>there’s this street in between, CEREMOL.</p>
<p>165<br>00:09:56,399 –&gt; 00:09:58,679<br>And I’m going to show you what this network looked like over time.</p>
<p>166<br>00:09:58,679 –&gt; 00:10:03,079<br>So for each node, there are lines between nodes, which show you the packet reception ratio</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:03,079 –&gt; 00:10:04,599<br>here of those links.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:04,599 –&gt; 00:10:09,519<br>A dark line means that all the packets are received, and a very light line or a no line means</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:09,519 –&gt; 00:10:16,519<br>that no packets are very few packets are received.</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:16,519 –&gt; 00:10:19,439<br>So watch what’s happening with these links, how quickly they’re changing.</p>
<p>171<br>00:10:19,439 –&gt; 00:10:21,480<br>This is 2.5 seconds.</p>
<p>172<br>00:10:21,480 –&gt; 00:10:26,000<br>And so we can see links are coming and going, they’re changing, you know, in the space of</p>
<p>173<br>00:10:26,000 –&gt; 00:10:27,319<br>25 milliseconds or less.</p>
<p>174<br>00:10:27,319 –&gt; 00:10:32,720<br>Look at this link here, it’s oscillating between 80% and 10% back and forth.</p>
<p>175<br>00:10:32,720 –&gt; 00:10:35,559<br>And look at the links between the two.</p>
<p>176<br>00:10:35,559 –&gt; 00:10:40,039<br>The point here is that in wireless networks like Wi-Fi networks, they’re highly, highly</p>
<p>177<br>00:10:40,039 –&gt; 00:10:41,519<br>dynamic.</p>
<p>178<br>00:10:41,519 –&gt; 00:10:45,039<br>So in addition to the issue of a signal strength changing over time, there’s also the issue</p>
<p>179<br>00:10:45,039 –&gt; 00:10:46,039<br>of interference.</p>
<p>180<br>00:10:46,039 –&gt; 00:10:50,399<br>So a lot of wireless communication today is occurring in unlicensed Wi-Fi, it’s access</p>
<p>181<br>00:10:50,399 –&gt; 00:10:53,439<br>point networks are current unlicensed bands, bands that don’t require a license from the</p>
<p>182<br>00:10:53,439 –&gt; 00:10:54,439<br>government.</p>
<p>183<br>00:10:54,439 –&gt; 00:10:55,439<br>Anyone can use this band.</p>
<p>184<br>00:10:55,439 –&gt; 00:10:58,919<br>And that’s why they’re so popular, because they’re free.</p>
<p>185<br>00:10:58,919 –&gt; 00:11:01,519<br>But then lots and lots of different technologies share the band.</p>
<p>186<br>00:11:01,519 –&gt; 00:11:09,199<br>So here’s a map, for example, of just what’s going on in the 2.4, basically the 2.5 gigahertz</p>
<p>187<br>00:11:09,199 –&gt; 00:11:10,199<br>range.</p>
<p>188<br>00:11:10,199 –&gt; 00:11:12,840<br>This is Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi is a lot of frequencies you can see.</p>
<p>189<br>00:11:12,840 –&gt; 00:11:17,299<br>Here’s Wi-Fi 802.11b and these different ranges here you can see it’s bandwidth, the 22</p>
<p>190<br>00:11:17,299 –&gt; 00:11:20,000<br>megahertz, here’s channels 1, 6, and 11.</p>
<p>191<br>00:11:20,000 –&gt; 00:11:27,039<br>But at the same frequency ranges, there’s 802.154, ZigBee, a low power wireless system,</p>
<p>192<br>00:11:27,039 –&gt; 00:11:29,000<br>which is using the same range of frequencies.</p>
<p>193<br>00:11:29,000 –&gt; 00:11:31,480<br>So Bluetooth uses the same range of frequencies.</p>
<p>194<br>00:11:31,480 –&gt; 00:11:36,759<br>This means that something in 802.11 can receive interference or something in 802.154 and vice</p>
<p>195<br>00:11:36,759 –&gt; 00:11:37,759<br>versa.</p>
<p>196<br>00:11:37,759 –&gt; 00:11:41,440<br>These are challenges that all these systems have to deal with, that they might have good</p>
<p>197<br>00:11:41,440 –&gt; 00:11:44,759<br>signal, they might have low noise, but then someone’s interfering with them.</p>
<p>198<br>00:11:44,759 –&gt; 00:11:48,720<br>And so for example, if you just look at what wireless activity is like over time, this</p>
<p>199<br>00:11:48,720 –&gt; 00:11:56,200<br>is this nice graph which on Prokosh Kanoali, he’s now a professor at University of Houston</p>
<p>200<br>00:11:56,200 –&gt; 00:11:57,200<br>generated.</p>
<p>201<br>00:11:57,200 –&gt; 00:12:05,960<br>This is a ticket at this data from USC, which is where he used to be a student, PhD student.</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:05,960 –&gt; 00:12:08,440<br>And you can see, look at all those Wi-Fi activities.</p>
<p>203<br>00:12:08,440 –&gt; 00:12:12,160<br>So here’s time in seconds, some 0 to 2 minutes, and different Wi-Fi channels went to 11.</p>
<p>204<br>00:12:12,160 –&gt; 00:12:15,680<br>You can see that these channels, 1 and 11, are really, really busy, are orange, showing</p>
<p>205<br>00:12:15,680 –&gt; 00:12:18,480<br>lots and lots of Wi-Fi activity.</p>
<p>206<br>00:12:18,480 –&gt; 00:12:22,160<br>And so the lessons take away here is that wireless networks are becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>207<br>00:12:22,160 –&gt; 00:12:27,160<br>We’d much rather just connect to the internet wirelessly rather than plug a wire into our laptop.</p>
<p>208<br>00:12:27,639 –&gt; 00:12:31,839<br>But generally they don’t work as well, though less reliable, they’re more flaky.</p>
<p>209<br>00:12:31,839 –&gt; 00:12:36,719<br>And this is because of the fact that they’re in this shared medium that’s uncontrolled.</p>
<p>210<br>00:12:36,719 –&gt; 00:12:43,639<br>Lots of devices are using it, the environment’s changing around them, and there’s lots of interference.</p>
<p>211<br>00:12:43,639 –&gt; 00:12:50,480<br>And so in practice, what this means is that to try to get wireless to be good enough,</p>
<p>212<br>00:12:50,480 –&gt; 00:12:57,000<br>as to be usable, do these different properties and different behaviors.</p>
<p>213<br>00:12:57,000 –&gt; 00:13:01,240<br>Wireless actually ends up using very different algorithms and protocols.</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:01,240 –&gt; 00:13:04,759<br>So wireless link layers look different than wireless link layers.</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:04,759 –&gt; 00:13:09,000<br>Wireless media access control systems look different than wired ones.</p>
<p>216<br>00:13:09,000 –&gt; 00:13:13,960<br>So this next series of videos is going to go into some of those differences and explain how wireless today works.</p>
