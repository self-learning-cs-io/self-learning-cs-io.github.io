                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,080<br>So I’m here today with Tom Etzel, who I’ve known for a number of years. Tom has been involved</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,080 –&gt; 00:00:13,080<br>in the design of switches and routers for a long time now. He was a master student at Stanford</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,080 –&gt; 00:00:18,760<br>and after that has worked for a number of companies, most notably at Cisco, where he’s arguably</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,760 –&gt; 00:00:24,879<br>responsible for the design and deployment of more Ethernet switches and routers than anybody</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:24,879 –&gt; 00:00:29,760<br>else on the planet. So he is extremely well qualified to talk to us today about the</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,760 –&gt; 00:00:37,439<br>design of switches and routers. Hi Tom. So the first question I had for you, Tom, is</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,439 –&gt; 00:00:45,439<br>so in CS144 we learn about Ethernet switches and IP routers and their basic functionality.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:45,439 –&gt; 00:00:49,280<br>Can you tell us a little bit about the history of routers and Ethernet switches when they</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:49,280 –&gt; 00:00:54,920<br>were first built and sold and were they based on CPUs or specialized hardware?</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:55,079 –&gt; 00:01:04,519<br>Okay. So I think the first Ethernet switch, or maybe not the first, but certainly the first</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:04,519 –&gt; 00:01:10,040<br>very, very successful one was a product that we designed here in Cisco called the Catalyst 5000.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:10,760 –&gt; 00:01:18,120<br>And the Catalyst 5000 initially was a simple layer to switch a multi-port bridge, if you will.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:19,079 –&gt; 00:01:28,600<br>And it was based upon some custom silicon that we designed. And there was one ASIC, one application</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:28,600 –&gt; 00:01:32,680<br>specific in a grain circuit, if you don’t know what an ASIC is, one piece of custom silicon.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:33,320 –&gt; 00:01:41,480<br>And that was repeated for every report in the system. And we had a line card that was 12 ports,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:41,480 –&gt; 00:01:47,800<br>we had 12 of these ASICs on it. And then there were several of these line cards in a chat seat.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:47,800 –&gt; 00:01:53,320<br>And all of those devices were connected with a common bus across the back point.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:54,280 –&gt; 00:02:04,439<br>And that was built shortly after we came into Cisco in 1995.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:05,239 –&gt; 00:02:11,639<br>And we were immediately trying to figure out how to add layer 3 capability, how to add routing to</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:11,639 –&gt; 00:02:18,680<br>that. Cisco meanwhile had a router, and we were a part of Cisco, it’s a main part of Cisco</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:18,680 –&gt; 00:02:26,439<br>had a router, but it was based on a microprocessor, it was a MIPS processor, all done in software.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:27,400 –&gt; 00:02:37,400<br>And we began to investigate what it would take to do routing in hardware. And the initial response</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:37,400 –&gt; 00:02:44,680<br>was that it couldn’t be done, and then talking people was like, yeah, but it’s way too complicated,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:44,680 –&gt; 00:02:49,000<br>it would take too long to explain. And we couldn’t quite understand what the problem was,</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:49,080 –&gt; 00:02:56,680<br>kept on asking and asking and asking. And eventually we really came to a conclusion that it could</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:56,680 –&gt; 00:03:02,520<br>be done, and it was just people hadn’t thought about doing it in hardware. The initial product,</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:02,520 –&gt; 00:03:12,439<br>what it was, it allowed the first packet of a flow to be bridged to a router blade in the system,</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:12,439 –&gt; 00:03:20,359<br>a router on a line card in hardware. That router was running in software on the MIPS processor,</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:20,359 –&gt; 00:03:26,919<br>it would route the packet as it always has. But when that packet, initial packet was sent to</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:26,919 –&gt; 00:03:34,199<br>this software router, we learned in hardware, or passed in hardware, the flow information about</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:34,199 –&gt; 00:03:40,759<br>that packet. And then when it returned from the software router, we compared the return flow</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:40,759 –&gt; 00:03:45,799<br>with the one that went to the software router, and we could see what was different about the packets.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:45,799 –&gt; 00:03:51,159<br>And the thing that was different, of course, was it was a new layer to cater. So then we would</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:51,159 –&gt; 00:03:57,000<br>remember that layer to cater. And then all subsequent packets, we would just do the rewrite</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:57,000 –&gt; 00:04:01,959<br>layer to cater that we had learned from the software. So the hardware and software were actually</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:02,759 –&gt; 00:04:07,959<br>almost completely independently, and the hardware was essentially cashing the layer three routes.</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:07,960 –&gt; 00:04:15,320<br>So it was cashing still used today. So, Rosina?</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:17,960 –&gt; 00:04:30,439<br>Yes, it’s used in, it depends on the products. In general, we think about a fast path and a slow path.</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:31,079 –&gt; 00:04:37,639<br>And you can think of as a fast path as a cache. Sometimes that cache may be done in hardware,</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:37,639 –&gt; 00:04:44,759<br>sometimes it may be done in software. Quite often, the first packet will go to the slow path,</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:45,319 –&gt; 00:04:54,519<br>or alternatively a packet that has a set of options, we go to this slow path and sort of the normal</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:54,519 –&gt; 00:05:01,639<br>packet to go to a fast path. But the technique of cashing comes in goats over the years,</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:02,759 –&gt; 00:05:10,199<br>and it sort of depends on the set of problems we’re trying to solve and the constraints that we’re</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:10,199 –&gt; 00:05:17,000<br>solving goes under. So in class, we learn about the sort of the basic forwarding. So, you know,</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:17,000 –&gt; 00:05:22,279<br>learning for layer two addresses and then forwarding or broadcasting if you don’t know the address,</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:22,279 –&gt; 00:05:25,879<br>and then for layer three, checking the version number,</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:25,879 –&gt; 00:05:31,639<br>decromating the TTL, updating the checksum and forwarding to the correct egress. Presumably,</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:31,639 –&gt; 00:05:35,719<br>Ethernet switches and routers have more features and functions than that, and they do other things.</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:36,759 –&gt; 00:05:41,479<br>What are the main, you know, what would be the sort of the main ticket items that really</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:43,559 –&gt; 00:05:47,639<br>make that box more complex or differentiate one box from another?</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:48,120 –&gt; 00:05:57,719<br>So, the list of things that they do is a daunting list. That basic function that you just mentioned</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:58,439 –&gt; 00:06:05,000<br>is essentially what we did in that very first hardware wrapper that we were cashing with the</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:05,000 –&gt; 00:06:14,519<br>information. The things that we do is a lot of work done around security features.</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:15,079 –&gt; 00:06:21,719<br>Sometimes it’s just simple things like checking to be sure that you don’t have</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:24,199 –&gt; 00:06:31,959<br>zero offset fragments. Just simple security checks in addition to checking the version number.</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:35,000 –&gt; 00:06:40,039<br>Of course, when you decromate a TTL, you have to make sure that you redirect the packet to</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:40,680 –&gt; 00:06:51,720<br>to the local CPU if the TTL goes to a zero. You need to provide all sorts of protections</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:51,720 –&gt; 00:06:58,759<br>of the internal CPU. You don’t want to be susceptible to denial service attacks. So,</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:58,759 –&gt; 00:07:03,879<br>there’s all sorts of filtering and pasting that occurs on a packet, on the control plane packets,</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:03,879 –&gt; 00:07:14,759<br>and go to the local CPU. There’s, you know, not the cast. It’s a complete nightmare to implement</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:14,759 –&gt; 00:07:20,439<br>and has a hundred different features to make it work right. It’s the most difficult thing that we do.</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:22,199 –&gt; 00:07:27,560<br>There are a number of monitoring functions that have to occur in these switches. Probably the</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:27,560 –&gt; 00:07:33,719<br>most basic and arguably the most useful is something we call a switch core analyzer, where we can</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:33,800 –&gt; 00:07:39,800<br>mirror all of the traffic going to a particular port on some other port, or all the traffic coming in from</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:39,800 –&gt; 00:07:46,760<br>a port to another port where we’ve been sent to some sort of analyzer. And then, of course, you</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:46,760 –&gt; 00:07:53,080<br>want to have multiple of these analyzers running simultaneously. Then you want to have an analyzer</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:53,080 –&gt; 00:07:58,120<br>on a remote switch that can monitor the traffic on the local switch. And so then you have to figure out</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:58,120 –&gt; 00:08:04,280<br>how to tunnel that information across the network. You know, calling a service,</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:04,280 –&gt; 00:08:11,480<br>active-cune management that the list goes on and on with these routers, switches, and routers.</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:11,480 –&gt; 00:08:15,720<br>Yeah, so they’re really complex beasts. And they, I guess they used in all sorts of different</p>
<p>71<br>00:08:15,720 –&gt; 00:08:22,439<br>places as well. And they, in the home, the enterprise, wider networks, data centers, access networks,</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:22,439 –&gt; 00:08:29,399<br>edge. Are they substantially different? Are the boxes, the systems, and the way that they’re</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:29,399 –&gt; 00:08:37,720<br>built substantially different for those different different contexts? Yes, they are. If you</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:39,320 –&gt; 00:08:46,600<br>look at the router in your home, the feature set isn’t particularly sophisticated. The bandwidths</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:46,600 –&gt; 00:08:53,320<br>are low, extremely low. Of course, you know, quite often they have wireless built into them.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:54,759 –&gt; 00:09:02,840<br>And so you can, those are usually built to use things for merchant silicon and running an</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:02,840 –&gt; 00:09:11,399<br>operating system there, perhaps based upon Linux. The bigger boxes, they come in either fixed form</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:11,399 –&gt; 00:09:17,399<br>factors, meaning that the number of ports is fixed. You can’t change out line cards. And then</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:17,399 –&gt; 00:09:22,199<br>there’s the big chassis, modular chassis where you have multiple line cards and multiple different</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:22,199 –&gt; 00:09:31,319<br>kinds of thinner faces that can go in on each one of those line cards. And the autocontactors</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:31,319 –&gt; 00:09:39,079<br>internally for the small switches, it’s typically a switch on a chip. On the bigger systems, of course,</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:39,080 –&gt; 00:09:45,400<br>that doesn’t work. There’s more ports than you can fit on a single chip or the entire system is</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:45,400 –&gt; 00:09:51,879<br>spread across multiple line cards. And sometimes even multiple chassis and multiple racks of chassis.</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:52,600 –&gt; 00:10:02,600<br>And those systems tend to be based on crossbars or some sort of centralized, relatively simple</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:02,600 –&gt; 00:10:08,759<br>high performance switching element that switches the traffic between the line cards or between the</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:08,759 –&gt; 00:10:18,519<br>port devices. The port devices themselves or line cards are generally, the cell can use there.</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:18,519 –&gt; 00:10:25,720<br>It looks a lot like this single switch on a chip in that one device may support 48 ports of 10</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:25,720 –&gt; 00:10:35,879<br>gigabit ethernet or 48 ports of 40 gigabit ethernet. And the emphasis in the data center will be</p>
<p>89<br>00:10:35,879 –&gt; 00:10:44,840<br>on bandwidth and low cost. The emphasis on the campus will be not as much on bandwidth, but it’s</p>
<p>90<br>00:10:44,840 –&gt; 00:10:53,720<br>certainly based on cost and a number of access features around authentication and identification</p>
<p>91<br>00:10:53,720 –&gt; 00:11:02,680<br>at the endpoints. In the when it’s going to be a lot of emphasis around bandwidth and buffering</p>
<p>92<br>00:11:02,680 –&gt; 00:11:09,000<br>and different kinds of interfaces as well as quality service becomes important factor. So yeah,</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:09,000 –&gt; 00:11:15,240<br>they’re all different different flavors. So over the years as these switches and routers have evolved</p>
<p>94<br>00:11:15,240 –&gt; 00:11:20,600<br>and developed, what would have been the main advances in technology or architecture that have allowed</p>
<p>95<br>00:11:20,600 –&gt; 00:11:27,720<br>them to scale? Have they been primarily coming from the underlying technology like Moore’s Law,</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:27,720 –&gt; 00:11:32,279<br>have there been specific technologies that have helped networking switches and routers or</p>
<p>97<br>00:11:32,279 –&gt; 00:11:36,440<br>specific architectures? What’s allowed them to keep up with the performance demands?</p>
<p>98<br>00:11:37,960 –&gt; 00:11:44,680<br>Well, yeah, if we followed Moore’s law strictly, probably the fastest link in the world would be 10</p>
<p>99<br>00:11:44,679 –&gt; 00:11:50,279<br>gigabits. And of course, we’re switching orders of magnitude and faster than that today. So</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:51,159 –&gt; 00:11:58,519<br>networks have had to go through and network boxes have had to go through architectural changes to</p>
<p>101<br>00:11:58,519 –&gt; 00:12:05,079<br>overcome the limitations of Moore’s Law. So absolutely, we take advantage of Moore’s Law as much as we</p>
<p>102<br>00:12:05,079 –&gt; 00:12:11,719<br>can. But if I look at some of the switches that I’ve been involved in designing and bear in mind that</p>
<p>103<br>00:12:11,720 –&gt; 00:12:21,960<br>these switches account for 60 to 70 percent of the entire switching market. So these are significant</p>
<p>104<br>00:12:21,960 –&gt; 00:12:31,480<br>platforms. The original catalyst 5000 product line was based upon a bus. It was a common shared bus,</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:31,480 –&gt; 00:12:37,720<br>the entire bandwidth of that switch was 1 gigabit per second. And it was an aggregation of 10</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:37,720 –&gt; 00:12:44,360<br>gigabit links with some 100 gigabit links involved. But that bus quickly ran out of speed. It was</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:45,080 –&gt; 00:12:50,920<br>the performance of the bus was based upon how fast you could signal on a single wire and how many</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:50,920 –&gt; 00:12:57,160<br>of those wires you could put in parallel. And that was the limit of the entire chassis. The next</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:57,160 –&gt; 00:13:04,440<br>generation of that platform, the catalyst 6000, which is still a, I think it still made me a billion</p>
<p>110<br>00:13:04,440 –&gt; 00:13:15,080<br>dollar product for Cisco. It was delivered in 1998, I believe, in 1998 and 1999. It moved to a</p>
<p>111<br>00:13:15,080 –&gt; 00:13:21,880<br>crossbar architecture. And the crossbar architecture allowed us to have much faster signaling on each</p>
<p>112<br>00:13:21,880 –&gt; 00:13:28,520<br>wire and to have signaling between ports independent of one another. So it wasn’t the base bus</p>
<p>113<br>00:13:28,520 –&gt; 00:13:34,280<br>base architecture. However, that was not an arbitrary fabric. I know Nick, you’ve done a lot of</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:34,279 –&gt; 00:13:40,600<br>work on arbitration and the importance of arbitration. But we actually, you know, most networks in</p>
<p>115<br>00:13:40,600 –&gt; 00:13:47,959<br>the world and the 2010 actually did not have arbitration in them. It was basically, you set the</p>
<p>116<br>00:13:47,959 –&gt; 00:13:53,559<br>packets into the crossbar and for the best luck that it’s delivered to the other end of the problems.</p>
<p>117<br>00:13:54,519 –&gt; 00:14:05,159<br>Much less expensive and much less complicated. In 2010, time frame, maybe 2008 time frame,</p>
<p>118<br>00:14:05,159 –&gt; 00:14:10,599<br>we really started to feel the pressure on that crossbar and we added arbitration to it to</p>
<p>119<br>00:14:10,599 –&gt; 00:14:18,519<br>improve the performance of that crossbar. And also allowed packets to be sprayed across the</p>
<p>120<br>00:14:18,519 –&gt; 00:14:27,240<br>crossbars to get better performance. So we had to do packet reordering on the Egress side to</p>
<p>121<br>00:14:27,240 –&gt; 00:14:35,159<br>guarantee packet order. So those are some of the architectural changes. We’ve moved from</p>
<p>122<br>00:14:35,159 –&gt; 00:14:43,240<br>external memories to on-ship memories. You said embedded DRAM was popular for a while. Now we’re</p>
<p>123<br>00:14:43,240 –&gt; 00:14:49,720<br>moving more back to embedded static RAM. That’s just following the technologies that are available to</p>
<p>124<br>00:14:49,720 –&gt; 00:14:58,440<br>us from the silicon perspective. But generally packaging on, packaging on custom ASICS has not</p>
<p>125<br>00:14:58,440 –&gt; 00:15:06,039<br>advanced nearly as much as the silicon itself. And so it’s cheaper to build a bigger die than to have</p>
<p>126<br>00:15:06,039 –&gt; 00:15:14,279<br>multiple smaller devices connected together. Great, thank you. So in class, we had one speaker that</p>
<p>127<br>00:15:14,279 –&gt; 00:15:22,439<br>was talking about SDN software defined networking. And basic idea is that opening up more programmatic</p>
<p>128<br>00:15:22,439 –&gt; 00:15:28,519<br>control to the switching sort of forwarding plane from either from the customer, the owner,</p>
<p>129<br>00:15:28,519 –&gt; 00:15:35,159<br>operator, the network, or at least software that’s under that control. So if this change or as</p>
<p>130<br>00:15:35,159 –&gt; 00:15:40,519<br>this change happens, will switches need to change? How will they change do you think?</p>
<p>131<br>00:15:45,000 –&gt; 00:15:54,759<br>You know, that’s a big point of some debate. I ultimately don’t think that the underlying hardware</p>
<p>132<br>00:15:54,759 –&gt; 00:16:04,360<br>is going to change in ways that a lot of people think it might change. One part of what we hear</p>
<p>133<br>00:16:04,360 –&gt; 00:16:14,919<br>about this SDN is around open flow. And open flow would indicate that maybe there should be some</p>
<p>134<br>00:16:14,919 –&gt; 00:16:20,840<br>architectural changes to the underlying silicon. And I’m not convinced that that’s going to be what</p>
<p>135<br>00:16:20,840 –&gt; 00:16:27,240<br>happens. I think that the underlying silicon and the fields that it uses and how it’s structured</p>
<p>136<br>00:16:28,600 –&gt; 00:16:34,039<br>actually works quite well for us. And whether that’s being controlled through a centralized</p>
<p>137<br>00:16:34,039 –&gt; 00:16:42,439<br>controller or not, I think is completely orthogonal to whether you use open flow or open</p>
<p>138<br>00:16:42,439 –&gt; 00:16:49,319<br>system. However, there is another thing that’s happening, which is I would care for at least more</p>
<p>139<br>00:16:49,319 –&gt; 00:16:55,799<br>than SDN as a virtualization of the network. And that virtualization is done through overlay</p>
<p>140<br>00:16:55,799 –&gt; 00:17:04,519<br>technologies. There are a lot of different overlay technologies. The VXLAN is one in VGERI is</p>
<p>141<br>00:17:04,519 –&gt; 00:17:12,839<br>another STT is one, Lisp is one, Fabric Path, the Trill, there’s a proliferation of these</p>
<p>142<br>00:17:12,839 –&gt; 00:17:19,639<br>technologies. I think the industry will settle on a small number of them. You know, I have my best,</p>
<p>143<br>00:17:19,640 –&gt; 00:17:28,280<br>but we won’t go into exactly what I’m betting on right now. But this overlay technology, I think,</p>
<p>144<br>00:17:28,280 –&gt; 00:17:39,320<br>really does provide a fundamental value in the network and a switched built four years ago,</p>
<p>145<br>00:17:39,319 –&gt; 00:17:47,319<br>probably can’t do it or can’t do it at scale or can’t do it performance and performance and</p>
<p>146<br>00:17:49,399 –&gt; 00:17:59,720<br>performance and scale. So I think new hardware will enable these overlay technologies and will</p>
<p>147<br>00:17:59,720 –&gt; 00:18:05,480<br>continue to improve on what you can do with that overlay technology. Great, thank you. Would you</p>
<p>148<br>00:18:05,559 –&gt; 00:18:13,559<br>want to call that SDN? Sure. One last question. So if students want to learn more about design of</p>
<p>149<br>00:18:13,559 –&gt; 00:18:21,799<br>switches and routers, I mean, are there still lots of job opportunities? Is it still a growing and</p>
<p>150<br>00:18:21,799 –&gt; 00:18:27,720<br>expanding field? We hear all sorts of talk of the hardware side of switching routers,</p>
<p>151<br>00:18:28,839 –&gt; 00:18:34,680<br>becoming a sort of a smaller field. And we see everybody going off to work for Google and</p>
<p>152<br>00:18:34,680 –&gt; 00:18:41,320<br>Facebook. Is it still an exciting and growing field to be working in?</p>
<p>153<br>00:18:46,200 –&gt; 00:18:54,279<br>It’s an interesting question. I’ve been doing this since 1985. So it’s been quite a long time.</p>
<p>154<br>00:18:55,000 –&gt; 00:19:05,879<br>And there have been periods of great excitement. We first came up with the switching technology</p>
<p>155<br>00:19:05,879 –&gt; 00:19:13,240<br>in the industry, was happening in the internet, was starting to become a big deal and networks came</p>
<p>156<br>00:19:13,240 –&gt; 00:19:21,240<br>into their own. That was a very exciting period of time. I would say that there was a period where</p>
<p>157<br>00:19:21,240 –&gt; 00:19:26,200<br>there wasn’t a lot happening. That it was, yes, we’re going to build a faster switch. We’re going to</p>
<p>158<br>00:19:26,200 –&gt; 00:19:37,480<br>add a couple of knobs here and there. And that was sort of the 2000 to 2010 time period. I think we</p>
<p>159<br>00:19:37,480 –&gt; 00:19:47,720<br>are experiencing a bit of a revolution now. A lot of it actually has, I think that the catalyst</p>
<p>160<br>00:19:47,720 –&gt; 00:19:53,319<br>for it has been some of the work that you have done. And with the OpenFlow and this whole idea</p>
<p>161<br>00:19:53,319 –&gt; 00:20:03,720<br>of SDN networks, and let’s do some virtualization. And it’s not that that technology came from one</p>
<p>162<br>00:20:03,720 –&gt; 00:20:11,400<br>source necessarily, but was sort of being thought about and baking in a lot of the labs. And now it</p>
<p>163<br>00:20:11,400 –&gt; 00:20:22,360<br>is really burst onto the scene. And it really has been actually challenging for me and</p>
<p>164<br>00:20:23,400 –&gt; 00:20:34,360<br>very interesting doing the internet switch design again. And that technology will mature and</p>
<p>165<br>00:20:34,360 –&gt; 00:20:40,120<br>it will slow down and presumably something else will come along after that. Is it a growing industry?</p>
<p>166<br>00:20:40,919 –&gt; 00:20:50,679<br>There are fewer and fewer companies developing their own hardware. There is Cisco of course, does it.</p>
<p>167<br>00:20:52,919 –&gt; 00:20:58,679<br>Juniper develops some of their own hardware. It’s very difficult for a startup to get the</p>
<p>168<br>00:20:58,679 –&gt; 00:21:04,519<br>funding to develop new hardware so they tend to use merchant silicon. And so if you are looking to</p>
<p>169<br>00:21:04,519 –&gt; 00:21:14,039<br>design switch hardware, I think there are fewer opportunities in that space. However, I do think</p>
<p>170<br>00:21:14,680 –&gt; 00:21:20,839<br>there are some pretty interesting things to do in that area. And in my own case, I was lucky enough</p>
<p>171<br>00:21:20,839 –&gt; 00:21:27,319<br>to be in a startup and currently am in a startup that does do hardware development of switches.</p>
<p>172<br>00:21:27,319 –&gt; 00:21:36,439<br>And I’ve got a list of so long of things that I want to do and I can’t do all of them.</p>
<p>173<br>00:21:36,439 –&gt; 00:21:42,519<br>And I’m sure other people have a list of ideas and pretty cool things that can be done in those</p>
<p>174<br>00:21:42,519 –&gt; 00:21:51,639<br>switches in the hardware. So it’s not that all of the great ideas that have been thought of. It’s not</p>
<p>175<br>00:21:51,640 –&gt; 00:22:00,520<br>that bad, but it’s not as it was in the late 90s. And if you have some internship opportunities come</p>
<p>176<br>00:22:00,520 –&gt; 00:22:08,280<br>out, send me some details and I’ll forward them to the class. I absolutely would love to hire</p>
<p>177<br>00:22:08,280 –&gt; 00:22:16,280<br>interns. I would bring on many interns. Okay, wonderful. Let’s chat about that. So thanks</p>
<p>178<br>00:22:16,279 –&gt; 00:22:21,240<br>so much Tom. Really appreciate it. This is really interesting. Provided the kind of insight that we</p>
<p>179<br>00:22:21,240 –&gt; 00:22:25,720<br>that we can’t get in the classroom or from textbooks normally. So it’s extremely useful. Thank you.</p>
<p>180<br>00:22:26,680 –&gt; 00:22:28,680<br>Okay, thank you.</p>
