                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,279<br>influence on the way that AT&amp;T used and deployed BGP and routing in its network.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,279 –&gt; 00:00:09,640<br>Since she’s been a Princeton,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:09,640 –&gt; 00:00:12,000<br>has done a lot of research in routing,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,000 –&gt; 00:00:13,919<br>inter-domain routing, BGP,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:13,919 –&gt; 00:00:16,320<br>and laid some of the groundwork for what we now know as</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:16,320 –&gt; 00:00:19,359<br>software-defined networking through her work on 40.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:19,359 –&gt; 00:00:21,120<br>Hi, Jen. How you doing?</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:21,120 –&gt; 00:00:22,640<br>Yeah, I’m about yourself.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:22,640 –&gt; 00:00:27,920<br>This is one of the interviews that we’re doing for</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:27,920 –&gt; 00:00:31,480<br>the online class at Stanford called CS144,</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:31,480 –&gt; 00:00:33,440<br>an introduction to computer networks.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:33,440 –&gt; 00:00:37,520<br>This is the first of the interviews that we’re doing using Hangout.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:37,520 –&gt; 00:00:38,920<br>We’re going to see how this goes.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:38,920 –&gt; 00:00:42,480<br>Excuse us if we get some of the technicalities a little bit wrong.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:42,480 –&gt; 00:00:45,120<br>I wanted to ask you a question to start with.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:45,120 –&gt; 00:00:48,840<br>Can you give us just as a brief history of BGP,</p>
<p>17<br>00:00:48,840 –&gt; 00:00:51,320<br>how it came about, what were the basic ideas,</p>
<p>18<br>00:00:51,320 –&gt; 00:00:53,840<br>and why it’s lasted so long?</p>
<p>19<br>00:00:54,240 –&gt; 00:00:56,840<br>BGP is essentially the glue that holds</p>
<p>20<br>00:00:56,840 –&gt; 00:00:58,640<br>the disparate parts of the internet together.</p>
<p>21<br>00:00:58,640 –&gt; 00:01:01,520<br>It grew up hand in hand with the internet.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:01,520 –&gt; 00:01:05,000<br>When the ARP-NET was running in the 80s,</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:05,000 –&gt; 00:01:07,439<br>there was really one core network,</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:07,439 –&gt; 00:01:09,359<br>the ARP-NET itself, and a lot of other networks</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:09,359 –&gt; 00:01:10,640<br>that connected to it.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:10,640 –&gt; 00:01:12,960<br>There wasn’t really a need for a sophisticated</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:12,960 –&gt; 00:01:14,200<br>inter-domain routing protocol.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:14,200 –&gt; 00:01:16,120<br>The network was essentially a tree.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:16,120 –&gt; 00:01:18,640<br>Once the NSF-NET was being commissioned,</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:18,640 –&gt; 00:01:21,280<br>there was a need to support much more flexible ways</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:21,280 –&gt; 00:01:22,920<br>for networks to connect to one another.</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:22,920 –&gt; 00:01:24,879<br>In particular, networks might connect to each other,</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:24,879 –&gt; 00:01:26,920<br>not only to the NSF-NET backbone.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:26,920 –&gt; 00:01:29,359<br>It became necessary to deal with loops,</p>
<p>35<br>00:01:29,359 –&gt; 00:01:32,079<br>because the topologies were now potentially cyclic.</p>
<p>36<br>00:01:32,079 –&gt; 00:01:33,920<br>BGP was designed to support routing</p>
<p>37<br>00:01:33,920 –&gt; 00:01:36,320<br>on more general topologies.</p>
<p>38<br>00:01:36,320 –&gt; 00:01:38,560<br>Over time, it’s really grown along with the internet</p>
<p>39<br>00:01:38,560 –&gt; 00:01:40,280<br>to have to grapple with a lot of issues,</p>
<p>40<br>00:01:40,280 –&gt; 00:01:43,760<br>dealing with scaleability, running out of address space,</p>
<p>41<br>00:01:43,760 –&gt; 00:01:45,760<br>having a large number of address blocks</p>
<p>42<br>00:01:45,760 –&gt; 00:01:48,280<br>that have to be carried within the protocol.</p>
<p>43<br>00:01:48,280 –&gt; 00:01:50,520<br>It has also grown as the business relationships</p>
<p>44<br>00:01:50,520 –&gt; 00:01:52,200<br>between domains and the services</p>
<p>45<br>00:01:52,200 –&gt; 00:01:55,560<br>that providers want to offer to their customers have evolved.</p>
<p>46<br>00:01:55,560 –&gt; 00:01:58,040<br>Now there’s much more of a need years later</p>
<p>47<br>00:01:58,040 –&gt; 00:02:00,560<br>to be able to allow a service provider to pick one path</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:00,560 –&gt; 00:02:02,640<br>that might be longer than another,</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:02,640 –&gt; 00:02:04,680<br>because it might be economically advantageous.</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:04,680 –&gt; 00:02:07,040<br>Maybe it’s cheaper, maybe it has better performance</p>
<p>51<br>00:02:07,040 –&gt; 00:02:08,680<br>despite being longer.</p>
<p>52<br>00:02:08,680 –&gt; 00:02:10,800<br>Similarly, for providers to offer services</p>
<p>53<br>00:02:10,800 –&gt; 00:02:12,280<br>like virtual private networks,</p>
<p>54<br>00:02:12,280 –&gt; 00:02:14,680<br>that don’t even connect to the internet at all.</p>
<p>55<br>00:02:14,680 –&gt; 00:02:17,480<br>We’ve seen over time BGP adapt in many ways</p>
<p>56<br>00:02:17,480 –&gt; 00:02:20,280<br>to address both of those kinds of concerns.</p>
<p>57<br>00:02:20,280 –&gt; 00:02:21,879<br>So when you look at BGP now,</p>
<p>58<br>00:02:21,879 –&gt; 00:02:24,599<br>what do you think of its main good and bad attributes?</p>
<p>59<br>00:02:24,599 –&gt; 00:02:27,599<br>What are its strengths and weaknesses?</p>
<p>60<br>00:02:27,599 –&gt; 00:02:30,120<br>So basically, anything that makes the internet the internet,</p>
<p>61<br>00:02:30,120 –&gt; 00:02:31,439<br>which is essentially what BGP does,</p>
<p>62<br>00:02:31,439 –&gt; 00:02:33,560<br>is sort of puts the internet in internet,</p>
<p>63<br>00:02:33,560 –&gt; 00:02:37,280<br>has to reconcile the competing and conflicting goals</p>
<p>64<br>00:02:37,280 –&gt; 00:02:38,560<br>of the different service providers</p>
<p>65<br>00:02:38,560 –&gt; 00:02:40,080<br>and other parties that connect to the network.</p>
<p>66<br>00:02:40,080 –&gt; 00:02:43,240<br>So no matter what we do, whether it’s BGP or something else,</p>
<p>67<br>00:02:43,240 –&gt; 00:02:44,759<br>something has to actually reconcile</p>
<p>68<br>00:02:44,759 –&gt; 00:02:47,800<br>that there is no global agreement on what paths are good,</p>
<p>69<br>00:02:47,800 –&gt; 00:02:49,759<br>or even which paths should be made available</p>
<p>70<br>00:02:49,759 –&gt; 00:02:51,359<br>from one domain to another.</p>
<p>71<br>00:02:51,359 –&gt; 00:02:54,039<br>And so in that sense, BGP solving a very difficult problem,</p>
<p>72<br>00:02:54,039 –&gt; 00:02:55,879<br>and it is at least a viable solution to it.</p>
<p>73<br>00:02:55,879 –&gt; 00:02:58,759<br>And it’s been remarkably able to adapt over time</p>
<p>74<br>00:02:58,759 –&gt; 00:03:00,759<br>to address exactly the security,</p>
<p>75<br>00:03:00,759 –&gt; 00:03:04,000<br>scalability concerns, the concerns about business relationships</p>
<p>76<br>00:03:04,000 –&gt; 00:03:07,599<br>and even security concerns that have arisen as you’ve</p>
<p>77<br>00:03:07,599 –&gt; 00:03:10,199<br>tried to move the internet from a research network,</p>
<p>78<br>00:03:10,199 –&gt; 00:03:13,079<br>essentially a research experiment that escaped from the lab</p>
<p>79<br>00:03:13,079 –&gt; 00:03:16,879<br>into something that actually is a global commercial enterprise.</p>
<p>80<br>00:03:16,879 –&gt; 00:03:17,799<br>So that’s all good.</p>
<p>81<br>00:03:17,799 –&gt; 00:03:19,560<br>It has managed to weather the storm,</p>
<p>82<br>00:03:19,560 –&gt; 00:03:22,680<br>but it is hard to make scale.</p>
<p>83<br>00:03:22,680 –&gt; 00:03:23,960<br>It’s complex to configure.</p>
<p>84<br>00:03:23,960 –&gt; 00:03:26,800<br>In fact, the protocol itself is in some ways pretty simple.</p>
<p>85<br>00:03:26,800 –&gt; 00:03:28,640<br>I advertise paths to my neighbors.</p>
<p>86<br>00:03:28,640 –&gt; 00:03:30,960<br>They add themselves to the beginning of the path.</p>
<p>87<br>00:03:30,960 –&gt; 00:03:32,199<br>They pick the path they like best</p>
<p>88<br>00:03:32,199 –&gt; 00:03:34,159<br>and advertise it onward to their neighbors.</p>
<p>89<br>00:03:34,159 –&gt; 00:03:36,319<br>So it’s pretty simple, but all the action</p>
<p>90<br>00:03:36,319 –&gt; 00:03:38,199<br>is in how BGP is configured.</p>
<p>91<br>00:03:38,199 –&gt; 00:03:40,400<br>And that’s one of the reasons BGP is hard to teach,</p>
<p>92<br>00:03:40,400 –&gt; 00:03:41,960<br>because if you look at the protocol spec</p>
<p>93<br>00:03:41,960 –&gt; 00:03:45,680<br>or even a textbook about BGP, it mainly just captures that</p>
<p>94<br>00:03:45,680 –&gt; 00:03:49,240<br>hop by hop, path-based dissemination of routing information</p>
<p>95<br>00:03:49,240 –&gt; 00:03:52,120<br>and says very little about how configuration is done.</p>
<p>96<br>00:03:52,120 –&gt; 00:03:53,800<br>So it’s a pretty steep learning curve.</p>
<p>97<br>00:03:53,800 –&gt; 00:03:57,960<br>People make mistakes and configuring BGP out of Naivete</p>
<p>98<br>00:03:57,960 –&gt; 00:04:01,640<br>and out of fairly low-level group configuration mechanisms</p>
<p>99<br>00:04:01,640 –&gt; 00:04:02,360<br>and the routers.</p>
<p>100<br>00:04:02,360 –&gt; 00:04:06,840<br>And so we see lots of outages just caused by operator error.</p>
<p>101<br>00:04:06,840 –&gt; 00:04:09,680<br>A really good example was a number of years ago.</p>
<p>102<br>00:04:09,680 –&gt; 00:04:12,840<br>Pakistan Telecom was trying to block access to YouTube</p>
<p>103<br>00:04:12,840 –&gt; 00:04:15,200<br>within Pakistan and accidentally blocked it</p>
<p>104<br>00:04:15,200 –&gt; 00:04:18,759<br>for the entire world by announcing that they were the best way</p>
<p>105<br>00:04:18,759 –&gt; 00:04:20,399<br>to reach YouTube.</p>
<p>106<br>00:04:20,399 –&gt; 00:04:22,360<br>And everybody on the internet believed it.</p>
<p>107<br>00:04:22,360 –&gt; 00:04:24,759<br>So BGP is definitely vulnerable to these sort of butterfly</p>
<p>108<br>00:04:24,759 –&gt; 00:04:27,879<br>effects, where a small failure or a small configuration</p>
<p>109<br>00:04:27,879 –&gt; 00:04:29,199<br>mistake in one part of the internet</p>
<p>110<br>00:04:29,199 –&gt; 00:04:31,959<br>can have these pretty significant global consequences</p>
<p>111<br>00:04:31,959 –&gt; 00:04:33,680<br>to the extent that people might not be</p>
<p>112<br>00:04:33,680 –&gt; 00:04:35,639<br>able to watch videos of cats flushing toilets</p>
<p>113<br>00:04:35,639 –&gt; 00:04:38,120<br>for multiple hours at a time.</p>
<p>114<br>00:04:38,120 –&gt; 00:04:40,920<br>So from that point of view, it wasn’t really designed</p>
<p>115<br>00:04:40,920 –&gt; 00:04:44,399<br>to be a robust and secure protocol that one might want</p>
<p>116<br>00:04:44,399 –&gt; 00:04:48,480<br>for a critical infrastructure like the internet is become.</p>
<p>117<br>00:04:49,000 –&gt; 00:04:52,720<br>We always hear stories of attackers being</p>
<p>118<br>00:04:52,720 –&gt; 00:04:55,520<br>able to sort of surreptitiously advertise a route,</p>
<p>119<br>00:04:55,520 –&gt; 00:04:59,280<br>or there’s the potential for it through a BGP hearing session</p>
<p>120<br>00:04:59,280 –&gt; 00:05:03,840<br>and therefore be able to subvert the routing that takes place.</p>
<p>121<br>00:05:03,840 –&gt; 00:05:05,680<br>Do you think that this happens a lot in practice?</p>
<p>122<br>00:05:05,680 –&gt; 00:05:08,280<br>This is a common way to attack the network?</p>
<p>123<br>00:05:08,280 –&gt; 00:05:11,120<br>So I think in practice a lot of the bad guys on the internet</p>
<p>124<br>00:05:11,120 –&gt; 00:05:13,080<br>actually want the internet to stay up,</p>
<p>125<br>00:05:13,080 –&gt; 00:05:14,480<br>because what they’re actually trying to do</p>
<p>126<br>00:05:14,480 –&gt; 00:05:16,280<br>is either launch a denial of service attack</p>
<p>127<br>00:05:16,280 –&gt; 00:05:18,439<br>on a particular victim or to do a fishing</p>
<p>128<br>00:05:18,879 –&gt; 00:05:19,879<br>attack.</p>
<p>129<br>00:05:19,879 –&gt; 00:05:21,399<br>So I think in general most of the bad guys don’t want the</p>
<p>130<br>00:05:21,399 –&gt; 00:05:23,800<br>don’t want BGP to go down.</p>
<p>131<br>00:05:23,800 –&gt; 00:05:26,600<br>A second reason it might not happen a lot is that</p>
<p>132<br>00:05:26,600 –&gt; 00:05:29,839<br>adversaries often don’t have access to a BGP speaking router</p>
<p>133<br>00:05:29,839 –&gt; 00:05:32,279<br>of their own to be able to manipulate or just don’t have</p>
<p>134<br>00:05:32,279 –&gt; 00:05:33,800<br>the skill set to do it.</p>
<p>135<br>00:05:33,800 –&gt; 00:05:35,639<br>So I would certainly say it’s not as prevalent</p>
<p>136<br>00:05:35,639 –&gt; 00:05:38,480<br>as some of the other forms of cyber attacks we see</p>
<p>137<br>00:05:38,480 –&gt; 00:05:39,399<br>on the internet.</p>
<p>138<br>00:05:39,399 –&gt; 00:05:41,959<br>That said, we see several times a year of very high profile</p>
<p>139<br>00:05:41,959 –&gt; 00:05:45,959<br>outages caused sometimes by operator error, sometimes in</p>
<p>140<br>00:05:45,959 –&gt; 00:05:48,079<br>sometimes in ways where it may not be clear if it’s actually</p>
<p>141<br>00:05:48,079 –&gt; 00:05:49,680<br>intentional or an accident.</p>
<p>142<br>00:05:49,680 –&gt; 00:05:51,120<br>So it’s certainly a huge vulnerability.</p>
<p>143<br>00:05:51,120 –&gt; 00:05:54,839<br>And when it does fail can have much more global consequences</p>
<p>144<br>00:05:54,839 –&gt; 00:05:56,639<br>than an attack on a single victim might.</p>
<p>145<br>00:05:56,639 –&gt; 00:05:57,639<br>Yes.</p>
<p>146<br>00:05:57,639 –&gt; 00:05:59,560<br>So I think it’s still a big security concern,</p>
<p>147<br>00:05:59,560 –&gt; 00:06:02,639<br>but arguably it’s not as prevalent as some of the more</p>
<p>148<br>00:06:02,639 –&gt; 00:06:04,919<br>targeted forms of attack we see on end hosts.</p>
<p>149<br>00:06:04,919 –&gt; 00:06:06,079<br>Right.</p>
<p>150<br>00:06:06,079 –&gt; 00:06:09,639<br>So one of the limitations that’s often cited of the way</p>
<p>151<br>00:06:09,639 –&gt; 00:06:13,639<br>that the path vector is transmitted or advertised to neighbors</p>
<p>152<br>00:06:13,639 –&gt; 00:06:17,680<br>is that of course when someone when a peer</p>
<p>153<br>00:06:17,680 –&gt; 00:06:20,599<br>advertises a path to me, I don’t know whether they’re</p>
<p>154<br>00:06:20,599 –&gt; 00:06:22,959<br>actually going to follow that path.</p>
<p>155<br>00:06:22,959 –&gt; 00:06:25,279<br>The second thing is they’re choosing amongst the many paths</p>
<p>156<br>00:06:25,279 –&gt; 00:06:28,959<br>that they can advertise to me, which one they want to</p>
<p>157<br>00:06:28,959 –&gt; 00:06:29,680<br>advertise to me.</p>
<p>158<br>00:06:29,680 –&gt; 00:06:31,759<br>And so there may be alternatives that I would prefer</p>
<p>159<br>00:06:31,759 –&gt; 00:06:33,719<br>that they don’t even tell me about.</p>
<p>160<br>00:06:33,719 –&gt; 00:06:38,399<br>So is this a big limitation in practice?</p>
<p>161<br>00:06:38,399 –&gt; 00:06:42,199<br>Or is this just the concern of the sort of the academicians?</p>
<p>162<br>00:06:42,199 –&gt; 00:06:44,240<br>I think it’s some mode of a concern in practice</p>
<p>163<br>00:06:44,240 –&gt; 00:06:47,719<br>in that it may very well be that a customer of an ISP</p>
<p>164<br>00:06:47,719 –&gt; 00:06:50,199<br>would like to pick a path that avoids a particular country</p>
<p>165<br>00:06:50,199 –&gt; 00:06:52,519<br>that might do wiretapping or censorship.</p>
<p>166<br>00:06:52,519 –&gt; 00:06:54,680<br>There’s a really good example where you may want to pick paths</p>
<p>167<br>00:06:54,680 –&gt; 00:06:57,120<br>that avoid a particular intermediate domain.</p>
<p>168<br>00:06:57,120 –&gt; 00:06:59,839<br>And they’re not able to do so because maybe all of your providers</p>
<p>169<br>00:06:59,839 –&gt; 00:07:02,240<br>have neglected to offer you such a path,</p>
<p>170<br>00:07:02,240 –&gt; 00:07:03,319<br>even though there might be one that</p>
<p>171<br>00:07:03,319 –&gt; 00:07:05,079<br>exists on the actual graph.</p>
<p>172<br>00:07:05,079 –&gt; 00:07:07,039<br>And there can also be cases because routing decisions</p>
<p>173<br>00:07:07,039 –&gt; 00:07:10,240<br>aren’t based on performance that there might be a path</p>
<p>174<br>00:07:10,240 –&gt; 00:07:12,199<br>with really good performance that’s actually available</p>
<p>175<br>00:07:12,199 –&gt; 00:07:14,079<br>on the graph that you don’t see.</p>
<p>176<br>00:07:14,079 –&gt; 00:07:15,560<br>I mean, a really good example when the Middle East</p>
<p>177<br>00:07:15,560 –&gt; 00:07:19,240<br>Fibercut happened in the Mediterranean a number of years ago,</p>
<p>178<br>00:07:19,240 –&gt; 00:07:22,720<br>a lot of people started routing the other way around the globe.</p>
<p>179<br>00:07:22,720 –&gt; 00:07:24,240<br>And I heard from this from a number of carriers</p>
<p>180<br>00:07:24,240 –&gt; 00:07:26,600<br>where they, you know, it wasn’t that there weren’t routes</p>
<p>181<br>00:07:26,600 –&gt; 00:07:28,040<br>available, but because the routes they</p>
<p>182<br>00:07:28,040 –&gt; 00:07:30,000<br>happened to learn were much more restricted.</p>
<p>183<br>00:07:30,000 –&gt; 00:07:32,199<br>There were also, there were forced to take traffic</p>
<p>184<br>00:07:32,199 –&gt; 00:07:34,160<br>on a path the other way around the globe, sometimes</p>
<p>185<br>00:07:34,160 –&gt; 00:07:35,480<br>with much higher latency.</p>
<p>186<br>00:07:35,480 –&gt; 00:07:36,280<br>I see.</p>
<p>187<br>00:07:36,280 –&gt; 00:07:37,280<br>I see.</p>
<p>188<br>00:07:37,280 –&gt; 00:07:38,280<br>I see.</p>
<p>189<br>00:07:38,280 –&gt; 00:07:40,120<br>So I do think those things matter.</p>
<p>190<br>00:07:40,199 –&gt; 00:07:44,160<br>But I think it’s quite fair that if you have multiple providers,</p>
<p>191<br>00:07:44,160 –&gt; 00:07:45,560<br>you may get one path from each of them</p>
<p>192<br>00:07:45,560 –&gt; 00:07:47,759<br>and still get some of that same path diversity</p>
<p>193<br>00:07:47,759 –&gt; 00:07:51,519<br>that you might wish you could get from one provider.</p>
<p>194<br>00:07:51,519 –&gt; 00:07:53,680<br>Do you think it’s common for a path that’s</p>
<p>195<br>00:07:53,680 –&gt; 00:07:56,399<br>advertised to me to be then different from the one</p>
<p>196<br>00:07:56,399 –&gt; 00:07:59,639<br>that the advertiser uses in practice?</p>
<p>197<br>00:07:59,639 –&gt; 00:08:02,280<br>In other words, they advertise one path to me.</p>
<p>198<br>00:08:02,280 –&gt; 00:08:05,240<br>Like that path, it fits with my local policy.</p>
<p>199<br>00:08:05,240 –&gt; 00:08:07,759<br>And then they actually use a different one in practice.</p>
<p>200<br>00:08:07,759 –&gt; 00:08:08,800<br>Yeah, that can certainly happen.</p>
<p>201<br>00:08:08,800 –&gt; 00:08:10,680<br>And it can happen for legitimate reasons.</p>
<p>202<br>00:08:10,680 –&gt; 00:08:12,920<br>For example, route aggregation, where I might be riding</p>
<p>203<br>00:08:12,920 –&gt; 00:08:15,439<br>through in a very coarse grain, big address block.</p>
<p>204<br>00:08:15,439 –&gt; 00:08:17,560<br>And inside the provider’s domain, they’ve</p>
<p>205<br>00:08:17,560 –&gt; 00:08:20,000<br>broken that into a much larger number of smaller address</p>
<p>206<br>00:08:20,000 –&gt; 00:08:21,720<br>blocks that have different paths.</p>
<p>207<br>00:08:21,720 –&gt; 00:08:23,920<br>So in some cases, it might just naturally happen</p>
<p>208<br>00:08:23,920 –&gt; 00:08:26,879<br>because of the scalability mechanisms in the protocol.</p>
<p>209<br>00:08:26,879 –&gt; 00:08:29,720<br>And you can certainly imagine less benign</p>
<p>210<br>00:08:29,720 –&gt; 00:08:32,560<br>reasons where that might happen, where a path might be</p>
<p>211<br>00:08:32,560 –&gt; 00:08:35,399<br>advertised to me because I’ll be more likely to pick it.</p>
<p>212<br>00:08:35,399 –&gt; 00:08:37,240<br>And some of them might be trying to attract my traffic</p>
<p>213<br>00:08:37,240 –&gt; 00:08:38,480<br>into their network.</p>
<p>214<br>00:08:38,480 –&gt; 00:08:40,600<br>And then send the traffic on the path that’s actually</p>
<p>215<br>00:08:40,600 –&gt; 00:08:42,600<br>most financially advantageous for them.</p>
<p>216<br>00:08:42,600 –&gt; 00:08:44,320<br>And it’s been some very nice research work showing</p>
<p>217<br>00:08:44,320 –&gt; 00:08:47,080<br>that those kind of gaming mechanisms are possible.</p>
<p>218<br>00:08:47,080 –&gt; 00:08:48,680<br>And I think what’s particularly interesting about that</p>
<p>219<br>00:08:48,680 –&gt; 00:08:52,279<br>intellectually is that even the best security extensions</p>
<p>220<br>00:08:52,279 –&gt; 00:08:55,680<br>to BGP, which are not deployed at all today, don’t prevent</p>
<p>221<br>00:08:55,680 –&gt; 00:08:59,519<br>that because they mainly secure that BGP messages themselves</p>
<p>222<br>00:08:59,519 –&gt; 00:09:02,120<br>really did go through the sequence of autonomous systems</p>
<p>223<br>00:09:02,120 –&gt; 00:09:03,920<br>that are listed in the AS path.</p>
<p>224<br>00:09:03,920 –&gt; 00:09:06,039<br>But all bets are off when you send the packets</p>
<p>225<br>00:09:06,039 –&gt; 00:09:06,720<br>on the data plan.</p>
<p>226<br>00:09:06,720 –&gt; 00:09:08,960<br>It’s really very little stopping a domain</p>
<p>227<br>00:09:08,960 –&gt; 00:09:12,160<br>from installing a different entry and affording table</p>
<p>228<br>00:09:12,160 –&gt; 00:09:14,480<br>that will send my packets a completely different way.</p>
<p>229<br>00:09:14,480 –&gt; 00:09:16,800<br>So it makes it difficult to do something like,</p>
<p>230<br>00:09:16,800 –&gt; 00:09:18,840<br>let’s suppose a government says, I only</p>
<p>231<br>00:09:18,840 –&gt; 00:09:21,000<br>want my traffic to traverse networks that</p>
<p>232<br>00:09:21,000 –&gt; 00:09:22,440<br>are in my own country.</p>
<p>233<br>00:09:22,440 –&gt; 00:09:24,480<br>Or I want to avoid another country.</p>
<p>234<br>00:09:24,480 –&gt; 00:09:27,120<br>Even though BGP will let you pick paths based on what</p>
<p>235<br>00:09:27,120 –&gt; 00:09:29,800<br>autonomous systems are there, if you really care</p>
<p>236<br>00:09:29,800 –&gt; 00:09:31,440<br>to make sure that property holds,</p>
<p>237<br>00:09:31,440 –&gt; 00:09:34,440<br>you may not really be able to count on BGP to give that to you.</p>
<p>238<br>00:09:34,440 –&gt; 00:09:35,720<br>I see.</p>
<p>239<br>00:09:35,720 –&gt; 00:09:38,879<br>So another often cited problem with BGP</p>
<p>240<br>00:09:38,879 –&gt; 00:09:41,279<br>is the rate that it converges after there’s</p>
<p>241<br>00:09:41,279 –&gt; 00:09:42,200<br>been a routing change.</p>
<p>242<br>00:09:42,200 –&gt; 00:09:45,160<br>And I know that you were very involved in work a number of years</p>
<p>243<br>00:09:45,160 –&gt; 00:09:47,320<br>ago in both uncovering the problem</p>
<p>244<br>00:09:47,320 –&gt; 00:09:50,240<br>and then looking for ways to looking</p>
<p>245<br>00:09:50,240 –&gt; 00:09:51,519<br>ways to solve it.</p>
<p>246<br>00:09:51,519 –&gt; 00:09:54,360<br>Can you give us a brief overview of the problem,</p>
<p>247<br>00:09:54,360 –&gt; 00:09:57,759<br>how it was found, and then how things stand today?</p>
<p>248<br>00:09:57,759 –&gt; 00:09:58,399<br>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>249<br>00:09:58,399 –&gt; 00:10:00,800<br>So there are two issues with BGP and convergence.</p>
<p>250<br>00:10:00,800 –&gt; 00:10:04,120<br>One is whether the system converges at all.</p>
<p>251<br>00:10:04,120 –&gt; 00:10:06,679<br>In other words, is it possible that all of these domains</p>
<p>252<br>00:10:06,679 –&gt; 00:10:08,560<br>making their own local choices about which way</p>
<p>253<br>00:10:08,560 –&gt; 00:10:10,720<br>they want to send their traffic, each</p>
<p>254<br>00:10:10,720 –&gt; 00:10:13,080<br>continue to convince each other to change their minds about which</p>
<p>255<br>00:10:13,080 –&gt; 00:10:15,600<br>way to go and never reach a global agreement?</p>
<p>256<br>00:10:15,600 –&gt; 00:10:17,960<br>And the second is even if they do reach global agreement,</p>
<p>257<br>00:10:17,960 –&gt; 00:10:19,799<br>how quickly does that happen?</p>
<p>258<br>00:10:19,799 –&gt; 00:10:22,120<br>And while that transition is happening,</p>
<p>259<br>00:10:22,120 –&gt; 00:10:24,840<br>packets are being lost in flight, put in loops, delivered</p>
<p>260<br>00:10:24,840 –&gt; 00:10:29,320<br>out of order, people have found that when Skype calls are disrupted</p>
<p>261<br>00:10:29,320 –&gt; 00:10:31,560<br>or perhaps Google Hangouts as well,</p>
<p>262<br>00:10:31,559 –&gt; 00:10:34,959<br>that it’s most likely caused by this BGP convergence</p>
<p>263<br>00:10:34,959 –&gt; 00:10:37,079<br>behavior rather than by network congestion.</p>
<p>264<br>00:10:37,079 –&gt; 00:10:37,879<br>So both are issues.</p>
<p>265<br>00:10:37,879 –&gt; 00:10:39,119<br>Do you converge?</p>
<p>266<br>00:10:39,119 –&gt; 00:10:40,639<br>And if so, how quickly?</p>
<p>267<br>00:10:40,639 –&gt; 00:10:43,319<br>So on the first question, it is certainly possible</p>
<p>268<br>00:10:43,319 –&gt; 00:10:44,799<br>that I want to route through you.</p>
<p>269<br>00:10:44,799 –&gt; 00:10:45,959<br>You want to route through someone else,</p>
<p>270<br>00:10:45,959 –&gt; 00:10:47,359<br>and they want to route through me.</p>
<p>271<br>00:10:47,359 –&gt; 00:10:49,399<br>And we each cause each other to change our minds.</p>
<p>272<br>00:10:49,399 –&gt; 00:10:51,239<br>Once I decide to route through you,</p>
<p>273<br>00:10:51,239 –&gt; 00:10:53,039<br>the third party no longer has available.</p>
<p>274<br>00:10:53,039 –&gt; 00:10:54,959<br>They route they might have wanted through me</p>
<p>275<br>00:10:54,959 –&gt; 00:10:57,079<br>and like you might as well.</p>
<p>276<br>00:10:57,079 –&gt; 00:10:59,079<br>And we continue to chase our tails.</p>
<p>277<br>00:10:59,360 –&gt; 00:11:02,520<br>In practice, that’s thought not to happen very often.</p>
<p>278<br>00:11:02,520 –&gt; 00:11:05,200<br>And the reason for that is that BGP is first and foremost</p>
<p>279<br>00:11:05,200 –&gt; 00:11:08,800<br>the money route in protocol, not a packet route in protocol.</p>
<p>280<br>00:11:08,800 –&gt; 00:11:11,320<br>Running a packet is kind of a nice side effect.</p>
<p>281<br>00:11:11,320 –&gt; 00:11:13,680<br>And so when I pick a route as an AS,</p>
<p>282<br>00:11:13,680 –&gt; 00:11:16,600<br>I’m picking based on economic factors,</p>
<p>283<br>00:11:16,600 –&gt; 00:11:18,240<br>do I have to pay to send traffic through you</p>
<p>284<br>00:11:18,240 –&gt; 00:11:19,639<br>because you’re my provider?</p>
<p>285<br>00:11:19,639 –&gt; 00:11:22,200<br>Do I get revenue from you when I send traffic through you</p>
<p>286<br>00:11:22,200 –&gt; 00:11:23,480<br>because you’re my customer?</p>
<p>287<br>00:11:23,480 –&gt; 00:11:26,480<br>Or is it sort of financially neutral because you’re my peer?</p>
<p>288<br>00:11:26,519 –&gt; 00:11:28,879<br>And so in the end, these sort of protocol</p>
<p>289<br>00:11:28,879 –&gt; 00:11:30,920<br>oscillations that are permanent suggest</p>
<p>290<br>00:11:30,920 –&gt; 00:11:33,240<br>some sort of weird financial dynamic taking place</p>
<p>291<br>00:11:33,240 –&gt; 00:11:35,800<br>where everybody’s somehow making money in a cycle.</p>
<p>292<br>00:11:35,800 –&gt; 00:11:37,440<br>And it doesn’t really make a lot of sense</p>
<p>293<br>00:11:37,440 –&gt; 00:11:39,519<br>that everybody would somehow have it</p>
<p>294<br>00:11:39,519 –&gt; 00:11:41,800<br>in their financial best interest to pick routes</p>
<p>295<br>00:11:41,800 –&gt; 00:11:43,800<br>that ultimately cycle back.</p>
<p>296<br>00:11:43,800 –&gt; 00:11:46,560<br>So it’s not that we think this doesn’t actually happen.</p>
<p>297<br>00:11:46,560 –&gt; 00:11:48,080<br>And some of the work I was involved in</p>
<p>298<br>00:11:48,080 –&gt; 00:11:50,560<br>tried to come up with a sort of an economic model</p>
<p>299<br>00:11:50,560 –&gt; 00:11:53,560<br>and proofs that under certain conditions it can’t happen.</p>
<p>300<br>00:11:53,560 –&gt; 00:11:56,200<br>Now, that said, we do sometimes when I was at AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>301<br>00:11:56,200 –&gt; 00:11:58,879<br>we see route oscillation within an autonomous system</p>
<p>302<br>00:11:58,879 –&gt; 00:12:00,480<br>because BGP is used there as well</p>
<p>303<br>00:12:00,480 –&gt; 00:12:03,680<br>to disseminate writing information within a domain.</p>
<p>304<br>00:12:03,680 –&gt; 00:12:05,280<br>So it’s not that the problem never happens</p>
<p>305<br>00:12:05,280 –&gt; 00:12:08,000<br>but it is somewhat of a rare pathological problem</p>
<p>306<br>00:12:08,000 –&gt; 00:12:11,000<br>other than something that seems to happen a lot.</p>
<p>307<br>00:12:11,000 –&gt; 00:12:14,000<br>On the second question about how quickly do things converge?</p>
<p>308<br>00:12:14,000 –&gt; 00:12:15,800<br>A number of years ago, BGP would converge</p>
<p>309<br>00:12:15,800 –&gt; 00:12:18,640<br>in the order of minutes or even several minutes.</p>
<p>310<br>00:12:18,640 –&gt; 00:12:22,320<br>Definitely quite long relative to sort of the 50 milliseconds</p>
<p>311<br>00:12:22,320 –&gt; 00:12:25,520<br>or less target that a lot of real-time applications need.</p>
<p>312<br>00:12:25,519 –&gt; 00:12:28,559<br>And part of that is that BGP keeps exploring alternate paths</p>
<p>313<br>00:12:28,559 –&gt; 00:12:29,720<br>one after another.</p>
<p>314<br>00:12:29,720 –&gt; 00:12:32,480<br>So if the path I’m using is withdrawn from me,</p>
<p>315<br>00:12:32,480 –&gt; 00:12:36,039<br>I explore my next most preferred path, which may in fact</p>
<p>316<br>00:12:36,039 –&gt; 00:12:38,720<br>share the same fate as the path I just lost.</p>
<p>317<br>00:12:38,720 –&gt; 00:12:40,399<br>It may have a link in common.</p>
<p>318<br>00:12:40,399 –&gt; 00:12:42,279<br>BGP is just advertising the whole path</p>
<p>319<br>00:12:42,279 –&gt; 00:12:43,759<br>that doesn’t tell you any information</p>
<p>320<br>00:12:43,759 –&gt; 00:12:47,319<br>about shared resources that might affect many, many paths.</p>
<p>321<br>00:12:47,319 –&gt; 00:12:49,240<br>And so one after the other, I explore them</p>
<p>322<br>00:12:49,240 –&gt; 00:12:51,079<br>and my neighbors are doing the same.</p>
<p>323<br>00:12:51,079 –&gt; 00:12:54,600<br>And you can end up with sort of an exponential iterative process</p>
<p>324<br>00:12:54,600 –&gt; 00:12:56,040<br>of exploring those paths.</p>
<p>325<br>00:12:56,040 –&gt; 00:13:00,360<br>So that’s gotten better because the sort of timers, the drive,</p>
<p>326<br>00:13:00,360 –&gt; 00:13:02,360<br>how quickly I can move from one decision</p>
<p>327<br>00:13:02,360 –&gt; 00:13:05,279<br>to the next of shrunk over the years.</p>
<p>328<br>00:13:05,279 –&gt; 00:13:07,560<br>And frankly, when we, even a number of years ago,</p>
<p>329<br>00:13:07,560 –&gt; 00:13:09,800<br>when we looked at this, most of the BGP routes</p>
<p>330<br>00:13:09,800 –&gt; 00:13:11,519<br>are remarkably stable.</p>
<p>331<br>00:13:11,519 –&gt; 00:13:13,399<br>10 days or two weeks at a time.</p>
<p>332<br>00:13:13,399 –&gt; 00:13:15,840<br>There’s a small number of unstable destinations</p>
<p>333<br>00:13:15,840 –&gt; 00:13:18,000<br>on the internet that go up and down quite a lot.</p>
<p>334<br>00:13:18,000 –&gt; 00:13:21,360<br>And that’s thought to be caused not by routing oscillation</p>
<p>335<br>00:13:21,360 –&gt; 00:13:23,960<br>but by literally equipment going up or down.</p>
<p>336<br>00:13:23,960 –&gt; 00:13:26,440<br>That might cause a destination to be reachable or unreachable</p>
<p>337<br>00:13:26,440 –&gt; 00:13:27,800<br>back and forth.</p>
<p>338<br>00:13:27,800 –&gt; 00:13:31,280<br>And in practice, those destinations are extremely unpopular.</p>
<p>339<br>00:13:31,280 –&gt; 00:13:33,560<br>Now, they’re either unpopular because you can’t reach them</p>
<p>340<br>00:13:33,560 –&gt; 00:13:34,600<br>in the first place.</p>
<p>341<br>00:13:34,600 –&gt; 00:13:36,320<br>That’s not much traffic going on.</p>
<p>342<br>00:13:36,320 –&gt; 00:13:37,759<br>Or they’re popular.</p>
<p>343<br>00:13:37,759 –&gt; 00:13:39,759<br>And because they’re unpopular, nobody cares enough</p>
<p>344<br>00:13:39,759 –&gt; 00:13:42,920<br>to make sure the network around them is stable.</p>
<p>345<br>00:13:42,920 –&gt; 00:13:44,519<br>But what that all means when you put it together</p>
<p>346<br>00:13:44,519 –&gt; 00:13:46,840<br>is that the vast majority of the traffic on the internet</p>
<p>347<br>00:13:46,840 –&gt; 00:13:49,639<br>is going over paths that are often stable for days</p>
<p>348<br>00:13:49,639 –&gt; 00:13:51,920<br>or even a week or two at a time.</p>
<p>349<br>00:13:51,919 –&gt; 00:13:54,519<br>But in some sense, between a lot of research,</p>
<p>350<br>00:13:54,519 –&gt; 00:13:57,159<br>a lot of improvements in software and routers</p>
<p>351<br>00:13:57,159 –&gt; 00:13:59,279<br>and improvements in operational practices</p>
<p>352<br>00:13:59,279 –&gt; 00:14:01,959<br>have meant that BGP convergence while it still matters</p>
<p>353<br>00:14:01,959 –&gt; 00:14:04,399<br>is nowhere near as messy a problem as it might</p>
<p>354<br>00:14:04,399 –&gt; 00:14:06,839<br>have seemed like 15 years ago.</p>
<p>355<br>00:14:06,839 –&gt; 00:14:08,839<br>Yeah, OK.</p>
<p>356<br>00:14:08,839 –&gt; 00:14:10,159<br>One of the things you mentioned earlier</p>
<p>357<br>00:14:10,159 –&gt; 00:14:13,679<br>is that one of the things that makes it hard to teach BGP</p>
<p>358<br>00:14:13,679 –&gt; 00:14:16,079<br>or it makes it hard as a student to really understand</p>
<p>359<br>00:14:16,079 –&gt; 00:14:18,879<br>what problem BGP is trying to solve is, in some ways,</p>
<p>360<br>00:14:18,879 –&gt; 00:14:21,480<br>it doesn’t feel like it’s built on the same principle</p>
<p>361<br>00:14:21,480 –&gt; 00:14:25,159<br>algorithms that RIP was originally an OSPF</p>
<p>362<br>00:14:25,159 –&gt; 00:14:28,120<br>as just a collection of policy mechanisms</p>
<p>363<br>00:14:28,120 –&gt; 00:14:30,000<br>and then path routing.</p>
<p>364<br>00:14:30,000 –&gt; 00:14:35,159<br>And so if you look at BGP today,</p>
<p>365<br>00:14:35,159 –&gt; 00:14:38,120<br>is it a band-aid that’s lived for a long time?</p>
<p>366<br>00:14:38,120 –&gt; 00:14:42,039<br>Is it something that you believe and hope will be around</p>
<p>367<br>00:14:42,039 –&gt; 00:14:43,440<br>as an internet-domain routing protocol</p>
<p>368<br>00:14:43,440 –&gt; 00:14:44,600<br>for a long time in the future?</p>
<p>369<br>00:14:44,600 –&gt; 00:14:46,960<br>Or if you’ve got to play God for a minute</p>
<p>370<br>00:14:46,960 –&gt; 00:14:51,159<br>and wipe away BGP and replace it with a new internet-domain</p>
<p>371<br>00:14:51,159 –&gt; 00:14:53,639<br>routing system, what would you do?</p>
<p>372<br>00:14:53,639 –&gt; 00:14:55,559<br>Would you replace it with something</p>
<p>373<br>00:14:55,559 –&gt; 00:14:57,519<br>that’s similar or quite different?</p>
<p>374<br>00:14:57,519 –&gt; 00:14:58,360<br>That’s a great question.</p>
<p>375<br>00:14:58,360 –&gt; 00:15:01,360<br>So I’ve BGP is the protocol I love to hate.</p>
<p>376<br>00:15:01,360 –&gt; 00:15:03,480<br>So in some sense, it has proven quite</p>
<p>377<br>00:15:03,480 –&gt; 00:15:05,879<br>evolveable and it has changed dramatically over the years.</p>
<p>378<br>00:15:05,879 –&gt; 00:15:08,279<br>So a Yaka Brechtur and a talkie-given number of years</p>
<p>379<br>00:15:08,279 –&gt; 00:15:10,399<br>ago called BGP, the triple napkin protocol</p>
<p>380<br>00:15:10,399 –&gt; 00:15:13,519<br>for the three napkins in which the protocol was</p>
<p>381<br>00:15:13,519 –&gt; 00:15:15,319<br>described when it was first designed.</p>
<p>382<br>00:15:15,319 –&gt; 00:15:17,919<br>And I would say it’s now the kitchen sink protocol</p>
<p>383<br>00:15:17,919 –&gt; 00:15:20,480<br>in that the number of steps in its decision process,</p>
<p>384<br>00:15:20,480 –&gt; 00:15:22,480<br>the number of attributes, pastoral,</p>
<p>385<br>00:15:22,480 –&gt; 00:15:23,879<br>the number of different kinds of things</p>
<p>386<br>00:15:23,879 –&gt; 00:15:25,960<br>that can be addressed in BGP, all of these things</p>
<p>387<br>00:15:25,960 –&gt; 00:15:28,519<br>have gotten more and more and more complicated.</p>
<p>388<br>00:15:28,519 –&gt; 00:15:31,240<br>And in part, that’s a success disaster.</p>
<p>389<br>00:15:31,240 –&gt; 00:15:34,720<br>It’s possible to do a lot of things with BGP</p>
<p>390<br>00:15:34,720 –&gt; 00:15:37,080<br>that were far beyond what it was originally designed to do.</p>
<p>391<br>00:15:37,080 –&gt; 00:15:38,279<br>And so it is a testament to how</p>
<p>392<br>00:15:38,279 –&gt; 00:15:41,519<br>available it is that it has been evolving in this way.</p>
<p>393<br>00:15:41,519 –&gt; 00:15:43,440<br>But it means that it’s just so complicated</p>
<p>394<br>00:15:43,440 –&gt; 00:15:45,279<br>and so difficult to configure.</p>
<p>395<br>00:15:45,279 –&gt; 00:15:49,480<br>And also very insecure because when it is originally designed,</p>
<p>396<br>00:15:49,480 –&gt; 00:15:51,800<br>there were no mechanisms for signing and verifying</p>
<p>397<br>00:15:51,800 –&gt; 00:15:55,360<br>of the routing information and no reliable registries</p>
<p>398<br>00:15:55,360 –&gt; 00:15:57,080<br>of which autonomous systems are allowed</p>
<p>399<br>00:15:57,080 –&gt; 00:15:59,879<br>to originate information for a particular address prompt.</p>
<p>400<br>00:15:59,879 –&gt; 00:16:02,000<br>And so now we’re trying to put the catback in the bag,</p>
<p>401<br>00:16:02,000 –&gt; 00:16:04,720<br>if you will, by putting a lot of that security</p>
<p>402<br>00:16:04,720 –&gt; 00:16:05,639<br>infrastructure together.</p>
<p>403<br>00:16:05,639 –&gt; 00:16:09,080<br>And it’s actually quite difficult to do after the fact.</p>
<p>404<br>00:16:09,080 –&gt; 00:16:11,080<br>So in that sense, BGP is kind of a volatile place</p>
<p>405<br>00:16:11,080 –&gt; 00:16:13,200<br>where it’s fairly unwieldy.</p>
<p>406<br>00:16:13,200 –&gt; 00:16:15,440<br>That said, if you replace BGP, you still</p>
<p>407<br>00:16:15,440 –&gt; 00:16:18,240<br>have to reconcile the fact that different domains</p>
<p>408<br>00:16:18,240 –&gt; 00:16:22,240<br>have different autonomy and have different priorities</p>
<p>409<br>00:16:22,240 –&gt; 00:16:24,360<br>for how they want their traffic to be handled.</p>
<p>410<br>00:16:24,360 –&gt; 00:16:26,879<br>So one thing that I’m really interested in along those lines</p>
<p>411<br>00:16:26,879 –&gt; 00:16:30,639<br>is that it seems weird to me that the economic relationships</p>
<p>412<br>00:16:30,639 –&gt; 00:16:33,000<br>between domains place out at the time scale</p>
<p>413<br>00:16:33,000 –&gt; 00:16:35,600<br>of individual packets or routing protocol messages.</p>
<p>414<br>00:16:35,600 –&gt; 00:16:38,560<br>That’s a pretty small time scale for economic concerns</p>
<p>415<br>00:16:38,560 –&gt; 00:16:39,680<br>to play out.</p>
<p>416<br>00:16:39,680 –&gt; 00:16:42,320<br>And if you look at what’s happened in servers,</p>
<p>417<br>00:16:42,320 –&gt; 00:16:44,799<br>virtualization is made possible to really separate</p>
<p>418<br>00:16:44,799 –&gt; 00:16:47,680<br>the owner of an infrastructure from the party that’s actually</p>
<p>419<br>00:16:47,679 –&gt; 00:16:49,919<br>running an application on top of that infrastructure,</p>
<p>420<br>00:16:49,919 –&gt; 00:16:52,239<br>a virtual machine that might belong to a tenant,</p>
<p>421<br>00:16:52,239 –&gt; 00:16:54,479<br>running on a server that might belong to a company</p>
<p>422<br>00:16:54,479 –&gt; 00:16:56,799<br>like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon.</p>
<p>423<br>00:16:56,799 –&gt; 00:16:58,120<br>And so I’m intrigued by the idea</p>
<p>424<br>00:16:58,120 –&gt; 00:17:01,279<br>that we can now virtualize networks as well.</p>
<p>425<br>00:17:01,279 –&gt; 00:17:04,039<br>And you’ve obviously worked on that I have too.</p>
<p>426<br>00:17:04,039 –&gt; 00:17:07,759<br>It’d be nice if I could instead have a virtual network that</p>
<p>427<br>00:17:07,759 –&gt; 00:17:11,279<br>spans the equipment owned and managed by multiple parties</p>
<p>428<br>00:17:11,279 –&gt; 00:17:15,079<br>and then control my own fate on top of that virtual topology.</p>
<p>429<br>00:17:15,079 –&gt; 00:17:17,159<br>So again, the business relationships still matter,</p>
<p>430<br>00:17:17,440 –&gt; 00:17:19,440<br>but it’s between me and the party whose infrastructure</p>
<p>431<br>00:17:19,440 –&gt; 00:17:21,640<br>my virtual components are embedded in,</p>
<p>432<br>00:17:21,640 –&gt; 00:17:24,560<br>rather than me and the neighbor I’m side by side with</p>
<p>433<br>00:17:24,560 –&gt; 00:17:27,040<br>or worse yet, domains many hops away</p>
<p>434<br>00:17:27,040 –&gt; 00:17:30,080<br>who have no accountability to me and no visibility to me.</p>
<p>435<br>00:17:30,080 –&gt; 00:17:31,840<br>So I think we can make a routing system</p>
<p>436<br>00:17:31,840 –&gt; 00:17:34,960<br>that is a lot more flexible and still cognizant</p>
<p>437<br>00:17:34,960 –&gt; 00:17:37,360<br>of the fact that there are real autonomous</p>
<p>438<br>00:17:37,360 –&gt; 00:17:39,480<br>revenue generating parties involved.</p>
<p>439<br>00:17:39,480 –&gt; 00:17:41,400<br>If we took advantage of some of the innovations</p>
<p>440<br>00:17:41,400 –&gt; 00:17:43,360<br>and virtualization over the past decade.</p>
<p>441<br>00:17:44,199 –&gt; 00:17:47,000<br>So if someone’s watching and they’re thinking</p>
<p>442<br>00:17:47,000 –&gt; 00:17:49,559<br>of going to grad school, interested in networking</p>
<p>443<br>00:17:49,559 –&gt; 00:17:53,319<br>is interdomain routing, routing still an interesting topic?</p>
<p>444<br>00:17:53,319 –&gt; 00:17:56,359<br>Is it becoming an interesting topic again?</p>
<p>445<br>00:17:56,359 –&gt; 00:17:57,199<br>What do you think?</p>
<p>446<br>00:17:57,199 –&gt; 00:17:58,039<br>What would be your advice?</p>
<p>447<br>00:17:58,039 –&gt; 00:18:00,319<br>Well, I think it’s interesting still in two ways</p>
<p>448<br>00:18:00,319 –&gt; 00:18:02,399<br>that are perhaps different than it was 15 years ago.</p>
<p>449<br>00:18:02,399 –&gt; 00:18:05,799<br>I think one is rethinking how domains can relate to each other</p>
<p>450<br>00:18:05,799 –&gt; 00:18:09,439<br>in a new economic reality, taking advantage of virtualization,</p>
<p>451<br>00:18:09,439 –&gt; 00:18:12,519<br>taking advantage of the fact that large content providers</p>
<p>452<br>00:18:12,519 –&gt; 00:18:14,480<br>are very close to their customers.</p>
<p>453<br>00:18:14,480 –&gt; 00:18:17,079<br>We often one or two hops away making the network</p>
<p>454<br>00:18:17,079 –&gt; 00:18:18,839<br>in some ways much flatter than it was when</p>
<p>455<br>00:18:18,839 –&gt; 00:18:20,119<br>BGP was designed.</p>
<p>456<br>00:18:20,119 –&gt; 00:18:22,079<br>So I think revisiting how domains interconnect</p>
<p>457<br>00:18:22,079 –&gt; 00:18:25,319<br>with one another with video and content distribution in mind</p>
<p>458<br>00:18:25,319 –&gt; 00:18:26,720<br>and with virtualization and software</p>
<p>459<br>00:18:26,720 –&gt; 00:18:28,359<br>to find networking in mind, I think</p>
<p>460<br>00:18:28,359 –&gt; 00:18:29,879<br>is an interesting opportunity.</p>
<p>461<br>00:18:29,879 –&gt; 00:18:32,160<br>And in general, we found within anything</p>
<p>462<br>00:18:32,160 –&gt; 00:18:34,359<br>interdomain in the internet stinks</p>
<p>463<br>00:18:34,359 –&gt; 00:18:38,720<br>that is very hard to deploy quality of service, security,</p>
<p>464<br>00:18:38,720 –&gt; 00:18:42,160<br>IPv6, multicast, anything like that,</p>
<p>465<br>00:18:42,160 –&gt; 00:18:43,840<br>the inside of domain is challenging enough,</p>
<p>466<br>00:18:43,840 –&gt; 00:18:46,920<br>but as soon as you need 50,000 parties to cooperate,</p>
<p>467<br>00:18:46,920 –&gt; 00:18:50,840<br>it becomes almost impossible to affect principled change.</p>
<p>468<br>00:18:50,840 –&gt; 00:18:52,960<br>And so I think a lot of the more interesting work</p>
<p>469<br>00:18:52,960 –&gt; 00:18:57,000<br>on BGP these days is looking more at incremental deployment</p>
<p>470<br>00:18:57,000 –&gt; 00:19:00,519<br>incentives for and incremental deployment solutions</p>
<p>471<br>00:19:00,519 –&gt; 00:19:03,160<br>where you get some security gain, scale,</p>
<p>472<br>00:19:03,160 –&gt; 00:19:06,800<br>guilt, ability gain, economic gain, even if only a small subset</p>
<p>473<br>00:19:06,800 –&gt; 00:19:09,160<br>of the internet adopts a technology change,</p>
<p>474<br>00:19:09,160 –&gt; 00:19:10,600<br>and then hopefully it provides incentives</p>
<p>475<br>00:19:10,599 –&gt; 00:19:12,559<br>for others to take part.</p>
<p>476<br>00:19:12,559 –&gt; 00:19:14,839<br>So I think we’ve entered a domain where it unintended,</p>
<p>477<br>00:19:14,839 –&gt; 00:19:18,000<br>a domain where work on BGP may be more focused on</p>
<p>478<br>00:19:18,000 –&gt; 00:19:21,039<br>how to evolve it in a strategic way</p>
<p>479<br>00:19:21,039 –&gt; 00:19:25,639<br>rather than what a clean slate design of BGP could look like.</p>
<p>480<br>00:19:26,679 –&gt; 00:19:28,039<br>Thank you very much, Jen.</p>
<p>481<br>00:19:28,039 –&gt; 00:19:29,879<br>This has been really interesting.</p>
<p>482<br>00:19:29,879 –&gt; 00:19:30,719<br>Great, thank you.</p>
