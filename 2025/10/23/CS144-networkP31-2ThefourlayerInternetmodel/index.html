                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,120<br>In the last video you learned how a variety of different applications such as</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,120 –&gt; 00:00:09,320<br>BitTorrent, Skype and the web all communicate over the internet using a very</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:09,320 –&gt; 00:00:14,599<br>similar model basically a bidirectional reliable byte string. It takes a lot of</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,599 –&gt; 00:00:18,559<br>different pieces working together to create this reliable communication model for</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:18,559 –&gt; 00:00:23,519<br>our applications but even though we use a huge variety of different internet</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:23,519 –&gt; 00:00:27,480<br>applications sending many kinds of data at very different speeds there are</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:27,480 –&gt; 00:00:31,679<br>surprisingly strong similarities in the way applications send and receive</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:31,679 –&gt; 00:00:35,960<br>data. For example applications want to send and receive data without having</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:35,960 –&gt; 00:00:40,880<br>to worry about the path or route that the data takes across the internet and</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:40,880 –&gt; 00:00:44,320<br>almost all applications want to be confident that their data is correctly</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:44,320 –&gt; 00:00:48,799<br>received with any lost or corrupted data automatically retransmitted until</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:48,799 –&gt; 00:00:54,480<br>it’s received correctly. The early internet pioneers created the four layer</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:54,479 –&gt; 00:00:58,159<br>internet model to describe the hierarchy of operations that make up the</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:58,159 –&gt; 00:01:02,239<br>internet so that applications can reuse the same building blocks over and over</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:02,239 –&gt; 00:01:06,000<br>again without having to create them from scratch for every new application.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:06,000 –&gt; 00:01:10,079<br>Layering is really important and frequently used concept in networking and we’ll</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:10,079 –&gt; 00:01:13,799<br>be seeing it many many times throughout this course. There’s even a video devoted</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:13,799 –&gt; 00:01:18,159<br>just to the concept of layering. Let’s look at what each layer of the four layer</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:18,159 –&gt; 00:01:22,599<br>internet model does. It helps to remember that all four layers are there to enable</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:22,599 –&gt; 00:01:27,280<br>applications in the end hosts to communicate reliably. To explain how it works</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:27,280 –&gt; 00:01:30,759<br>I’m going to start at the bottom layer. We’ll see that each layer has a</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:30,759 –&gt; 00:01:34,319<br>different responsibility with each layer building a service on top of the one</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:34,319 –&gt; 00:01:38,679<br>below all the way to the top where we have the bidirectional reliable byte stream</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:38,679 –&gt; 00:01:43,079<br>communication between applications. Okay let’s start with the link layer. The</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:43,079 –&gt; 00:01:47,919<br>internet is made up of end hosts links and routers. Data is delivered hot by</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:47,960 –&gt; 00:01:52,560<br>hop over each link in turn. Data is lit delivered in packets. A packet is a</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:52,560 –&gt; 00:01:56,480<br>self-contained unit consisting of the data we want to be delivered along with a</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:56,480 –&gt; 00:02:00,439<br>header that tells the network where the packet is to be delivered where it came</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:00,439 –&gt; 00:02:06,840<br>from and so on. The link layers job is to carry the data over one link at a time.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:06,840 –&gt; 00:02:10,800<br>You’ve probably heard of Ethernet and Wi-Fi. These are two examples of</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:10,800 –&gt; 00:02:17,599<br>different link layers. The next layer up is for us the most important layer the</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:17,599 –&gt; 00:02:23,000<br>network layer. The network’s layers job is to deliver packets end to end across</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:23,000 –&gt; 00:02:27,159<br>the internet from the source to the destination. A packet is an important</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:27,159 –&gt; 00:02:30,560<br>building block in the network. A packet is the name we give to that collection of</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:30,560 –&gt; 00:02:34,079<br>data with a header and a header that describes what the data is where it’s going</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:34,079 –&gt; 00:02:37,959<br>and where it came from as we saw in the last slide. You’ll often see packets</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:37,959 –&gt; 00:02:44,560<br>drawn like this. Network layer packets are called data grams. They consist of</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:44,560 –&gt; 00:02:49,879<br>some data and a header containing the two and from addresses just like we put</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:49,879 –&gt; 00:02:55,719<br>the two and from addresses in a letter. The network hands the data gram to the</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:55,719 –&gt; 00:03:00,479<br>link layer telling it to send the data gram over the first link. In other</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:00,479 –&gt; 00:03:04,360<br>words the link layer is providing a service to the network layer. Essentially</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:04,360 –&gt; 00:03:08,879<br>the link layer is saying if you give me a data gram to send I’ll transmit it</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:08,879 –&gt; 00:03:15,280<br>over one link for you. At the other end of the link is a router. The link layer</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:15,280 –&gt; 00:03:19,199<br>of the router accepts the data gram from the link and hands it up to the</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:19,199 –&gt; 00:03:23,560<br>network layer inside the router. The network layer on the router examines the</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:23,560 –&gt; 00:03:27,039<br>destination address of the data gram and is responsible for routing the</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:27,039 –&gt; 00:03:31,400<br>data gram one hopper to time towards its eventual destination. It does this by</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:31,400 –&gt; 00:03:38,439<br>sending it to the link layer again to carry it over the next link which is passed</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:38,439 –&gt; 00:03:42,960<br>to the network layer at the next router and so on until it reaches the network</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:42,960 –&gt; 00:03:48,879<br>layer at the destination eventually. Notice that the network layer does not need</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:48,879 –&gt; 00:03:52,719<br>to concern itself with how the link layer sends the data gram over each link.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:52,719 –&gt; 00:03:56,759<br>In fact different link layers work in very different ways. Ethernet and</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:56,759 –&gt; 00:03:59,400<br>Wi-Fi are clearly very different and we’re going to be learning about them in</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:59,400 –&gt; 00:04:04,000<br>more detail later. This separation of concerns between the network layer and the</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:04,000 –&gt; 00:04:08,039<br>link layer allows each to focus on its job without worrying about how the other</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:08,039 –&gt; 00:04:12,840<br>layer works. It also means that a single network layer has a common way to talk</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:12,840 –&gt; 00:04:17,000<br>to many different link layers by simply handing them data grams to send. This</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:17,000 –&gt; 00:04:21,719<br>separation of concerns is made possible by the modularity of each layer and a</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:21,719 –&gt; 00:04:29,039<br>common well-defined API to the layer below. In the internet the network layer is</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:29,039 –&gt; 00:04:33,279<br>special. When we send packets into the internet we must use the internet</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:33,279 –&gt; 00:04:37,920<br>protocol. It is the internet protocol or IP that holds the internet together</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:37,920 –&gt; 00:04:42,080<br>We’ll learn more about the details of IP in later videos but for now it’s good</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:42,080 –&gt; 00:04:48,960<br>to know some basic facts about IP. First of all IP makes a best effort attempt to</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:48,960 –&gt; 00:04:54,439<br>deliver our data grams to the other end but it makes no promises. Second, IP</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:54,439 –&gt; 00:04:58,560<br>data grams can get lost. They can be delivered out of order and they can be corrupted.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:58,560 –&gt; 00:05:05,680<br>There are no guarantees. This may come as a surprise. You might be asking how</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:05,680 –&gt; 00:05:09,959<br>could the internet work at all when the packets are not guaranteed to be delivered?</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:09,959 –&gt; 00:05:14,240<br>Well, if an application wants a guarantee that its data will be</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:14,240 –&gt; 00:05:18,680<br>retransmitted when necessary and will be delivered to the application in order and</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:18,680 –&gt; 00:05:23,680<br>without corruption then it needs another protocol running on top of IP. That’s</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:23,680 –&gt; 00:05:31,199<br>the job of the transport layer. The most common transport layer is TCP or the</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:31,199 –&gt; 00:05:35,199<br>transmission control protocol. You’ve probably heard of TCP IP which is when an</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:35,199 –&gt; 00:05:41,759<br>application uses both TCP and IP together. TCP’s job is to make sure that the</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:41,759 –&gt; 00:05:45,959<br>data sent by an application at one end of the internet is correctly delivered in</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:45,959 –&gt; 00:05:49,920<br>the right order to the application at the other end of the internet. If the</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:49,920 –&gt; 00:05:54,599<br>network layers drop some data grams, TCP will transmit them multiple times if</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:54,599 –&gt; 00:05:59,399<br>need be. If the network delivers them out of order, perhaps because two packets</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:59,399 –&gt; 00:06:03,360<br>follow a different path to their destination, TCP will put the data back into</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:03,360 –&gt; 00:06:08,319<br>the correct order again. In later videos you’ll learn a lot about TCP and how it</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:08,319 –&gt; 00:06:13,280<br>works. For now, the main thing you need to remember is that TCP provides a service</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:13,280 –&gt; 00:06:17,960<br>to an application that guarantees correct in order delivery of data running on</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:17,960 –&gt; 00:06:22,720<br>top of the network layer service. The network layer is providing an unreliable</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:22,720 –&gt; 00:06:28,960<br>data gram delivery service underneath. As I’m sure you can imagine, applications</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:28,959 –&gt; 00:06:33,879<br>such as a web client or an email client find TCP very useful indeed. By</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:33,879 –&gt; 00:06:37,479<br>employing TCP to make sure data is delivered correctly, they don’t have to</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:37,479 –&gt; 00:06:41,279<br>worry about implementing all of the mechanisms inside the application. They</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:41,279 –&gt; 00:06:44,560<br>can take advantage of the huge effort that other developers have put into</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:44,560 –&gt; 00:06:48,719<br>correctly implementing TCP over the years and then reuse it to deliver data</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:48,719 –&gt; 00:06:56,319<br>correctly. Reuse is a big advantage of layering. But not all applications need</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:56,319 –&gt; 00:07:00,759<br>data to be delivered correctly. For example, if a video conference application is</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:00,759 –&gt; 00:07:04,159<br>sending a snippet of video in a packet, there may be no point waiting for the</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:04,159 –&gt; 00:07:08,560<br>packet to be retransmitted multiple times. Better to just move on. Some</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:08,560 –&gt; 00:07:13,480<br>applications just don’t need the TCP service. If an application doesn’t need</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:13,480 –&gt; 00:07:18,079<br>reliable delivery, it can use the much simpler UDP or use the data gram protocol</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:18,079 –&gt; 00:07:23,039<br>instead. UDP is an alternative transport layer that bundles up application data</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:23,040 –&gt; 00:07:26,960<br>and hands it to the network layer for delivery to the other end. UDP offers</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:26,960 –&gt; 00:07:32,640<br>no delivery guarantees at all. In other words, an application has the choice of</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:32,640 –&gt; 00:07:37,240<br>at least two different transport layer services, TCP and UDP. There are in</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:37,240 –&gt; 00:07:40,960<br>fact many other choices too, but these are the most commonly used transport layer</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:40,960 –&gt; 00:07:47,480<br>services. Finally, we have the application layer at the top of the four layer</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:47,480 –&gt; 00:07:52,040<br>model. There are of course many thousands of applications using the internet.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:52,040 –&gt; 00:07:57,200<br>While each application is different, it can reuse the transport layer by using</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:57,200 –&gt; 00:08:02,760<br>the well-defined API from the application layer to the TCP or UDP service beneath.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:02,760 –&gt; 00:08:07,640<br>As we saw in the last video, applications typically want a bidirectional</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:07,640 –&gt; 00:08:12,160<br>reliable byte stream between two endpoints. They can send whatever byte stream</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:12,160 –&gt; 00:08:16,000<br>they want, and applications have their own protocol to define the syntax and</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:16,000 –&gt; 00:08:22,199<br>semantics of data flowing between the two endpoints. For example, as we saw in</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:22,199 –&gt; 00:08:26,959<br>the last video, when a web client requests a page from a web server, the web</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:26,959 –&gt; 00:08:30,839<br>client sends a get request. This is one of the commands of the Hypertext</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:30,839 –&gt; 00:08:36,440<br>Transfer Protocol or HTTP. HTTP dictates that the get command is sent as an</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:36,440 –&gt; 00:08:42,799<br>ASCII string along with the URL of the page being requested. As far as the</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:42,799 –&gt; 00:08:47,279<br>application layer is concerned, the get request is sent directly to its peer at</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:47,279 –&gt; 00:08:53,559<br>the other end, the web server application. The application doesn’t need to know</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:53,559 –&gt; 00:08:58,479<br>how the data got there or how many times it needed to be retransmitted. At the</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:58,479 –&gt; 00:09:02,279<br>web client, the application layer hands the get request to the TCP layer, which</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:02,279 –&gt; 00:09:06,199<br>provides the service of making sure it is reliably delivered. It does this using</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:06,199 –&gt; 00:09:09,279<br>the services of the network layer which in turn uses the services of the</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:09,279 –&gt; 00:09:14,000<br>link layer. We say that each layer communicates with its peer layer. It’s as if each</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:14,000 –&gt; 00:09:17,399<br>layer is only communicating with the same layer at the other end of the link</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:17,399 –&gt; 00:09:23,279<br>or internet, without regard for how the layer below gets the data there.</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:24,279 –&gt; 00:09:28,919<br>Putting it all together then, network engineers find it convenient to arrange all</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:28,919 –&gt; 00:09:32,839<br>the functions that make up the internet into layers. At the top is the</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:32,839 –&gt; 00:09:36,600<br>application such as BitTorrent or Skype or the World Wide Web, which talks to</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:36,600 –&gt; 00:09:40,920<br>its peer layer at the destination. When the application has data descend, it</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:40,920 –&gt; 00:09:44,639<br>hands the data to the transport layer, which has the job of delivering the data</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:44,639 –&gt; 00:09:49,600<br>reliably or not to the other end. The transport layer sends data to the other end</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:49,600 –&gt; 00:09:53,600<br>by handing it to the network layer, which has the job of breaking the data into</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:53,600 –&gt; 00:09:56,639<br>packets each with the correct destination address. Finally, the packets are</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:56,639 –&gt; 00:09:59,240<br>handed to the link layer, which has the responsibility of delivering the</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:59,240 –&gt; 00:10:04,040<br>packet from one hop to the next along its path. The data makes its way hop by</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:04,039 –&gt; 00:10:07,199<br>hop from one router to the next. The network layer forwards it to the next</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:07,199 –&gt; 00:10:10,959<br>router, one at a time until it reaches the destination. There the data is passed</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:10,959 –&gt; 00:10:18,039<br>up the layers until it reaches the application. So in summary, applications by</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:18,039 –&gt; 00:10:21,519<br>directional reliable byte stream between applications, typically but not always,</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:21,519 –&gt; 00:10:25,599<br>and they use application specifics of the semantics, which we’ll be learning</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:25,599 –&gt; 00:10:31,120<br>about later, such as HTTP or BitTorrent. The transport layer typically guarantees</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:31,120 –&gt; 00:10:35,399<br>correct in order delivery of data end to end and controls congestion. Although</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:35,399 –&gt; 00:10:38,200<br>some applications don’t need this and so they can use a different transport</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:38,200 –&gt; 00:10:43,840<br>layer instead. The network layer delivers data grams end to end. It’s providing a</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:43,840 –&gt; 00:10:47,440<br>best effort delivery service with no guarantees. We must use the Internet</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:47,440 –&gt; 00:10:51,519<br>protocol. The link layer delivers data over a single link between an end host</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:51,519 –&gt; 00:10:57,879<br>and a router or between two routers. There’s two extra things I’d like you to</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:57,879 –&gt; 00:11:03,679<br>know. The first is that IP is often referred to as the thin waste of the</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:03,679 –&gt; 00:11:08,840<br>Internet. This is because if we want to use the Internet, we have to use the</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:08,840 –&gt; 00:11:13,600<br>Internet protocol. We have no choice. But we have lots of choices for link layers.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:13,600 –&gt; 00:11:19,320<br>IP runs over many, many different link layers such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DSL, 3G</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:19,320 –&gt; 00:11:24,879<br>cellular and so on. And on top of the IP layer, we can choose between many</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:24,879 –&gt; 00:11:29,519<br>different transport layers. We already heard about TCP and UDP. There’s also</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:29,519 –&gt; 00:11:33,759<br>RTP for real-time data and many others too. And of course there are tens of</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:33,759 –&gt; 00:11:40,200<br>thousands of different applications sitting on top. The second thing I want you</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:40,200 –&gt; 00:11:44,399<br>to know is that in the 1980s, the International Standards Organization or ISO</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:44,399 –&gt; 00:11:50,159<br>created a seven layer model to represent any type of network. It was called the</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:50,159 –&gt; 00:11:55,559<br>seven layer open systems interconnection or OSI model. We don’t need to spend any</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:55,559 –&gt; 00:11:58,439<br>time and all in this course because it’s been replaced by the four layer</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:58,439 –&gt; 00:12:02,639<br>Internet model for all intents and purposes. But if you’re interested, you’ll find</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:02,639 –&gt; 00:12:06,919<br>any networking textbook and Wikipedia describes the seven layers in lots and</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:06,919 –&gt; 00:12:12,959<br>lots of detail. The seven layer model defines layers that were combined in the</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:12,959 –&gt; 00:12:18,319<br>four layer Internet model later. For example, what we call the link that link</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:18,320 –&gt; 00:12:23,120<br>layer today was separated into the link layer that defined the framing format</p>
<p>160<br>00:12:23,120 –&gt; 00:12:27,080<br>and the physical layer that defined things like the voltage levels on the</p>
<p>161<br>00:12:27,080 –&gt; 00:12:32,920<br>cable or the physical dimensions of a connector. The network layer is pretty</p>
<p>162<br>00:12:32,920 –&gt; 00:12:38,480<br>much the same in both models. The transport and applications layer is each</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:38,480 –&gt; 00:12:44,680<br>represented by two layers in the OSI models. These are examples of commonly</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:44,679 –&gt; 00:12:50,199<br>used Internet protocols. For example, HTTP which passes most of its data in the</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:50,199 –&gt; 00:12:56,799<br>protocol in ASCII and how they map to the OSI numbering scheme. Today, the only</p>
<p>166<br>00:12:56,799 –&gt; 00:13:00,479<br>real legacy of the seven layer OSI model that you need to know about is the</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:00,479 –&gt; 00:13:04,319<br>numbering system. You’ll often hear network engineers refer to the network</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:04,319 –&gt; 00:13:09,519<br>layer as layer three, even though it’s the second layer up from the bottom in</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:09,519 –&gt; 00:13:15,480<br>the Internet model. Similarly, you’ll hear people refer to Ethernet as link</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:15,480 –&gt; 00:13:22,360<br>the layer two and you’ll hear application referred to as layer seven.</p>
