<p>2<br>00:00:07,759 –&gt; 00:00:11,359<br>Packet switching is going to feature very prominently throughout this course.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,359 –&gt; 00:00:13,200<br>So we’re going to spend quite a bit of time on it.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:13,200 –&gt; 00:00:18,960<br>And many of the properties of the internet followed directly from the choice of packet switching.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:20,960 –&gt; 00:00:26,719<br>So in this video I’m going to give you some useful definitions for propagation delay and packetization delay.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:26,879 –&gt; 00:00:32,799<br>And we’re going to use those definitions to come up with an expression for the end to end delay of a packet across a network.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,799 –&gt; 00:00:38,320<br>I’m also going to tell you about queuing delay and how it makes the end to end delay unpredictable.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:39,280 –&gt; 00:00:42,000<br>So let’s start with some useful definitions.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:43,280 –&gt; 00:00:45,920<br>We’ll start with the definition of propagation delay.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:46,879 –&gt; 00:00:52,159<br>So the propagation delay is the time that it takes a single bit of information to travel over a link</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:52,239 –&gt; 00:01:00,959<br>at propagation speed c. So look in the picture here and you’ll see we have the computer on the left</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:00,959 –&gt; 00:01:05,679<br>and we’re going to consider the time that it takes for a bit to propagate from the one on the left to the one</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:05,679 –&gt; 00:01:11,280<br>on the right. That time the propagation delay or TsoL is simply L over c.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:14,479 –&gt; 00:01:19,840<br>So the propagation delay is simply determined by how long the link is, L in our case,</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:19,840 –&gt; 00:01:26,799<br>and the speed that a bit travels c. We use the variable c in most of the links we’re interested in</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:27,120 –&gt; 00:01:32,480<br>because c is, or the speed of propagation is very close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:33,600 –&gt; 00:01:40,320<br>For example in a twisted pair of electrical cables a bit propagates at about 70% of the speed of light</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:40,320 –&gt; 00:01:43,760<br>and then an optical fiber the speed of propagation is a tiny bit slower.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:44,640 –&gt; 00:01:49,680<br>In most of our examples we’ll assume that the bit propagates at two times 10 to the eight meters per</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:49,680 –&gt; 00:01:54,160<br>second which is which is close enough. There you go there’s the bit going along the link. Let’s</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:54,160 –&gt; 00:02:00,880<br>have a look at that again. So it’s the speed at the time at which it takes to to propagate over the link.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:02,800 –&gt; 00:02:08,800<br>So for example if we were considering how long it would take a bit to travel a thousand kilometers</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:08,800 –&gt; 00:02:14,080<br>or a million meters in an optical fiber where the propagation speed was two times 10 to the eight meters</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:14,080 –&gt; 00:02:21,760<br>per second. Well TsoL is 1000 times 10 to the three divided by two times 10 to the eight or five</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:21,760 –&gt; 00:02:26,960<br>milliseconds. In a little bit we’re going to look at some examples and you’re going to do some</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:26,960 –&gt; 00:02:33,840<br>examples in the multiple choice exercises embedded in the video. Notice that the propagation delay</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:33,840 –&gt; 00:02:38,000<br>doesn’t depend on the data rate of the link. It doesn’t matter if the link is running at one</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:38,000 –&gt; 00:02:44,400<br>kilobits per second or or at 10 gigabits per second. The propagation delay is just a function of the</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:44,400 –&gt; 00:02:55,280<br>speed of propagation of each bit and the length of the cable. Another useful definition is the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:55,280 –&gt; 00:03:02,000<br>packetization delay. This is the time from when the first bit of a packet is put onto the link</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:02,000 –&gt; 00:03:07,920<br>until the last bit is put onto the link. Let’s take a look at an example here. So see that</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:07,919 –&gt; 00:03:14,479<br>packet there going onto the link. The time that it takes to put all of the bits onto the link is</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:14,479 –&gt; 00:03:19,439<br>going to be a function of the number of bits we’re putting onto the link and the distance between</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:19,439 –&gt; 00:03:25,359<br>them or the number of bits per second that we can put onto the link. So essentially the data</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:25,359 –&gt; 00:03:31,039<br>rate of a link is determined by how close together we can pack the bits. If for example the link</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:31,039 –&gt; 00:03:36,560<br>runs at one gigabit per second we can put onto we can put one bit onto the link every now and a second.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:37,360 –&gt; 00:03:42,640<br>We’ll see in a later video about physical links what actually limits the data rate of a link.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:45,439 –&gt; 00:03:50,640<br>So the packetization delay is determined by how fast we can put bits on the link or the data rate</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:50,640 –&gt; 00:03:56,080<br>are. If a link runs at one kilobits per second we can put a thousand new bits onto the link every</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:56,080 –&gt; 00:04:01,759<br>second. If it runs at 10 gigabits per second then we can put 10 billion bits onto the link every</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:01,759 –&gt; 00:04:09,759<br>second. There we go a couple of examples. If we had a 64 byte packet that’s 512 bits it would take</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:09,759 –&gt; 00:04:16,480<br>5.12 microseconds to be transmitted onto a hundred megabits per second link. Why is that? Well T sub</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:16,480 –&gt; 00:04:26,959<br>P equals P over R. So P in our case is 64 times 8 512 divided by R and R would be 100 times 10 to</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:26,959 –&gt; 00:04:37,599<br>the 6. Another example a kilobit packet takes 1.024 seconds to be transmitted onto a 1 kilobit per</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:37,599 –&gt; 00:04:46,000<br>second link. So where did this 1.024 come from? Well this is useful example here because the 1 kilobit</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:46,000 –&gt; 00:04:53,759<br>per second, sorry the 1 kilobit packet that we see here, 1 kilobit when we’re measuring a number of</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:53,759 –&gt; 00:04:59,839<br>bits in a packet or in memory, 1 kilobit as you know is a thousand and 24 or two to the power of 10.</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:01,039 –&gt; 00:05:08,560<br>So that’s why we have 1.024 seconds in order to transmit it onto a 1 kilobit per second link.</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:08,560 –&gt; 00:05:13,920<br>So in this case it’s a little bit confusing. 1 kilobit per second means 1000 bits per second</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:13,920 –&gt; 00:05:20,560<br>whereas the 1 kilobit in the packet is 1,024 bits. This is standard throughout networking and we’ll</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:20,560 –&gt; 00:05:30,160<br>see this happen over and over again. So notice that the packetization delay is only a function of</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:30,160 –&gt; 00:05:40,160<br>the length of the packet that’s P here and the rate at which we can put bits onto the link or</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:40,160 –&gt; 00:05:48,160<br>R bits per second. Makes no difference how long the link is or how fast bits propagate along it.</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:51,120 –&gt; 00:05:59,839<br>So next we’re going to see how we can use our two different types of delay to determine the overall end to end delay.</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:01,040 –&gt; 00:06:05,199<br>That’s the time it takes a packet to go across a network from the source to the destination.</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:08,399 –&gt; 00:06:15,519<br>So the end to end delay is the time from when we send the first bit on the first link that would be over here</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:16,000 –&gt; 00:06:21,839<br>until the last bit of the packet arrives at the destination B.</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:26,079 –&gt; 00:06:31,599<br>So we can calculate the end to end delay by adding up the propagation and packetization delays</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:31,599 –&gt; 00:06:38,639<br>on every link along the path. That is we can look at those numbers that we calculated before</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:38,639 –&gt; 00:06:44,240<br>for how long it takes a packet from the first bit until the first bit is sent until the last bit</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:44,240 –&gt; 00:06:50,800<br>arrives on this link here. And then we can add it to the time on here, on here and on here.</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:53,439 –&gt; 00:06:59,680<br>So in our case that’s going to depend on the length of the first link and the rate at which it runs.</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:01,280 –&gt; 00:07:06,480<br>And then we can use our expressions to calculate the end to end delay. And we’re going to come up with</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:06,480 –&gt; 00:07:13,920<br>an expression that looks like this. The end to end delay t equals the sum of the first of all the</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:17,280 –&gt; 00:07:23,920<br>delay here which is the packetization delay, the time that it takes to put the packet onto the link.</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:23,920 –&gt; 00:07:28,720<br>And then the time it takes for one bit to propagate along that link. So we’re going to sum up all</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:28,720 –&gt; 00:07:35,920<br>of those to get the end to end delay. Let’s look at this in a little bit more example because I think</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:35,920 –&gt; 00:07:42,080<br>it’ll become a bit clearer. So in our example here the packet is going to traverse four links.</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:45,120 –&gt; 00:07:49,759<br>So we’re going to repeat the process on every link along the path and it’s going to look something</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:49,759 –&gt; 00:07:55,680<br>like this. Here we’re taking a closer look by stretching out the links and the switches and</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:55,680 –&gt; 00:08:03,200<br>remove the rest of the network just to make a little bit clearer. This here is a timeline and this</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:03,199 –&gt; 00:08:09,680<br>timeline with time increasing from the left to the right is going to show how bits propagate and how</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:09,680 –&gt; 00:08:22,959<br>the whole packet propagates from A over to B. So the first bit is going to take L1 over C.</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:23,919 –&gt; 00:08:29,279<br>That’s the length of that first link divided by the propagation speed. It’s going to take that</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:29,279 –&gt; 00:08:36,319<br>number of seconds to propagate from A to S1. So here we can see the bit starting from here and</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:36,319 –&gt; 00:08:43,600<br>then propagating along the link. L1 over C is the time and this is it propagating the distance from A</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:43,600 –&gt; 00:08:57,600<br>to S1. After we sent the first bit it’s going to take P over R1 seconds until we can put the last</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:57,600 –&gt; 00:09:05,200<br>bit of the packet under the link. So after P over R1 we’ve put the last bit under the link and then</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:05,200 –&gt; 00:09:18,399<br>at the time L1C plus P over R1 that last bit will arrive at switch S1. Okay so at this point by the</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:18,399 –&gt; 00:09:29,120<br>time we get to this point here the entire packet has arrived at S1. So internet routers are what we</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:29,120 –&gt; 00:09:37,840<br>call store and forward devices. What that means is that the switch S1 is going to wait until the whole</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:37,840 –&gt; 00:09:45,600<br>packet arrives until it looks up the address and decides where to send it next. It could instead start</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:45,600 –&gt; 00:09:49,840<br>forwarding the packet after it had just seen the header and not wait for the whole packet to arrive.</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:49,840 –&gt; 00:09:54,639<br>That’s something we call cut through switching but internet routers generally don’t do that. In a</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:54,639 –&gt; 00:09:59,759<br>later video and in some of the exercises we’ll see examples of cut through packet switches. But</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:59,759 –&gt; 00:10:05,279<br>getting back to our example which is a store on forward network where every switch is going to store</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:05,279 –&gt; 00:10:12,399<br>and forward the packets. Switch S1 is going to look at the packet after it’s completely arrived and</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:12,399 –&gt; 00:10:17,759<br>then it’s going to send it onto the next link. It’s going to send it onto S2. So here we can see</p>
<p>89<br>00:10:17,759 –&gt; 00:10:29,039<br>that packet going onto S2. So just as before it takes L2 over C for the first bit to arrive at S2</p>
<p>90<br>00:10:29,039 –&gt; 00:10:35,360<br>and then the last bit will arrive P over R2 seconds later. And we can just repeat this whole process</p>
<p>91<br>00:10:35,360 –&gt; 00:10:43,120<br>for each of the links in turn until we get to B. So the overall end to end delay expression is</p>
<p>92<br>00:10:43,120 –&gt; 00:10:48,800<br>just the sum of those from end to end which is the same expression we had before.</p>
<p>93<br>00:10:53,680 –&gt; 00:10:58,639<br>Okay so it turns out I’ve only told you part of the story. Let me tell you the rest of the story.</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:58,639 –&gt; 00:11:04,000<br>See the thing about packet switching is that your packets share the links with packets from other</p>
<p>95<br>00:11:04,000 –&gt; 00:11:13,440<br>users. When several packets show up at the same time wanting to go on the same link and you can see</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:13,440 –&gt; 00:11:19,360<br>this here we’ve got packets coming from here maybe from another link entering the packet switch</p>
<p>97<br>00:11:19,360 –&gt; 00:11:24,960<br>and from here coming into the packet switch from another link all wanting to go on this outgoing</p>
<p>98<br>00:11:24,960 –&gt; 00:11:31,679<br>link from S2 to S3. When this happens all of the packets are going to have to fight or contend for</p>
<p>99<br>00:11:31,679 –&gt; 00:11:39,599<br>that outgoing link. So when several packets show up at the same time wanting to go on the same</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:39,599 –&gt; 00:11:45,759<br>link in this case from S2 to S3 then some of the packets have to wait in the router’s queue and this</p>
<p>101<br>00:11:45,759 –&gt; 00:11:51,759<br>little symbol here, see this little red symbol here is the picture that I’m going to draw for a queue.</p>
<p>102<br>00:11:54,479 –&gt; 00:11:58,959<br>Some people call that a packet buffer. In general let’s say first come first serve queue in which</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:58,960 –&gt; 00:12:04,000<br>the packets are going to depart in the same order that they arrive. We’re going to say that the</p>
<p>104<br>00:12:04,000 –&gt; 00:12:10,080<br>link from S2 to S3 is congested because there are lots of packets queued waiting to travel along it.</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:10,879 –&gt; 00:12:15,120<br>The packet buffer helps prevent us from having to drop any packets. The bigger the buffer is</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:15,120 –&gt; 00:12:19,600<br>the less likely we are to have to drop a packet that wants to travel across the link.</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:20,800 –&gt; 00:12:27,040<br>So these packet buffers they’re going to be in all of the switches. Every packet switch has</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:27,039 –&gt; 00:12:32,240<br>buffers and they’re fundamental to packets switching. If we didn’t have packet buffers then we’d</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:32,240 –&gt; 00:12:37,839<br>lose a packet every time two packets showed up at the same time wanting to travel across a link.</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:38,719 –&gt; 00:12:43,199<br>So packet buffers are our friends but the packet buffers themselves are going to change our</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:43,199 –&gt; 00:12:51,679<br>expression for the end to end delay. If our packet arrives and the queue has some packets in it then</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:51,679 –&gt; 00:12:56,879<br>it’s going to delay the time that it can be forwarded onto the next link because it can have</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:56,879 –&gt; 00:13:01,599<br>to wait for the packets that are ahead of it to leave first before our packet gets to go.</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:03,279 –&gt; 00:13:09,359<br>So I’ve just shown this here as queue 2 of t meaning it’s going over the link from S2</p>
<p>115<br>00:13:09,919 –&gt; 00:13:14,000<br>and I’ve said it’s queue 2 of t because it’s going to vary with time. It’s going to depend on how</p>
<p>116<br>00:13:14,000 –&gt; 00:13:21,439<br>many other packets are showing up from other users. So if there are three packets ahead of us we’ll</p>
<p>117<br>00:13:21,440 –&gt; 00:13:28,880<br>have to wait for three packetization delays before it’s our turn to go. I’ve shown this just in</p>
<p>118<br>00:13:28,880 –&gt; 00:13:33,760<br>one queue of course this can be in all of the switches along the way just makes the figure a bit</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:33,760 –&gt; 00:13:41,040<br>more complicated so I’ve just shown it in queue 2. So we’re into end delay now has a third component</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:41,040 –&gt; 00:13:49,040<br>to it. It has in it the packetization delay that we saw before that’s P over R sub i then it has the</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:49,279 –&gt; 00:13:58,319<br>propagation delay over the link and then it has this new expression qi of t which is the delay</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:58,319 –&gt; 00:14:02,799<br>of the packet in the queue waiting for other packets and this could be zero if there are no other</p>
<p>123<br>00:14:02,799 –&gt; 00:14:09,039<br>packets of course but in general it’s going to be some non-deterministic value because we don’t</p>
<p>124<br>00:14:09,039 –&gt; 00:14:17,839<br>know whoever else is sending packets at the same time. So the most important thing to note here is</p>
<p>125<br>00:14:17,840 –&gt; 00:14:24,960<br>everything is deterministic except the queueing delay. P over R sub i lie over c they’re both</p>
<p>126<br>00:14:24,960 –&gt; 00:14:31,040<br>deterministic it’s qi sub qi of t the queueing delay that is the variable component and it</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:31,040 –&gt; 00:14:37,600<br>convinced you that really in practice there is variability I’m going to show you an example in a</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:37,600 –&gt; 00:14:44,560<br>moment one last thing so you may have noticed that I that I use the the British spelling for</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:44,559 –&gt; 00:14:50,159<br>queuing that’s not because I’m English but it’s very common in when talking about the internet</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:50,159 –&gt; 00:14:56,479<br>to spell queuing qeueueue ing seems like too many vowels I know but this was the convention</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:56,479 –&gt; 00:15:02,239<br>adopted by Kleinrock one of the pioneers and inventors of the internet back in the 1960s but you’ll see</p>
<p>132<br>00:15:02,239 –&gt; 00:15:09,439<br>both both the uk and the u rs spelling and that’s just fine. So in summary here’s our overall expression</p>
<p>133<br>00:15:09,440 –&gt; 00:15:16,240<br>for the end to end delay it’s taking into consideration the queuing delay at each packet switch</p>
<p>134<br>00:15:16,240 –&gt; 00:15:20,400<br>along the way it’s really important to remember that the queuing delay is unpredictable it depends</p>
<p>135<br>00:15:20,400 –&gt; 00:15:25,520<br>on the traffic sent by other users in the network as far as we’re concerned the queuing delay is a</p>
<p>136<br>00:15:25,520 –&gt; 00:15:30,560<br>random variable it’s the only random variable in our expression for end to end delay everything</p>
<p>137<br>00:15:30,560 –&gt; 00:15:36,480<br>else is deterministic. So in case you don’t believe me that the end to end delay is unpredictable we’re</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:36,480 –&gt; 00:15:42,960<br>going to measure it. I’m going to use a very widely used tool called ping png to measure the end</p>
<p>139<br>00:15:42,960 –&gt; 00:15:49,039<br>to end delay between my computer and other computers in the internet. Ping is going to measure this</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:49,039 –&gt; 00:15:53,200<br>end to end delay in fact it’s going to measure the round trip time which is the end to end it’s</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:53,200 –&gt; 00:15:57,680<br>some of the end to end delay in both directions you’ll find the ping command on your computer and you</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:57,680 –&gt; 00:16:02,639<br>can use it to repeat the measurements I’m about to do on your own computer and it’s kind of a fun thing</p>
<p>143<br>00:16:02,639 –&gt; 00:16:10,480<br>to do. We can measure the delay of packets across the internet using the ping command. I’m going to</p>
<p>144<br>00:16:10,480 –&gt; 00:16:15,919<br>show you an example of the ping command right now so I’m going to ping from my computer to</p>
<p>145<br>00:16:16,960 –&gt; 00:16:24,159<br>Princeton.edu. Princeton is university in New Jersey in the United States it’s about 4000 kilometers</p>
<p>146<br>00:16:24,159 –&gt; 00:16:31,840<br>or two and a half thousand miles from where I am and as I do this you can see over on the right hand</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:31,840 –&gt; 00:16:38,639<br>side it’s showing me the time that it takes for the packets that I send to go to Princeton and back</p>
<p>148<br>00:16:38,639 –&gt; 00:16:45,680<br>again so let’s say if I can highlight these so if you see them like here these are the times of the</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:45,680 –&gt; 00:16:51,200<br>packets to go there and back again. So those numbers there are about a hundred milliseconds</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:51,200 –&gt; 00:16:55,519<br>corresponding to the time that it takes for a packet to go there and back over the round trip time.</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:55,519 –&gt; 00:17:04,000<br>Let’s see how that compares with by ping to let’s try the university of Shinghua University in</p>
<p>152<br>00:17:05,039 –&gt; 00:17:10,720<br>in Beijing in China. So we’re going to see that’s a lot further away that’s about 10,000 kilometers</p>
<p>153<br>00:17:10,720 –&gt; 00:17:17,200<br>away from me for about 6000 miles and you can see that the ping times are much greater so if I can</p>
<p>154<br>00:17:17,200 –&gt; 00:17:27,920<br>just highlight those we can see those there more like 200 milliseconds. So I use ping to measure</p>
<p>155<br>00:17:27,920 –&gt; 00:17:35,840<br>a few hundred RTT values from my computer at Stanford to Princeton and as I said earlier it’s about</p>
<p>156<br>00:17:35,840 –&gt; 00:17:44,000<br>4000 kilometers or two and a half thousand miles away. The graph shows the CDF that’s the cumulative</p>
<p>157<br>00:17:44,000 –&gt; 00:17:53,359<br>distribution function for the values that I measured. So 0% this means that none of the values were</p>
<p>158<br>00:17:53,359 –&gt; 00:18:00,720<br>below this value here which is about a hundred milliseconds and a hundred percent of them were</p>
<p>159<br>00:18:01,599 –&gt; 00:18:09,039<br>less than let’s say 300 milliseconds little hard to tell on this graph here. So this shows the</p>
<p>160<br>00:18:09,039 –&gt; 00:18:17,440<br>range and also the variation in the values that I measured. And the overall variance is about</p>
<p>161<br>00:18:18,159 –&gt; 00:18:30,000<br>variation is about 50 milliseconds and the 90% of the samples fell between 100 and 120 milliseconds.</p>
<p>162<br>00:18:30,639 –&gt; 00:18:35,119<br>Now let’s look what happened when I repeated the experiment from Stanford to</p>
<p>163<br>00:18:35,759 –&gt; 00:18:42,239<br>Jinghua University which is in Beijing in China. It’s a lot further away it’s about 10,000 kilometers</p>
<p>164<br>00:18:42,239 –&gt; 00:18:48,959<br>away or 6000 miles and as I would expect the RTT values are much larger because the propagation</p>
<p>165<br>00:18:48,959 –&gt; 00:18:57,599<br>delay is much higher. But also notice that the RTT samples have much greater variance. They vary</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:57,599 –&gt; 00:19:03,199<br>by a lot more. Look at this value over here, this range of values, they’re varying by a lot more than</p>
<p>167<br>00:19:03,279 –&gt; 00:19:10,880<br>the ones over the shorter length from Stanford to Princeton. So that variation here comes from the</p>
<p>168<br>00:19:10,880 –&gt; 00:19:17,120<br>queuing delay. My packets are encountering more cues, more congestion, more other users, more</p>
<p>169<br>00:19:17,120 –&gt; 00:19:26,080<br>other users traffic when they’re going across the Pacific to China. My packets meet the other</p>
<p>170<br>00:19:26,080 –&gt; 00:19:30,400<br>packets in the route above as along the way and so they get held up they have to wait for longer.</p>
<p>171<br>00:19:30,400 –&gt; 00:19:34,160<br>And I guess probably because there are more hops and more likely to encounter other people’s</p>
<p>172<br>00:19:34,160 –&gt; 00:19:42,560<br>packets along the way. With a range of about 200 milliseconds, it’s about 320 down here and maybe</p>
<p>173<br>00:19:42,560 –&gt; 00:19:48,560<br>they’re going up to about 520. With a range of about 200 milliseconds the queuing delay is making up</p>
<p>174<br>00:19:48,560 –&gt; 00:19:53,280<br>almost half of the overall end to end delay. That’s pretty high. In fact that’s kind of unusually</p>
<p>175<br>00:19:53,280 –&gt; 00:19:57,280<br>high which is why I showed you this as an example just to get the point across.</p>
<p>176<br>00:19:57,839 –&gt; 00:20:04,160<br>In summary, the end to end delay is determined by three components. The first is the propagation</p>
<p>177<br>00:20:04,160 –&gt; 00:20:08,399<br>delay along the links which are determined by the lengths of the links and the propagation speed.</p>
<p>178<br>00:20:08,960 –&gt; 00:20:13,839<br>The second is the packetization delay which is determined by the length of the packet and the</p>
<p>179<br>00:20:13,839 –&gt; 00:20:18,879<br>data rate of each link. The third is the queuing delay which is determined by the congestion and</p>
<p>180<br>00:20:18,879 –&gt; 00:20:25,519<br>the queuing delay and the buffers and the routers along the path. This is the end of the video on</p>
<p>181<br>00:20:25,519 –&gt; 00:20:30,720<br>end to end delay in packet switching. In the next video I will be explaining what some of the</p>
<p>182<br>00:20:30,720 –&gt; 00:20:35,279<br>consequences are of this variable queuing delay, particularly on real-time applications which</p>
<p>183<br>00:20:35,279 –&gt; 00:20:44,720<br>frequently use playback buffers to absorb this variation.</p>
