<p>2<br>00:00:04,139 –&gt; 00:00:08,700<br>how packet switches work. That’s things like ethernet switches, internet routers,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,700 –&gt; 00:00:17,500<br>and so on. In this video we’re going to learn about what a packet switch looks</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,500 –&gt; 00:00:21,500<br>like, what a packet switch does, whether it’s an ethernet switch or an internet</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,500 –&gt; 00:00:27,300<br>router, and how address lookups work. So let’s start with a picture of a generic</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:27,300 –&gt; 00:00:33,179<br>packet switch. The three main stages of a packet switch are that when a packet</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:33,179 –&gt; 00:00:36,899<br>arrives, the first thing that we do is look up at the address. This means looking</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:36,899 –&gt; 00:00:40,899<br>at the destination address to figure out where it’s going to go next. We do this</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:40,899 –&gt; 00:00:45,179<br>by looking up in a forwarding table. We send the destination address down to the</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:45,179 –&gt; 00:00:48,859<br>forwarding table, which will tell us the egress link or the port that it’s going</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,859 –&gt; 00:00:53,460<br>to, and that helps us decide where to send it next. The next thing that we may need</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:53,460 –&gt; 00:00:58,100<br>to do is to update the header. So for example, if it’s an internet router, we have</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:58,100 –&gt; 00:01:03,740<br>to decrement the TTL and update the checksum. The next thing we have to do is to</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:03,740 –&gt; 00:01:09,099<br>queue the packet. This is because there may be some congestion, there may be many</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:09,099 –&gt; 00:01:13,060<br>packets trying to get to this outgoing link at the same time. So we use a buffer</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:13,060 –&gt; 00:01:18,260<br>memory to hold some packets that are waiting their turn to depart on the egress</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,260 –&gt; 00:01:23,260<br>line. Of course, one input, one output packet switch is not very</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:23,260 –&gt; 00:01:26,820<br>interesting. Packets which is in general will have multiple inputs and</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:26,820 –&gt; 00:01:30,180<br>multiple outputs. His one with three inputs and three outputs, packets will</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:30,180 –&gt; 00:01:34,980<br>arrive. And I’ve color coded these ones. The red packets are going to the red</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:34,980 –&gt; 00:01:42,820<br>output over here, and the blue one is going to the blue output up here. So just</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:42,820 –&gt; 00:01:45,939<br>as before, the packets are going to be processed. The address is going to be</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:45,939 –&gt; 00:01:49,540<br>looked up. It will update the header if we need to. Then we’re going to transfer</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:49,540 –&gt; 00:01:54,820<br>it across that back plane. This is supposed to represent a shared bus over which</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:54,820 –&gt; 00:01:58,020<br>all of these packets are going to pass. And then they’re going to find their way</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:58,020 –&gt; 00:02:02,100<br>to the output queue. In this case, we’ve got two red packets that are going to</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:02,100 –&gt; 00:02:07,580<br>contend for the same output. So what we’ll need to do is we can send the blue one</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:07,580 –&gt; 00:02:12,180<br>to its output. We can send one of the red ones all the way through to its output.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:12,180 –&gt; 00:02:17,219<br>But because we can only send one packet at a time, the other red packet is</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:17,219 –&gt; 00:02:21,419<br>going to have to wait in the buffer memory until the until the first one is gone.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:21,419 –&gt; 00:02:25,939<br>Once it’s gone, this one can go on its way. So this is sort of the generic</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:25,939 –&gt; 00:02:32,180<br>structure of a packet switch. More specifically, one very common type of</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:32,180 –&gt; 00:02:37,740<br>packet switch is an ethernet switch. These are the four basic operations that an</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:37,740 –&gt; 00:02:41,939<br>ethernet switch must perform. So it’s an ethernet switch as an example of a</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:41,939 –&gt; 00:02:45,460<br>packet switch. It’s just a very specific one that’s dealing with ethernet</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:45,460 –&gt; 00:02:50,020<br>ethernet frames. So the first thing it does is it examines the header of each</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:50,020 –&gt; 00:02:55,860<br>arriving frame. If the ethernet destination address, if the destination address,</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:55,860 –&gt; 00:02:59,980<br>and these are 48 bit addresses with ethernet, if it finds that address in the</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:59,980 –&gt; 00:03:04,260<br>forwarding table, it’s going to forward the frame to the correct outgoing port or</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:04,260 –&gt; 00:03:11,020<br>maybe a selection of ports if it’s a multi-cast packet. If it finds that the</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:11,020 –&gt; 00:03:16,980<br>ethernet destination address is not in the table, in an ethernet switch it</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:16,980 –&gt; 00:03:22,180<br>broadcasts the frames to all ports. Well, all ports except the one through which</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:22,180 –&gt; 00:03:25,580<br>the frame arrived. In other words, it doesn’t know where to send it, so it’s going to</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:25,580 –&gt; 00:03:31,860<br>flood it to everybody in the hope that it’ll reach its destination. How does it</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:31,860 –&gt; 00:03:35,460<br>populate the table in the first place? Well, it does this by learning addresses</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:35,460 –&gt; 00:03:40,040<br>that it sees on the wire. More specifically, when a packet arrives, the</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:40,039 –&gt; 00:03:45,799<br>entries in the table are learned by examining the ethernet source address of</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:45,799 –&gt; 00:03:51,599<br>arriving packets. So when packets first come through, the destination address is</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:51,599 –&gt; 00:03:57,799<br>not in the table. It’s broadcast to everybody. Hopefully the other end will</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:57,799 –&gt; 00:04:02,000<br>respond. Send a packet back. We’ll see its source address and we will therefore</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:02,000 –&gt; 00:04:06,000<br>learn that in future we must send packets through that particular port to reach</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:06,000 –&gt; 00:04:09,319<br>that particular address. So these are the four basic operations of an ethernet</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:09,319 –&gt; 00:04:13,479<br>switch. Let’s contrast that with an internet router, another type of packet</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:13,479 –&gt; 00:04:20,319<br>switch, which processes the internet destination, the IP destination address</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:20,319 –&gt; 00:04:25,560<br>instead. So there’s seven basic operations. Because it’s dealing with IP</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:25,560 –&gt; 00:04:30,360<br>data grams that are encapsulated in ethernet packets, first of all it’s</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:30,360 –&gt; 00:04:34,879<br>going to check to see whether the ethernet destination address of the</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:34,879 –&gt; 00:04:39,519<br>arriving frame belongs to the router. In other words, is it specifically addressed</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:39,519 –&gt; 00:04:44,319<br>to this router? If it is, it accepts it. If it doesn’t, it drops it because it’s</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:44,319 –&gt; 00:04:50,480<br>clearly not destined for us. The next thing it does is to check that the IP</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:50,480 –&gt; 00:04:55,680<br>version number is four, if it’s an IPv4 router, and checks the length of the</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:55,680 –&gt; 00:05:01,680<br>data gram. Next, it’s going to decrement the TTL and update the IP header checks</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:01,680 –&gt; 00:05:07,120<br>them because the checksum includes the TTL. It checks to see if the TTL equals</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:07,120 –&gt; 00:05:10,800<br>zero. If it does, it drops the packet. If it doesn’t, then it can continue to</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:10,800 –&gt; 00:05:16,120<br>forward it. Next, it’s going to look up in the the forwarding table. If the</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:16,120 –&gt; 00:05:20,600<br>IP destination address is in the forwarding table, it’s going to forward it to the</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:20,600 –&gt; 00:05:25,319<br>correct egress port or ports if it’s multicast. And this is the correct</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:25,319 –&gt; 00:05:32,120<br>port to reach the next hop because IP is doing hot by hot routing. Now it’s</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:32,120 –&gt; 00:05:36,040<br>decided which port it’s going to depart from. It encapsulates the IP data</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:36,040 –&gt; 00:05:41,120<br>gram back into an ethernet frame. And it has to figure out the correct ethernet</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:41,120 –&gt; 00:05:44,399<br>destination address to use for the next hop router. We’ll learn this process</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:44,399 –&gt; 00:05:48,920<br>later at something called ARP. And so it’ll encapsulate the IP data</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:48,920 –&gt; 00:05:54,560<br>gram into the ethernet frame, create the new ethernet frame and then send it</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:54,560 –&gt; 00:06:01,240<br>onto the wire. So the basic operations of a packet switcher to look up the</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:01,240 –&gt; 00:06:04,519<br>address. So we’re going to ask the question, how is this address looked up in the</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:04,519 –&gt; 00:06:08,439<br>forwarding table? I’m going to show you some examples in the moment. The second</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:08,439 –&gt; 00:06:12,879<br>operation is switching. Once it’s figured out which egress port it needs to go</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:12,879 –&gt; 00:06:16,959<br>do, it now has to send it to that correct output. It’s got to deliver it to that</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:16,959 –&gt; 00:06:21,680<br>correct output port so it can leave on the correct outgoing link. I’m going to</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:21,680 –&gt; 00:06:26,319<br>start with the lookup address. And then in the next video we’re going to learn</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:26,319 –&gt; 00:06:34,600<br>about switching. So for ethernet switches looking up the address is very straight</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:34,600 –&gt; 00:06:38,600<br>forward. It will have a forwarding table which I’ve drawn in a very simplified form</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:38,600 –&gt; 00:06:45,439<br>here. This is the match that it’s going to perform. This is what it’s going to</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:45,439 –&gt; 00:06:49,000<br>try and match the ethernet destination address on. And this is then the action</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:49,000 –&gt; 00:06:55,279<br>that’s going to perform if it finds a match. If an incoming ethernet frame has a</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:55,279 –&gt; 00:07:01,879<br>destination address that matches this one here, then it’s going to forward it to port</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:01,879 –&gt; 00:07:05,839<br>seven. If it matches on this address here, then it’s going to forward it to port three.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:05,839 –&gt; 00:07:11,639<br>I’ve just drawn the 48 bit addresses here as hexadecimal numbers. Okay, so the</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:11,639 –&gt; 00:07:18,720<br>ethernet forwarding table has a number of rows one for each address and for each</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:18,720 –&gt; 00:07:22,560<br>address it’s going to tell it which port that it needs to forward to. And if it misses</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:22,560 –&gt; 00:07:27,360<br>then it broadcasts because that’s what ethernet switches do when they don’t know the address</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:27,360 –&gt; 00:07:34,880<br>to send it to. Now to do this lookup, the way that it performs this lookup is that typically</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:34,880 –&gt; 00:07:39,600<br>it stores these addresses in a hash table because these are 48 bit addresses but there’s</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:39,600 –&gt; 00:07:44,640<br>nothing like 2 to the 48 entries. There may be 100,000 maybe even a million entries. So</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:44,639 –&gt; 00:07:49,360<br>nothing like 2 to the power of 48. So it’s a very sparse table. So typically they store</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:49,360 –&gt; 00:07:55,639<br>addresses in a hash table. It might be a two-way hash to increase the probability of having</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:55,639 –&gt; 00:08:02,319<br>a hit on the first try. And then it will look up the match by looking for an exact match</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:02,319 –&gt; 00:08:07,399<br>in the hash table. In other words, it’s looking for an exact match on that 48 bit address.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:07,399 –&gt; 00:08:12,240<br>So that’s how address lookups are done in an ethernet switch. Now let’s look at how they’re</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:12,240 –&gt; 00:08:20,360<br>done in an IP router and in an internet router. So IP addresses are a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:20,360 –&gt; 00:08:25,519<br>IP addresses, we don’t just look up on an exact match. We look up on what’s called a</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:25,519 –&gt; 00:08:32,360<br>longest prefix match. We’ll learn about why that is later when we learn about IP addresses.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:32,360 –&gt; 00:08:37,639<br>But suffice to know right now, we’re performing a longest prefix match rather than an exact</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:37,639 –&gt; 00:08:44,559<br>match. So just as before, we’ve got some matches here of some IP prefixes. And I’ll tell you</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:44,559 –&gt; 00:08:49,960<br>what those are in a moment. And then this is the action that we would perform. So for example,</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:49,960 –&gt; 00:08:56,879<br>if we had a match on this IP destination address, this one here, and this is a specific IP</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:56,879 –&gt; 00:09:04,759<br>destination address, 127.43.57.99. So that’ll be a 32 bit address. We’re going to forward it to</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:04,759 –&gt; 00:09:10,960<br>this IP address. So this is actually the IP address of the interface of the next router that</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:10,960 –&gt; 00:09:17,080<br>we’re going to. After it’s made this decision, it’s going to resolve this. It’s going to turn</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:17,080 –&gt; 00:09:22,840<br>this IP address into the equivalent ethernet destination address of that interface so that</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:22,840 –&gt; 00:09:28,319<br>it knows what to encapsulate the packet into. But anyway, for inside the forwarding table,</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:28,319 –&gt; 00:09:32,799<br>it maintains it as an IP address. So if we see something that matches here, then this is the</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:32,799 –&gt; 00:09:40,959<br>action that we perform. So let’s look at what a longest prefix match is. Along here, I’ve got the</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:40,959 –&gt; 00:09:49,039<br>the IP version for address number line. In other words, all of the possible two to the 32 different</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:49,039 –&gt; 00:09:57,199<br>addresses that we can have in an IP destination address. I want to have got up here as some line</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:57,200 –&gt; 00:10:04,640<br>segments. These line segments are prefixes. And they’re always represented as in the following form.</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:04,640 –&gt; 00:10:12,680<br>This line segment here corresponds to all of the addresses that start with 65. The interpretation</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:12,680 –&gt; 00:10:21,280<br>of this is all of those with 65 as the first eight bits. So if a packet and incoming destination</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:21,280 –&gt; 00:10:26,920<br>address has 65 as the first eight bits of address, then it’s going to match on this line</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:26,919 –&gt; 00:10:33,279<br>segment. And this line segment represent all the IP addresses that start with 65 in their first eight</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:33,279 –&gt; 00:10:41,439<br>bit locations. Similarly, this line segment here corresponds to all of the IP addresses that their</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:41,439 –&gt; 00:10:51,319<br>first 16 bits are 128.9. So there are two to the power of 16 addresses here, all with the first 16 bits 128.9.</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:51,320 –&gt; 00:11:01,440<br>And so we represent that prefix as 128.9.00 slash 16 corresponding to those first 16 bits. Finally,</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:01,440 –&gt; 00:11:08,400<br>one more example. This one up here, which is a very short line segment, is all those addresses that</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:08,400 –&gt; 00:11:15,240<br>share the first 24 bits. This means there are two to the eight of them or 256 different addresses that</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:15,240 –&gt; 00:11:22,519<br>all start with 128.9.176. Okay, so when a packet arrives with a particular destination address,</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:22,519 –&gt; 00:11:28,919<br>and here’s an example here, this one is clearly going to match on this line segment right here.</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:31,799 –&gt; 00:11:37,639<br>So this is the address on the number line. This is where it matches here so that we know that the</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:37,639 –&gt; 00:11:42,360<br>prefix that we’ve matched on in the table is this one. So the table will contain this entry here.</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:42,360 –&gt; 00:11:51,159<br>This address will match on this entry in the table. Similarly, this address 128.9.16.14 is going to</p>
<p>131<br>00:11:51,159 –&gt; 00:11:59,680<br>match on this line segment here. Notice that it matched on this one, but this one is a is a longer matching</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:59,680 –&gt; 00:12:05,279<br>prefix. More of the bits match on this one than they do on this one. This is a longer longer prefix. It’s</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:05,279 –&gt; 00:12:11,000<br>21 bits prefix, whereas this one is only a 16 bit prefix. So because it matches on both and this is</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:11,000 –&gt; 00:12:20,039<br>the longest one, the address this address here will match on this prefix here in the table. So in</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:20,039 –&gt; 00:12:26,600<br>routing lookups, what we do is we find the longest matching prefix, also known as the most</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:26,600 –&gt; 00:12:34,759<br>specific route amongst all the prefixes that match the destination address. Let’s look at how we</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:34,759 –&gt; 00:12:41,399<br>might implement this in a table. And one common implementation is to use what’s called a binary</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:41,399 –&gt; 00:12:48,519<br>tri TRIE. And there are many variations of this, but this is the most common one here. Let’s say that</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:48,519 –&gt; 00:12:53,879<br>we had a prefix table that looked like this. This prefix table is a bit strange because all the</p>
<p>140<br>00:12:53,879 –&gt; 00:12:58,919<br>prefixes are very short. I’m just doing that so that they can be clearly represented in this table.</p>
<p>141<br>00:12:58,919 –&gt; 00:13:06,439<br>So I’ve got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 different entries in the table. And I’m going to populate</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:06,439 –&gt; 00:13:16,759<br>them on this tri right here. Because the matching of an incoming address is going to have variable length,</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:16,759 –&gt; 00:13:22,599<br>we need a data structure to hold variable length entries. So the way that this data structure holds</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:22,680 –&gt; 00:13:31,720<br>these entries is let’s take the 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, this is 0, this is 0, this is 0, this is 0, and then this</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:31,720 –&gt; 00:13:37,240<br>is 1. In other words, we take the left branch for 0 and the right branch for 1. And so we encode or</p>
<p>146<br>00:13:37,240 –&gt; 00:13:43,480<br>store this entry A, this particular leaf corresponding to that entry. And suddenly at the other extreme,</p>
<p>147<br>00:13:43,560 –&gt; 00:13:53,399<br>let’s take a look at J, that’s 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 corresponding to this entry here. And this is</p>
<p>148<br>00:13:53,399 –&gt; 00:13:59,080<br>where we’ll find J at the leaf. Once we’ve got this data structure for storing the entries, when a</p>
<p>149<br>00:13:59,080 –&gt; 00:14:04,200<br>packet comes in with a particular destination address, we can just do a bit by bit comparison,</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:04,200 –&gt; 00:14:10,279<br>traverse this tree, and it will tell us which entry is the longest matching prefix. If we get to</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:10,279 –&gt; 00:14:15,000<br>a leaf and find that there’s nothing there, we go back to the nearest matching one that shared</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:15,000 –&gt; 00:14:19,319<br>bits in common with that address. You might want to experiment with this with these other entries</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:19,319 –&gt; 00:14:26,600<br>in the table. So this is one common way of storing and performing the look up for a longest matching</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:26,600 –&gt; 00:14:31,799<br>prefix. And there’s another entry, another mechanism, which is quite commonly used to, that’s to</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:31,799 –&gt; 00:14:39,319<br>use a special type of memory device called a tenery content addressable memory or a Tcam. And a Tcam,</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:39,480 –&gt; 00:14:46,440<br>that is the table again that we had before. And we start by storing it in a slightly different</p>
<p>157<br>00:14:46,440 –&gt; 00:14:54,600<br>representation in the table. So entry A would be stored as for 0’s and a 1. And here we’ve rounded</p>
<p>158<br>00:14:54,600 –&gt; 00:15:02,360<br>everything out to 8 bits as if the 8 bit prefixes. And this mask value here is telling us which</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:02,360 –&gt; 00:15:09,240<br>bits in the value above actually matter. So wherever there was a 0 or 1, we put a 1 to say these</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:09,240 –&gt; 00:15:16,120<br>are all valid. And wherever we have an x, we put a 0. So these two bits, these two representations</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:16,120 –&gt; 00:15:21,080<br>here, we can either think of them as a ternary value or two binary values that are storing this entry.</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:21,080 –&gt; 00:15:27,159<br>They tell us which bits have which values and which ones don’t matter. So the process of performing</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:27,159 –&gt; 00:15:33,399<br>a look up is kind of brute force. We can pair an incoming address against every masked entry at</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:33,399 –&gt; 00:15:39,480<br>the same time in parallel on the table. So these specialized members consume quite a bit of</p>
<p>165<br>00:15:39,480 –&gt; 00:15:42,919<br>power because they’re doing all of that at the same time. But they can be really, really fast.</p>
<p>166<br>00:15:42,919 –&gt; 00:15:47,399<br>And so they’re quite commonly used for doing longest prefix matches in routers.</p>
<p>167<br>00:15:48,600 –&gt; 00:15:52,919<br>One of the last things I wanted to point out is there’s sort of an increasing interest these days in</p>
<p>168<br>00:15:53,480 –&gt; 00:15:59,240<br>what we might call generic look ups. You know, I made the observation before that these tables are</p>
<p>169<br>00:15:59,240 –&gt; 00:16:06,360<br>holding a match field and an action field. And so we can generalize this or abstract this and say</p>
<p>170<br>00:16:06,360 –&gt; 00:16:12,360<br>pretty much any packet switch is doing a look up which is a match followed by an action. And the</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:12,360 –&gt; 00:16:18,440<br>match might be on any fields like an IP address or Ethernet destination address and an IP address if</p>
<p>172<br>00:16:18,440 –&gt; 00:16:24,519<br>we wanted. And we might have actions like forward or drop or encapsulate or do other things. So we can</p>
<p>173<br>00:16:24,519 –&gt; 00:16:30,840<br>generalize the specification of a packet switch. And nowadays packets which is a design that can do</p>
<p>174<br>00:16:30,840 –&gt; 00:16:36,759<br>all sorts of different types of forwarding for layer two, layer three at the same time or they could be</p>
<p>175<br>00:16:37,319 –&gt; 00:16:43,799<br>they could be for for things like switches routers, firewalls, all sorts of devices like that.</p>
<p>176<br>00:16:43,799 –&gt; 00:16:49,399<br>So in summary, packets which is performed two basic operations. They perform the look ups for</p>
<p>177<br>00:16:49,399 –&gt; 00:16:54,600<br>looking up addresses in a forwarding table and then they switch the packet to the correct outgoing port.</p>
<p>178<br>00:16:55,480 –&gt; 00:16:59,559<br>At high level Ethernet switches and internet routers perform very similar operations. They’re</p>
<p>179<br>00:16:59,559 –&gt; 00:17:06,039<br>basically processing these packets in a very similar way. Address look up is different in switches</p>
<p>180<br>00:17:06,039 –&gt; 00:17:11,480<br>and routers and we saw some examples of those for both Ethernet addresses and IP addresses.</p>
