                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,000<br>This video is a continuation of our first video on how packet switches work.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,000<br>In the first video we saw that there are two basic operations to a packet switch.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,000 –&gt; 00:00:12,000<br>First, packet addresses have to be looked up into a forwarding table,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,000 –&gt; 00:00:18,000<br>and then the packet has to be switched or transferred to the correct output port</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:18,000 –&gt; 00:00:20,000<br>so that it could be sent under the correct outgoing link.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:20,000 –&gt; 00:00:26,000<br>In the last video we saw how addresses are looked up in tables for Ethernet switches and Internet routers,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:26,000 –&gt; 00:00:30,000<br>and in this video I’m going to explain how packets are switched to the correct egress port.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:30,000 –&gt; 00:00:34,000<br>I’m going to look at a number of different techniques, output queuing, input queuing, and virtual output queues.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:34,000 –&gt; 00:00:40,000<br>We’ll see and get a sense for how these packet switches are actually built.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:42,000 –&gt; 00:00:48,000<br>I’m going to start with the basic vanilla switch, which is the one I showed you before.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,000 –&gt; 00:00:52,000<br>We have the address look up on the left over here,</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:52,000 –&gt; 00:00:56,000<br>and then on the, this is the forwarding table where we look up the addresses,</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:56,000 –&gt; 00:01:02,000<br>and then we have the packet queuing logic and then the buffer memory where the packets are held</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:02,000 –&gt; 00:01:04,000<br>during times of congestion.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:04,000 –&gt; 00:01:10,000<br>When packets arrive, here are three packets arriving with different egress ports</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:10,000 –&gt; 00:01:12,000<br>indicated by the color of the head of the packet.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:12,000 –&gt; 00:01:18,000<br>So the red one at the top is going to the red port over here, the one in the middle.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:18,000 –&gt; 00:01:26,000<br>So when these packets traverse the back plane, we see that the blue one is able to go to its output.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:26,000 –&gt; 00:01:32,000<br>One of the red ones can be delivered immediately, and the other one is held in the output queue waiting for its turn.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:32,000 –&gt; 00:01:40,000<br>So as soon as the first two have left, this one can then depart in FIFO order.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:40,000 –&gt; 00:01:46,000<br>We often refer to a switch like this as an output queued switch, because the queues are at the output.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:46,000 –&gt; 00:01:50,000<br>And this has a certain ramification for the performance of the switch.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:50,000 –&gt; 00:01:52,000<br>Let’s take a look at that.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:52,000 –&gt; 00:02:00,000<br>When we have packets arriving, it’s possible in the worst case that all the packets coming in at the same time from the outside</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:00,000 –&gt; 00:02:04,000<br>will be wanting to go to the same output queue.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:04,000 –&gt; 00:02:06,000<br>Let’s say this one here.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:06,000 –&gt; 00:02:12,000<br>So if we have n ports, each running at rate are, and there are, let’s say there are n of them,</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:12,000 –&gt; 00:02:20,000<br>then in the worst case, we could actually have a writing rate of n times r into this output queue.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:20,000 –&gt; 00:02:26,000<br>Similarly, we always have a reading rate from this queue of rate r.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:26,000 –&gt; 00:02:36,000<br>So we say in the output queued switch that this memory must run an aggregate, a total rate of up to n plus 1 times r.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:36,000 –&gt; 00:02:46,000<br>The so-and-enoying thing or frustrating thing about this is that long term, it can’t possibly be the case that we’re writing into this queue at rate n times r.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:46,000 –&gt; 00:02:48,000<br>The system could not sustain that.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:48,000 –&gt; 00:02:58,000<br>This only really works if some mechanism is at play like congestion control to hold the average rate of writing into this queue at no more than 1 r.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:58,000 –&gt; 00:03:04,000<br>So it feels as though the maximum rate that we should need is 2 times r.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:04,000 –&gt; 00:03:06,000<br>That was what we would strive for.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:06,000 –&gt; 00:03:08,000<br>Unfortunately, you’re paying this penalty of n.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:08,000 –&gt; 00:03:12,000<br>An n could be a large number. It could be hundreds or even thousands.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:12,000 –&gt; 00:03:14,000<br>So this memory has to run much faster.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:14,000 –&gt; 00:03:24,000<br>Output queued switches are said to be limited by this problem that they have to have memories that run very, very fast.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:24,000 –&gt; 00:03:36,000<br>It becomes quite a challenge when building scalable output queued switches to find or use memories or create a memory hierarchy that will run fast enough.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:36,000 –&gt; 00:03:42,000<br>One obvious way to solve this problem is to move the queues from the output over to the input.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:42,000 –&gt; 00:03:44,000<br>Let’s take a look at what happens when we do this.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:44,000 –&gt; 00:03:48,000<br>For obvious reason we call this an input queued packet switch.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:48,000 –&gt; 00:03:54,000<br>Now the queues where packets will be held are at the input side of the switch.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:54,000 –&gt; 00:04:02,000<br>The advantage of this will perhaps be obvious in a moment if we consider packets arriving to the switch.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:02,000 –&gt; 00:04:06,000<br>Same pattern as before. Two reds, one blue.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:06,000 –&gt; 00:04:10,000<br>In this case, what we would do is all of the packets would come through the switch.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:10,000 –&gt; 00:04:14,000<br>Only one of them needs to be held. That’s the one down here.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:14,000 –&gt; 00:04:20,000<br>Waiting for its turn to go across the switch. That’s because its output line is busy and there’s no queue at the output to hold it.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:20,000 –&gt; 00:04:22,000<br>So we hold it back at the input.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:22,000 –&gt; 00:04:26,000<br>Later, when its turn comes, it can depart just like it would from an output queued.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:26,000 –&gt; 00:04:28,000<br>So it’s showing the face of it.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:28,000 –&gt; 00:04:32,000<br>The good news is that things look like they work the same.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:32,000 –&gt; 00:04:41,000<br>The better news is that the buffer memory here is now only has to accept one packet, at most one packet from the ingress at a time.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:41,000 –&gt; 00:04:47,000<br>It has to only send one packet into the switch in a packet time.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:47,000 –&gt; 00:04:55,000<br>So its speed has been reduced from n plus one times r just down to our minimum and our goal, which was two times r.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:55,000 –&gt; 00:04:58,000<br>So a factor of almost n reduction.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:58,000 –&gt; 00:05:00,000<br>So this makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:00,000 –&gt; 00:05:04,000<br>For this reason, people often say that input queued switches are much more scalable.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:04,000 –&gt; 00:05:08,000<br>Quite a few big switches made this way, but with a caveat.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:08,000 –&gt; 00:05:13,000<br>And there is a problem that we’re going to have a take a look at right now.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:13,000 –&gt; 00:05:17,000<br>In an input queued switch, the problem is something called head of line blocking.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:17,000 –&gt; 00:05:20,000<br>And this problem is something that you’ll see in many contacts.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:20,000 –&gt; 00:05:25,000<br>I want to explain it here. So you’ll recognize it when you see it in other environments.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:25,000 –&gt; 00:05:27,000<br>Let me go through an example.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:27,000 –&gt; 00:05:32,000<br>These are three inputs representing the inputs of the switch.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:32,000 –&gt; 00:05:38,000<br>So these are the input buffers. I’ve taken away everything else on the switch just to make it a little bit clearer.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:38,000 –&gt; 00:05:43,000<br>And we’re going to see packets arrive to these. Here they are.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:43,000 –&gt; 00:05:49,000<br>They’re red ones going to the red output, black ones to the black output, green ones to the green output.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:49,000 –&gt; 00:05:55,000<br>And imagine that you have the task of deciding which packets to go.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:55,000 –&gt; 00:05:59,000<br>And you look at the packets at the head of line of this and see that they’re all red.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:59,000 –&gt; 00:06:03,000<br>The problem is that you could only send one of them at a time.</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:03,000 –&gt; 00:06:08,000<br>And so in this particular instance, we’d only be able to send the red one.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:08,000 –&gt; 00:06:15,000<br>Even though there are green and black packets in the system that could go to these unused outputs,</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:15,000 –&gt; 00:06:22,000<br>because we’ve arranged everything as a single queue, we get this head of line blocking effect.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:22,000 –&gt; 00:06:27,000<br>Natural solution to this, which is pretty widely used, is something called virtual output queues,</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:27,000 –&gt; 00:06:32,000<br>where each input maintains a separate queue for each output.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:32,000 –&gt; 00:06:44,000<br>So in this case, we have a 3x3 switch. So this queue here is a 5.0 queue of packets waiting to go to output 1, the red output, for output 2 and for output 3.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:44,000 –&gt; 00:06:49,000<br>So when packets arrive, they’re the same set of packets arriving as before.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:49,000 –&gt; 00:06:54,000<br>But now they get pre-classified and placed into a queue corresponding the output they’re going to.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:54,000 –&gt; 00:07:00,000<br>That’s why we call them virtual output queues. It’s a queue of packets going to the all going to the same output.</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:00,000 –&gt; 00:07:05,000<br>The good news now is that because each queue holds packets going to the same output,</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:05,000 –&gt; 00:07:10,000<br>no packet can be held up by a packet ahead of it going to a different output.</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:10,000 –&gt; 00:07:17,000<br>So it can’t be held up because its head of line is blocked by someone who is stuck.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:17,000 –&gt; 00:07:24,000<br>So now we can look at this and say, aha, we have visibility into all of the head of line packets,</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:24,000 –&gt; 00:07:29,000<br>and we can deliver all three in one go and therefore get a higher instantaneous throughput.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:29,000 –&gt; 00:07:34,000<br>It’s an obvious solution. It can be a little tricky to implement in practice.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:34,000 –&gt; 00:07:38,000<br>But the nice thing is that it overcomes this head of line blocking entirely.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:38,000 –&gt; 00:07:46,000<br>So the good news overall is we’ve reduced the speed of the queues to two times our speed of the memories,</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:46,000 –&gt; 00:07:51,000<br>because remember we can only have one packet come in at a time and only one packet departed at a time.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:51,000 –&gt; 00:07:57,000<br>And we’re able to sustain the same throughput performance as before.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:57,000 –&gt; 00:08:00,000<br>Just to look at this on a graph, we often see graphs that look like this.</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:00,000 –&gt; 00:08:08,000<br>This is a plot of the delay or the average delay that a packet would experience as a function of the load.</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:08,000 –&gt; 00:08:12,000<br>This is basically how busy the ingress lines are.</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:12,000 –&gt; 00:08:17,000<br>The best that any queuing system can achieve is this line here.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:17,000 –&gt; 00:08:27,000<br>And this corresponds to a system in which as the load approaches 100%, the delay increases or the average delay increases and is asymptotic to 100%.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:27,000 –&gt; 00:08:31,000<br>In fact, this is what we will see with an output queued switch.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:31,000 –&gt; 00:08:41,000<br>An output queued switch is perfect in the sense that you can’t achieve a higher throughput or you can’t achieve a low average delay.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:41,000 –&gt; 00:08:45,000<br>Let’s take a look at the main properties of output queued switches.</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:45,000 –&gt; 00:08:47,000<br>First we say they are work conserving.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:47,000 –&gt; 00:08:54,000<br>Work conserving means that an output line is never idle when there is a packet in the system waiting to go to it.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:54,000 –&gt; 00:08:59,000<br>That means there’s no blocking internally preventing a packet getting to that line.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:59,000 –&gt; 00:09:04,000<br>Whenever that line is idle, there is no packet in the system waiting for it.</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:05,000 –&gt; 00:09:13,000<br>As a consequence, throughput is maximized because you cannot have a higher throughput than keeping all the lines busy whenever there is a packet available for them.</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:13,000 –&gt; 00:09:21,000<br>And the expected delay is minimized because we are always doing useful work delivering packets under the outgoing line.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:21,000 –&gt; 00:09:29,000<br>Just to recap the performance that we suffer from with head of line blocking, this was our perfect output switch, output queued switch here on the right.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:29,000 –&gt; 00:09:44,000<br>We have a nice performance here. With head of line blocking, it is a well known result that the throughput can be reduced in other words, this asymptote when things fall apart gets reduced to 2 minus square root of 2 or approximately 58%.</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:44,000 –&gt; 00:09:49,000<br>We lose almost half the performance of the system as a consequence of this head of line blocking.</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:49,000 –&gt; 00:09:56,000<br>The actual number will vary depending on the particular arrival pattern but in general it is pretty bad news.</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:57,000 –&gt; 00:10:06,000<br>But if we use virtual output queues, this 58% gets pushed back up again to the full 100% of the system.</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:06,000 –&gt; 00:10:12,000<br>It doesn’t entirely match the output queued switch, the asymptote will still be 100% over here.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:12,000 –&gt; 00:10:20,000<br>Actually with virtual output queues, the delay will be slightly higher but the asymptote is to 100%.</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:20,000 –&gt; 00:10:24,000<br>I’d like to say a few last words about virtual output queues.</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:24,000 –&gt; 00:10:30,000<br>Virtual output queues are actually used very widely and you may even have noticed them when driving on the street.</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:30,000 –&gt; 00:10:37,000<br>So in the US where we drive on the right, it’s very common to have a left hand turn lane like the one that’s shown here.</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:37,000 –&gt; 00:10:45,000<br>This is to hold cars that are arriving and that are blocked because of cars coming the other way.</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:45,000 –&gt; 00:10:49,000<br>These ones are blocked and can’t turn left until there’s nothing coming the other way.</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:49,000 –&gt; 00:10:54,000<br>However, cars in this lane here can keep going straight on or can turn right.</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:54,000 –&gt; 00:11:03,000<br>They are not held up or blocked because of a packet ahead of it going to an output that in this case over here which is temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:03,000 –&gt; 00:11:09,000<br>So in countries where you drive on the left hand side then a right hand turn lane is quite common as well.</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:09,000 –&gt; 00:11:14,000<br>So next time you’re driving and you see one of these, just remember this is virtual output queuing.</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:15,000 –&gt; 00:11:19,000<br>So in summary we’ve seen that packet switches perform two basic operations.</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:19,000 –&gt; 00:11:26,000<br>They look up addresses in a forwarding table. We saw examples of that in the last video for Ethernet switches and for Internet routers.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:26,000 –&gt; 00:11:30,000<br>And they also once they’re decided where a packet is going they have to switch it.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:30,000 –&gt; 00:11:35,000<br>They have to deliver it to the correct egress port so it can go under the correct output link.</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:35,000 –&gt; 00:11:42,000<br>The simplest and slower switch is use output queuing because this maximizes the throughput and minimizes the expected delay of packets.</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:42,000 –&gt; 00:11:50,000<br>Whereas more scalable switches often use input queues with virtual output queues to maximize the throughput.</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:50,000 –&gt; 00:11:53,000<br>That’s the end of this video.</p>
