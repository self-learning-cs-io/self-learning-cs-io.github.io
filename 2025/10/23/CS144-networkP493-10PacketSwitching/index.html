                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,879<br>In this video I’m going to continue the description of packet switching and in</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,879 –&gt; 00:00:08,900<br>particular I’m going to tell you about how we can guarantee delays from one end of</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,900 –&gt; 00:00:12,300<br>a network to another. This may come as a bit of a surprise because in earlier</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,300 –&gt; 00:00:17,080<br>videos I was telling about how the queuing delay is variable and so we</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:17,080 –&gt; 00:00:20,960<br>generally cannot control the delay through the network. But we’re going to use</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:20,960 –&gt; 00:00:24,879<br>special techniques that rely on the weighted fair queuing that we learned in the</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:24,879 –&gt; 00:00:30,239<br>rate guarantee video so you should make sure you watch that one first. Let me</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:30,239 –&gt; 00:00:34,479<br>start with giving us some intuition on how delay guarantees are going to work.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:34,479 –&gt; 00:00:40,640<br>So recall our end-to-end delay equation which tells us the delay from one end of</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:40,640 –&gt; 00:00:46,560<br>the network to the other as a function of the packetization delay that is the</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,560 –&gt; 00:00:52,599<br>fixed component of the packet length divided by the rate plus the propagation</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:52,600 –&gt; 00:00:57,480<br>delay which is the length of the link divided by the propagation delay or the</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:57,480 –&gt; 00:01:03,120<br>speed of light plus the queuing delay. And the first two terms are defined as</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:03,120 –&gt; 00:01:08,519<br>fixed functions of the network. They depend on things under our control.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,519 –&gt; 00:01:12,840<br>Normally the queuing delay is not under our control. So if we want to provide an</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,840 –&gt; 00:01:17,159<br>end-to-end delay guarantee then we’re going to have to provide a delay for the queue</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:17,159 –&gt; 00:01:23,519<br>through every router along the path. Okay so the basic idea is if we know the</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:23,519 –&gt; 00:01:28,840<br>upper bound on Q1, Q2 and Q3 then we know the upper bound of the end-to-end delay</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,840 –&gt; 00:01:36,640<br>over all from this equation. So how do we do that? So if in a router I know which</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:36,640 –&gt; 00:01:43,439<br>queues a packet passes through and I know the size of the buffer. So let’s say</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,439 –&gt; 00:01:48,359<br>I’m looking at packets that are going to go through this queue here inside the</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:48,359 –&gt; 00:01:53,759<br>router. I know the size of the buffer it’s going to go through and I know the rate at</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:53,759 –&gt; 00:01:58,000<br>which that buffer is going to be served. Then I know the maximum delay that a</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:58,000 –&gt; 00:02:04,200<br>packet can encounter through this router because WFQ, weighted for queuing that</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:04,200 –&gt; 00:02:11,079<br>we saw in the in the rate guarantee video, gives me a rate R1 and then I can</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:11,080 –&gt; 00:02:15,560<br>simply say that the delay through this router will be bounded by the size of the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:15,560 –&gt; 00:02:24,600<br>buffer divided by R1, the rate that it achieved. So and remember that R1 equals the</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:24,600 –&gt; 00:02:29,800<br>weight that I was going to give to that first one divided by the sum of all the</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:29,800 –&gt; 00:02:39,400<br>weights times R. So I can control R R1, I can pick a B therefore I can pick the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:39,400 –&gt; 00:02:44,960<br>delay through the router. How do I actually do this in practice? Let’s take a</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:44,960 –&gt; 00:02:50,719<br>look at that. So we can control the delay of the packets from things that we</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:50,719 –&gt; 00:02:54,680<br>already know. What we already know how to control is the rate at which a queue is</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:54,680 –&gt; 00:03:01,759<br>served using WFQ and the size of each queue. This suggests a model for a router</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:01,759 –&gt; 00:03:06,960<br>where we classify the packets as they come in. So this is the arriving packets</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:06,960 –&gt; 00:03:11,040<br>and I’m going to classify them. I’m going to decide the flow to which they</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:11,040 –&gt; 00:03:16,400<br>belong and then I’m going to stick them into that queue. So if they had gone into</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:16,400 –&gt; 00:03:19,640<br>another queue down here that might have been possible which is going to be</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:19,640 –&gt; 00:03:25,640<br>serviced at that rate R1 and this one would be at rate Rn and then they’re going</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:25,640 –&gt; 00:03:33,360<br>to come together and go under the outgoing line of rate R. So if I can set this</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:33,360 –&gt; 00:03:37,000<br>at the correct rate I can set the size of the buffer then I can control the</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:37,000 –&gt; 00:03:40,960<br>delay. Any packing packet arriving to the router will have a bounded delay and</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:40,960 –&gt; 00:03:44,320<br>if we add up all the components of delay correctly using our equation then we</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:44,320 –&gt; 00:03:48,720<br>can make it work end-to-end according to what we know. This works for packets</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:48,720 –&gt; 00:03:55,480<br>that make it all the way through but here’s the problem. What if a packet</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:55,480 –&gt; 00:04:00,960<br>arrives at such a rate that it overflows the buffer here and falls under the</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:00,960 –&gt; 00:04:05,280<br>ground in other words that we fill up this buffer just because of the arrival</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:05,280 –&gt; 00:04:09,480<br>process to this queue. So this is really the remaining problem that we have to</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:09,480 –&gt; 00:04:12,719<br>solve because there’s no point in having an end-to-end delay guarantee if</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:12,719 –&gt; 00:04:15,600<br>packets are going to get dropped along the way that’s not really a delay</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:15,600 –&gt; 00:04:20,560<br>guarantee. So we need to figure out how we can how we can prevent that buffer</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:20,560 –&gt; 00:04:24,160<br>from overflowing and if we can do this then we’ve we’ve solved our overall</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:24,160 –&gt; 00:04:30,560<br>problem. So how do we make sure that no packets are dropped? So we’re going to</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:30,560 –&gt; 00:04:34,360<br>zoom in on one queue and take a look at this and we’re going to go back to</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:34,360 –&gt; 00:04:40,839<br>something that we saw before which was our our our simple deterministic model of</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:40,839 –&gt; 00:04:45,720<br>the dynamics of a queue. So you’ll remember that we had for a queue like this we</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:45,720 –&gt; 00:04:53,840<br>could model it as the cumulative bytes so cumulative bits or bytes. Actually I’ll</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:53,840 –&gt; 00:04:57,800<br>I’ll say bits because it’s going to make it a little easier to explain as a</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:57,800 –&gt; 00:05:04,199<br>function of time. So this is the time evolution and you remember that we that we</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:04,199 –&gt; 00:05:09,240<br>said we have the cumulative arrival process which might look something like</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:09,240 –&gt; 00:05:15,040<br>this and then we’re going to have the cumulative departure process which is</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:15,040 –&gt; 00:05:18,800<br>going to be the times at which the queue is empty. We’re going to serve it at</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:18,800 –&gt; 00:05:23,280<br>some fixed rate and then it’ll pause until there’s there’s enough accumulated</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:23,280 –&gt; 00:05:27,720<br>some accumulated and then so on and then it’ll pause and so the rate at this</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:27,720 –&gt; 00:05:33,440<br>point is slightly less than the arrival rate. So here we have a of t the</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:33,440 –&gt; 00:05:38,760<br>arrival process, the cumulative arrival process and here we have d of t the</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:38,760 –&gt; 00:05:43,440<br>cumulative departure process. And you remember that if we were interested in in</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:43,440 –&gt; 00:05:47,600<br>the delay of individual packets through this queue or in this case individual</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:47,600 –&gt; 00:05:53,520<br>bits we take the horizontal distance. This is the time that a bit arrived. This</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:53,519 –&gt; 00:05:59,279<br>is the time that that bit departed because it’s a 5.0 queue that we have. Then the</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:59,279 –&gt; 00:06:06,199<br>little d of t the delay is simply the horizontal distance and the maximum size</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:06,199 –&gt; 00:06:10,479<br>of the buffer that we need is the maximum horizontal distance between these two</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:10,479 –&gt; 00:06:13,560<br>lines because that’s the maximum distance between what’s arrived and what’s</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:13,560 –&gt; 00:06:22,439<br>departed. So if that vertical distance grows too big, grows to larger than b. So</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:22,439 –&gt; 00:06:26,560<br>this here is queue of t right the amount that we have in the queue at only one</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:26,560 –&gt; 00:06:32,600<br>time. If queue of t grows to be greater than or equal to b then we’re going to have</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:32,600 –&gt; 00:06:36,100<br>packets that are going to get dropped onto the floor. How do we going to make</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:36,100 –&gt; 00:06:40,360<br>sure that this doesn’t happen? This is what we’re going to look at next and as I</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:40,360 –&gt; 00:06:43,600<br>said if we can solve this then we can provide the delay guarantee through the</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:43,600 –&gt; 00:06:48,519<br>router that we’re looking for. The way that we’re going to approach it is as</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:48,519 –&gt; 00:06:58,519<br>follows. I’m going to resketch this this deterministic queue model. So this is</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:58,519 –&gt; 00:07:04,079<br>this is our and I’m going to focus now just on the arrival process. So this is a</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:04,079 –&gt; 00:07:10,199<br>accumulative arrival process a of t. It just needs to be non-decreasing to be</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:10,199 –&gt; 00:07:18,479<br>plausible. And we’re going to say that in any time interval so in any time</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:18,480 –&gt; 00:07:24,240<br>interval let’s take a time interval like this. If we can guarantee that no more</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:24,240 –&gt; 00:07:36,040<br>than b plus r1 times t where t is the time interval we can say that no more than</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:36,040 –&gt; 00:07:44,879<br>b plus r1 time t bits arrive then the buffer can’t possibly overflow. So this</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:44,879 –&gt; 00:07:50,079<br>would be over any time interval t because we know it’s being drained at rate r1</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:50,079 –&gt; 00:07:54,079<br>so r1 times t will have departed. We just need to make sure that we have an</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:54,079 –&gt; 00:07:58,680<br>accumulated more than b in any time interval. So if we make this t any value and</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:58,680 –&gt; 00:08:05,000<br>we never violate this then we can be sure that we’ve never overflowed the queue.</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:05,500 –&gt; 00:08:15,560<br>So in other words a of t at the time t plus capital T minus the occupancy or</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:15,560 –&gt; 00:08:20,399<br>the cumulative arrivals at time little t is less than or equal to this</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:20,399 –&gt; 00:08:29,639<br>expression here b plus r1 times t. So if we can make sure that this guarantee is</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:29,639 –&gt; 00:08:37,840<br>met and in other words this expression defined here is met. Then the queue</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:37,840 –&gt; 00:08:41,480<br>will never overflow so we know the delay is guaranteed because we’re serving at</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:41,480 –&gt; 00:08:47,279<br>rate r1 and we’ve given quite a lot of leeway to the arrival process a of t.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:47,279 –&gt; 00:08:52,279<br>We’ve constrained it to make sure that it must fit within this requirement that</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:52,279 –&gt; 00:08:56,960<br>in this time frame no more than b plus r1 t but we’ve given it some leeway on</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:56,960 –&gt; 00:09:02,080<br>how it accomplishes this. So let’s look at this in a bit more in a bit more</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:02,080 –&gt; 00:09:08,480<br>detail. We’re going to constrain the traffic and we’re going to use a fairly</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:08,480 –&gt; 00:09:12,600<br>well-known technique for doing this. There’s something that’s called sigma row</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:12,600 –&gt; 00:09:16,560<br>regulation. I’ll tell you what sigma row regulation is. It’s basically the idea</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:16,560 –&gt; 00:09:21,920<br>I just I just told you. So if this blue squiggly line here is our rival</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:21,919 –&gt; 00:09:27,319<br>process, our cumulative arrival process a of t, I’m going to say that the number</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:27,319 –&gt; 00:09:33,199<br>of bits that can arrive in any period of length t is bounded plus by sigma plus</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:33,199 –&gt; 00:09:40,159<br>root t. So this is just like my b plus r1 t equation just now. We can think of</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:40,159 –&gt; 00:09:47,120<br>this as in any time that we can draw that sigma plus r, sigma plus r, t by this</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:47,120 –&gt; 00:09:52,759<br>blue line here. And we could start it at any point and you can see that it’s</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:52,759 –&gt; 00:09:57,639<br>basically saying that if we touch it down on any point of a of t, a of t in the</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:57,639 –&gt; 00:10:03,080<br>future must lie below that line. So wherever we start wherever we slide this it</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:03,080 –&gt; 00:10:08,320<br>must always lie, the a of t must always lie underneath it. If that is true then</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:08,320 –&gt; 00:10:16,480<br>this equation holds and we say that a of t is sigma row regulated. You can see</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:16,480 –&gt; 00:10:20,879<br>that a of t has quite a lot of leeway on how it fits under that. It just was never</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:20,879 –&gt; 00:10:25,440<br>exceed it starting from any one point. So in our example sigma equals b and</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:25,440 –&gt; 00:10:29,480<br>row equals r1. And the only reason I’m telling about sigma row regulation is that</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:29,480 –&gt; 00:10:33,560<br>you’ll find it commonly described in textbooks as sigma row regulation. And in</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:33,560 –&gt; 00:10:40,519<br>our example I just happen to use b and r1 for the qi was looking at. Okay to</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:40,519 –&gt; 00:10:45,399<br>reiterate this point then if I’ve got sigma row constrained arrivals and a</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:45,399 –&gt; 00:10:49,840<br>minimum service rate. So my minimum service rate here is r1 that’s the</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:49,840 –&gt; 00:10:55,959<br>rate at which the q is being served. I’ve got a cumulative arrival process here,</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:55,959 –&gt; 00:11:02,559<br>the green blue line, and then the departure process here the red line. And I’m</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:02,559 –&gt; 00:11:08,319<br>going to constrain a of t to always lie below this sigma row line, the sigma</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:08,319 –&gt; 00:11:14,840<br>plus row t line. Remember that this constraint must be held for all times</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:14,840 –&gt; 00:11:19,160<br>wherever I start the sigma plus row t. So if I slide it along, for example</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:19,160 –&gt; 00:11:23,759<br>starting here and starting here, it must be true on all of those occasions. But</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:23,759 –&gt; 00:11:28,560<br>if I do that then I know that the the distance between a of t and d of t is</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:28,560 –&gt; 00:11:35,160<br>less than the distance between this blue line and d of t. And so therefore I can</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:35,160 –&gt; 00:11:40,720<br>constrain both b max. That’s the maximum q occupancy I need to never overflow.</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:40,720 –&gt; 00:11:48,320<br>And d max the maximum delay of any bit through the q. So in summary for no</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:48,320 –&gt; 00:11:53,080<br>packet loss I need that b is greater than or equal to sigma. And if the rate at</p>
<p>131<br>00:11:53,080 –&gt; 00:11:58,120<br>which I’m serving is greater than this row then the delay is less than or equal</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:58,120 –&gt; 00:12:02,800<br>to b over r1. So I’ve now bounded the delay based on things that I can control</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:02,800 –&gt; 00:12:09,440<br>b and r1. Still doesn’t tell me how I’m going to do this. It just tells me that</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:09,440 –&gt; 00:12:14,520<br>if I can constrain d of t then this will all hold. And so what I’m going to tell</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:14,520 –&gt; 00:12:19,320<br>you next is it and describe this that if the flows are what we’re going to call</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:19,320 –&gt; 00:12:24,080<br>leaky bucket constrained and the routers use weighted for queuing then end-to-end</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:24,080 –&gt; 00:12:28,960<br>delay guarantees are possible. So what is this leaky bucket constrained? Well it</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:28,960 –&gt; 00:12:32,960<br>turns out the leaky bucket is something that implements the sigma row</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:32,960 –&gt; 00:12:37,880<br>regulator and therefore makes all of this work. Let’s take a look at what that</p>
<p>140<br>00:12:37,879 –&gt; 00:12:43,720<br>leaky bucket is. So the leaky bucket regulator looks like this. Packets are</p>
<p>141<br>00:12:43,720 –&gt; 00:12:48,000<br>going to arrive. So here are my packets arriving here and they’re going to go into</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:48,000 –&gt; 00:12:52,559<br>the packet buffer. And the rule is that I can send or I can take packets out of</p>
<p>143<br>00:12:52,559 –&gt; 00:12:58,919<br>the buffer only if there are enough tokens and the tokens are being made</p>
<p>144<br>00:12:58,919 –&gt; 00:13:04,639<br>available here at a particular rate row and the token bucket size is of sigma.</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:04,639 –&gt; 00:13:08,240<br>So the tokens here are just a scheduling mechanism. The tokens don’t go out</p>
<p>146<br>00:13:08,240 –&gt; 00:13:13,919<br>under the wire. This token bucket is just a way of holding and implementing the</p>
<p>147<br>00:13:13,919 –&gt; 00:13:18,039<br>scheduling mechanism that constrains the traffic. So this is something we’re going</p>
<p>148<br>00:13:18,039 –&gt; 00:13:22,279<br>to do at the source at a when it’s sending the packets under the line. We’re going</p>
<p>149<br>00:13:22,279 –&gt; 00:13:25,840<br>to make sure that they are sigma row constrained using the leaky bucket</p>
<p>150<br>00:13:25,840 –&gt; 00:13:30,960<br>regulator. It can send them under the wire if and only if there are enough</p>
<p>151<br>00:13:30,960 –&gt; 00:13:37,720<br>tokens in its bucket. So it’s going to accumulate a rate row with burst in a</p>
<p>152<br>00:13:37,720 –&gt; 00:13:41,200<br>sigma. And in other words the maximum that it can have in that bucket is sigma.</p>
<p>153<br>00:13:41,200 –&gt; 00:13:45,360<br>And then it will send a packet if there are sufficient tokens that allow to send</p>
<p>154<br>00:13:45,360 –&gt; 00:13:49,560<br>a packet of that size. So if the tokens are in bits they don’t have enough</p>
<p>155<br>00:13:49,560 –&gt; 00:13:53,680<br>tokens to represent the packet that you’re trying to send. And as soon as you</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:53,680 –&gt; 00:13:57,560<br>send them then you use up the tokens and you put away for more to be to be put</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:57,559 –&gt; 00:14:01,319<br>in. And you can probably see how this will make sure that we’re allowing for</p>
<p>158<br>00:14:01,319 –&gt; 00:14:07,399<br>bursts of up to sigma. But over on the long term rate is only row. And so they’ll</p>
<p>159<br>00:14:07,399 –&gt; 00:14:11,479<br>meet the constraint that we want. So putting it all together then what have we</p>
<p>160<br>00:14:11,479 –&gt; 00:14:18,959<br>got? We have a sigma row constrained traffic here. So this would be our sigma</p>
<p>161<br>00:14:18,959 –&gt; 00:14:24,519<br>row constrained traffic going in that’s coming out of our leaky bucket at</p>
<p>162<br>00:14:24,519 –&gt; 00:14:32,120<br>at a. Each each router is going to run WFQ waited for queuing in order to make</p>
<p>163<br>00:14:32,120 –&gt; 00:14:37,919<br>sure that we get a service rate of R1 for that particular flow and a buffer</p>
<p>164<br>00:14:37,919 –&gt; 00:14:42,879<br>size of at least the B that we need. And that will be at each one. So we’ll have R2</p>
<p>165<br>00:14:42,879 –&gt; 00:14:49,960<br>here and B. And along the path we’re going to take the packets and make sure</p>
<p>166<br>00:14:49,960 –&gt; 00:14:53,840<br>they’re going into the correct queue that is being serviced at that rate. So we</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:53,840 –&gt; 00:14:57,280<br>call that packet classification to put it into the correct queue and then</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:57,280 –&gt; 00:15:00,440<br>eventually it will find its way.</p>
<p>169<br>00:15:03,560 –&gt; 00:15:09,160<br>Then we can use our equation for end to end delay in order to calculate the</p>
<p>170<br>00:15:09,160 –&gt; 00:15:15,560<br>entire delay along the path. So you may be wondering how are these values of</p>
<p>171<br>00:15:15,560 –&gt; 00:15:23,600<br>sigma and row and the values of R1 and B and R2 and B get told to the routers</p>
<p>172<br>00:15:23,600 –&gt; 00:15:28,279<br>and the source along the way. So there’s actually a protocol for doing this</p>
<p>173<br>00:15:28,279 –&gt; 00:15:33,399<br>for setting this up initially. And this is something that’s called RSVP or the</p>
<p>174<br>00:15:33,399 –&gt; 00:15:40,600<br>resource reservation protocol. And there is an ITF RFC that will tell us all</p>
<p>175<br>00:15:40,600 –&gt; 00:15:44,639<br>about what we’re supposed to do and it’s number 2205. You can find this in any</p>
<p>176<br>00:15:44,639 –&gt; 00:15:49,120<br>textbook. You can go and look at the RFC or if you look it up in Wikipedia you’ll</p>
<p>177<br>00:15:49,120 –&gt; 00:15:54,279<br>find a good description of this. So this is how we populate these values in the</p>
<p>178<br>00:15:54,279 –&gt; 00:15:59,840<br>first place. How it is that end to end the control system is able to install</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:59,840 –&gt; 00:16:05,519<br>these values along the path. So let’s look at a worked example of this now. So</p>
<p>180<br>00:16:05,519 –&gt; 00:16:12,279<br>imagine that in the network below we want an application to be able to send</p>
<p>181<br>00:16:12,279 –&gt; 00:16:17,919<br>at a rate of 10 megabits per second and have an end to end delay of less than</p>
<p>182<br>00:16:17,919 –&gt; 00:16:22,679<br>five milliseconds when it sends thousand byte packets. Let’s see how we would do</p>
<p>183<br>00:16:22,679 –&gt; 00:16:28,279<br>that. So first of all let’s calculate the fixed portion because there’s nothing we</p>
<p>184<br>00:16:28,279 –&gt; 00:16:31,679<br>can do about the fixed portion of the end to end delay that’s going to be made</p>
<p>185<br>00:16:31,679 –&gt; 00:16:36,719<br>up by the packetization delay and the propagation delay. So let’s look at the</p>
<p>186<br>00:16:36,719 –&gt; 00:16:44,599<br>packetization delay first. Packetization delay and to end is going to be well</p>
<p>187<br>00:16:44,600 –&gt; 00:16:49,279<br>it’s the sum of the packetization delay across all of the links. So on the</p>
<p>188<br>00:16:49,279 –&gt; 00:16:53,639<br>first link I’ve got thousand byte packets that I’m sending so they are a</p>
<p>189<br>00:16:53,639 –&gt; 00:16:59,360<br>thousand times eight bits divided by the rate that they’re going to go over the</p>
<p>190<br>00:16:59,360 –&gt; 00:17:05,559<br>first link which is a one gigabit per second. So that’s 10 to the power of nine.</p>
<p>191<br>00:17:06,059 –&gt; 00:17:15,639<br>And plus, oops, plus, I need the same thing for the thousand byte packets going</p>
<p>192<br>00:17:15,639 –&gt; 00:17:20,960<br>over the hundred megabit per second which is 10 to the eight and then I’m</p>
<p>193<br>00:17:20,960 –&gt; 00:17:24,359<br>going to have the same thing over here for this. So I’m just going to multiply this</p>
<p>194<br>00:17:24,359 –&gt; 00:17:32,399<br>by two because the last link is the same. And then I’ve got the propagation delay,</p>
<p>195<br>00:17:32,400 –&gt; 00:17:41,400<br>the propagation delay along all of these links which is going to be the</p>
<p>196<br>00:17:41,400 –&gt; 00:17:46,940<br>the length of the link which is 10 kilometers divided by the rate. So I’ve got</p>
<p>197<br>00:17:46,940 –&gt; 00:17:53,080<br>120 kilometers in total, 120 kilometers so that’s 10 times 10 to the three</p>
<p>198<br>00:17:53,080 –&gt; 00:17:57,759<br>meters divided by the propagation speed which I’m just going to assume is two</p>
<p>199<br>00:17:57,759 –&gt; 00:18:02,359<br>times 10 to the eight meters per second. And so if I add these two together I’ve</p>
<p>200<br>00:18:02,359 –&gt; 00:18:09,720<br>already done that and that comes out as 0.696, 696 milliseconds. So I’ve got a</p>
<p>201<br>00:18:09,720 –&gt; 00:18:15,039<br>fixed propagation delay of 0.696 milliseconds and so therefore I need the</p>
<p>202<br>00:18:15,039 –&gt; 00:18:20,519<br>sum of all the queuing delays along the path to be less than or equal to the</p>
<p>203<br>00:18:20,519 –&gt; 00:18:24,359<br>difference between that and five milliseconds. So that needs to be less than</p>
<p>204<br>00:18:24,359 –&gt; 00:18:32,240<br>4.304 milliseconds. Okay, so we’re going to remember this number because I’m going</p>
<p>205<br>00:18:32,240 –&gt; 00:18:38,199<br>to clear this and then we’re going to figure out how to make that work. So let’s</p>
<p>206<br>00:18:38,199 –&gt; 00:18:43,919<br>choose to split the delay that are the queuing delay equally amongst the two</p>
<p>207<br>00:18:43,919 –&gt; 00:18:48,000<br>routers. I can actually do this in any way I want. It’s going to make the math</p>
<p>208<br>00:18:48,000 –&gt; 00:18:52,679<br>easier if I split it equally. In other words it’s going to be just over two</p>
<p>209<br>00:18:52,680 –&gt; 00:18:58,840<br>milliseconds for each one. So let’s clear that. So I’m going to make it so that</p>
<p>210<br>00:18:58,840 –&gt; 00:19:08,360<br>the delay through here is less than or equal to 2.152 milliseconds and the</p>
<p>211<br>00:19:08,360 –&gt; 00:19:15,360<br>same thing here. Right, so I’ll just draw that. That’s the same value. Now I know</p>
<p>212<br>00:19:15,360 –&gt; 00:19:19,200<br>what the rate is of the flow. It’s 10 megabits per second. So I know the rate of</p>
<p>213<br>00:19:19,200 –&gt; 00:19:23,519<br>which the queue is going to be serviced. That’s going to be 10 megabits per</p>
<p>214<br>00:19:23,519 –&gt; 00:19:27,480<br>second. Now I’m trying to figure out how big B should be, how big should the</p>
<p>215<br>00:19:27,480 –&gt; 00:19:36,200<br>buffer be. So B, the size of the buffer, the buffer in each one, B needs to be</p>
<p>216<br>00:19:36,200 –&gt; 00:19:40,680<br>large enough that I never drop anything. And so it’s got to be greater than 10</p>
<p>217<br>00:19:40,680 –&gt; 00:19:44,400<br>megabits per second because that’s the rate at which it’s going to be served.</p>
<p>218<br>00:19:44,560 –&gt; 00:19:51,840<br>Times the duration of a bit through it. Well we already know that’s 2.152 milliseconds.</p>
<p>219<br>00:19:51,840 –&gt; 00:20:04,640<br>Okay, and so this ends up as 2,000, what is it? 21,520 bits, which is 2,690 bytes.</p>
<p>220<br>00:20:04,640 –&gt; 00:20:10,880<br>So I’ve got roughly three packets worth of delay that I must have. So basically</p>
<p>221<br>00:20:10,880 –&gt; 00:20:15,520<br>what this tells me is using weighted fair queuing, I will serve each of these</p>
<p>222<br>00:20:15,520 –&gt; 00:20:20,240<br>queues at a rate of 10 megabits per second. I now I need to do that in order for</p>
<p>223<br>00:20:20,240 –&gt; 00:20:24,000<br>the system to meet this 10 megabit per second requirement. And I will assign a</p>
<p>224<br>00:20:24,000 –&gt; 00:20:33,200<br>buffer at each of those routers to be at least 2.690 bytes at each of those along</p>
<p>225<br>00:20:33,200 –&gt; 00:20:38,520<br>the path. Then if I add up all of the delays, my overall end to end delay will be</p>
<p>226<br>00:20:38,519 –&gt; 00:20:43,400<br>less than or equal to 5 milliseconds, which is what I was trying to achieve.</p>
<p>227<br>00:21:09,079 –&gt; 00:21:27,160<br>So in practice, it’s as I’ve shown you, it’s technically possible to provide this end to end delay,</p>
<p>228<br>00:21:27,160 –&gt; 00:21:31,559<br>but actually very few networks actually control the end to end delay. In other words, this is not</p>
<p>229<br>00:21:31,559 –&gt; 00:21:37,160<br>really used very widely in practice. Why is that? Well, it turns out it’s quite complicated to make</p>
<p>230<br>00:21:37,160 –&gt; 00:21:45,640<br>it work. It requires coordination amongst all of the players, all of the network operators,</p>
<p>231<br>00:21:45,640 –&gt; 00:21:51,720<br>the end to end, the routers along the way. And in practice, this hasn’t really taken off,</p>
<p>232<br>00:21:51,720 –&gt; 00:21:56,279<br>and in most networks, the combination of over provisioning and priorities of traffic,</p>
<p>233<br>00:21:56,279 –&gt; 00:22:00,840<br>so giving high priority to those that need special treatment has proved to work well enough</p>
<p>234<br>00:22:00,840 –&gt; 00:22:05,640<br>in most cases. I wanted to go through and tell you this because if you can understand how this</p>
<p>235<br>00:22:05,640 –&gt; 00:22:10,200<br>whole weighted fair-curing mechanism works and how we can provide end to end delay guarantees,</p>
<p>236<br>00:22:10,200 –&gt; 00:22:15,240<br>you understand a lot about the queuing dynamics of a packet switch network. And also,</p>
<p>237<br>00:22:15,240 –&gt; 00:22:19,640<br>it’s quite likely that some of these ideas will be used in some networks in the future,</p>
<p>238<br>00:22:19,640 –&gt; 00:22:26,920<br>so they should prove useful to you. And so in summary, if we know the size of a queue and the rate</p>
<p>239<br>00:22:26,920 –&gt; 00:22:32,680<br>at which it’s being served, then we can delay the, we can bound the delay through it. We can pick</p>
<p>240<br>00:22:32,680 –&gt; 00:22:38,440<br>the size of the queue and using weighted fair queuing, we can pick the rate at which the queue is served.</p>
<p>241<br>00:22:38,440 –&gt; 00:22:44,279<br>Therefore, we just need a way to prevent packets from being dropped along the way. For this, we use a</p>
<p>242<br>00:22:44,279 –&gt; 00:22:51,879<br>leaky bucket regulator. And with that, we can therefore bound the end to end delay. That’s the end of the video.</p>
