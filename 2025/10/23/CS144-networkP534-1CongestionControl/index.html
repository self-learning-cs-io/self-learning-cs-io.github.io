<p>2<br>00:00:04,799 –&gt; 00:00:10,080<br>Congestion control is a really important topic for networking because whenever we</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,080 –&gt; 00:00:13,839<br>have a network, particularly a packet switched network like the internet, it will</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:13,839 –&gt; 00:00:17,400<br>always encounter congestion either for short periods or long periods.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:17,400 –&gt; 00:00:22,320<br>Controlling that congestion to stop the network from collapsing is really,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:22,320 –&gt; 00:00:28,560<br>really important and so we’re going to be learning about what congestion is and how</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,559 –&gt; 00:00:33,119<br>to control it, basic approaches to congestion control, and then we’re going to look</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:33,119 –&gt; 00:00:35,960<br>specifically at what happens in the internet.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:35,960 –&gt; 00:00:42,799<br>And congestion control happens inside the TCP protocol and TCP has explicit support</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:42,799 –&gt; 00:00:46,879<br>for congestion control and we’re going to be looking at how it does that and how</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,879 –&gt; 00:00:50,920<br>that’s evolved over time and then what some of the consequences are of those</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:50,920 –&gt; 00:00:55,519<br>decisions. Let’s start by thinking about what congestion is.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:55,760 –&gt; 00:00:59,920<br>Congestion can take place at multiple time scales. I’m going to offer you three</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:59,920 –&gt; 00:01:05,600<br>examples here and the first one is at a very short time scale when packets are</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:05,600 –&gt; 00:01:10,480<br>colliding at a router. So for example imagine that we’ve got two</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:10,480 –&gt; 00:01:14,960<br>packets, the first one arriving here in red and the second one arriving shortly</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:14,960 –&gt; 00:01:19,680<br>afterwards both test into the same output and because they’ve both arrived at</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:19,680 –&gt; 00:01:22,800<br>the same time one of them will get to leave, the other one will be queued and</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:22,799 –&gt; 00:01:26,799<br>there will be a temporary buildup of the queue in the router.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:26,799 –&gt; 00:01:31,120<br>A second form of congestion at a slightly longer time scale is at the flow</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:31,120 –&gt; 00:01:35,039<br>level operating at the time scale of round trip times or multiple round trip</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:35,039 –&gt; 00:01:40,640<br>times. If you think of a flow as a communication like a TCP flow where the</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:40,640 –&gt; 00:01:44,959<br>communication is taking place over a fairly long period over multiple round trip</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:44,959 –&gt; 00:01:49,840<br>times for example downloading a web page or sending an email then the rate of</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:49,840 –&gt; 00:01:54,799<br>the flow might change and I’ve shown one here in red and one here in green</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:54,799 –&gt; 00:02:00,000<br>and these may both be passing through the buffer of a router trying to get out</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:00,000 –&gt; 00:02:05,760<br>to the same outgoing link. If they combine rates exceed the outgoing</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:05,760 –&gt; 00:02:10,400<br>link rate as seems to be the case here then the buffer will build up and eventually</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:10,400 –&gt; 00:02:15,280<br>it will overflow and so we’ll need to do something to prevent those flows from</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:15,280 –&gt; 00:02:18,879<br>continuing to overwhelm that link otherwise we’re just going to drop a</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:18,879 –&gt; 00:02:23,599<br>whole load of packets and have a collapse in the</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:23,599 –&gt; 00:02:29,120<br>and the performance of the network. The third type is at a much longer time scale</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:29,120 –&gt; 00:02:33,280<br>which is there are a human time scale when there are just simply too many users</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:33,280 –&gt; 00:02:37,199<br>using a link during a peak hour. This might be a link connecting to a very</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:37,199 –&gt; 00:02:43,519<br>busy web server like cnn.com or google.com and in the morning people may come in</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:43,519 –&gt; 00:02:48,240<br>and all want to access the same link while they’re reading their coffee and</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:48,240 –&gt; 00:02:52,320<br>it might overwhelm it and so this would be at a longer time scale.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:52,320 –&gt; 00:02:55,600<br>The one that we’re going to be most interested in when we’re talking about</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:55,600 –&gt; 00:03:00,159<br>congestion control is this one in the middle. We’re going to look at how</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:00,159 –&gt; 00:03:04,879<br>congestion can be controlled for TCP flows in particular</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:04,879 –&gt; 00:03:08,560<br>that are lasting multiple round trip times where we have the opportunity</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:08,560 –&gt; 00:03:13,760<br>to communicate to the sender or send information back to the sender or for the</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:13,760 –&gt; 00:03:17,360<br>sender simply to learn that it should change the amount of data that it</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:17,360 –&gt; 00:03:21,360<br>puts into the network so as to prevent sustained congestion from happening</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:21,360 –&gt; 00:03:24,960<br>over the routers. Let’s take this a little bit further and think about</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:24,960 –&gt; 00:03:31,520<br>what congestion is by way of an example. So we look at the example here where</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:31,520 –&gt; 00:03:36,480<br>sources A and B are trained to send to the same destination</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:36,480 –&gt; 00:03:43,360<br>X and their flows are they’re both wanting to send at 12 megabits per second</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:43,360 –&gt; 00:03:49,600<br>at a sustained rate but the link from the router to X is only capable of sending</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:49,600 –&gt; 00:03:52,800<br>at 12 megabits per second. By the way there’s nothing magical about the</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:52,800 –&gt; 00:03:56,240<br>numbers 12 here other than it’s going to make the math a little bit easier.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:56,240 –&gt; 00:04:02,320<br>So A has a consented a sustained rate of 12, B consented a sustained rate of 12</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:02,320 –&gt; 00:04:07,600<br>and this link here which is the departure rate from the router buffer</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:07,600 –&gt; 00:04:13,280<br>and the just before the outgoing link is only able to send at rate 12.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:13,759 –&gt; 00:04:17,839<br>So if we look at one of our deterministic</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:17,839 –&gt; 00:04:23,920<br>queue models and just assume that this is at a sustained rate so this will be T</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:23,920 –&gt; 00:04:29,199<br>and this will be the cumulative data send so we’ll just think of this as the</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:29,199 –&gt; 00:04:37,840<br>cumulative bits sent on a link. We will have A1 of T</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:38,720 –&gt; 00:04:42,319<br>it will accumulate at 12 megabits per second so the gradient of this will be</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:42,319 –&gt; 00:04:47,759<br>12 megabits per second and so will A2 of T. I’m not going to try and draw that</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:47,759 –&gt; 00:04:56,639<br>superimpose that but so will D of T. So if we look at the sum of A1 plus A2</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:56,639 –&gt; 00:05:05,039<br>so this would be A1 plus A2 and of course this here let me draw this in a</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:05,039 –&gt; 00:05:12,000<br>different color this would be D of T. Then we can see that there will be a queue</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:12,000 –&gt; 00:05:18,639<br>that will build up queue of T and queue of T is just going to grow and grow and grow</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:19,439 –&gt; 00:05:25,040<br>just going to keep growing as because the the arrival rate is exceeding the departure rate.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:25,040 –&gt; 00:05:29,680<br>So hence eventually packets will be dropped and retransmitted. Notice that the</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:30,639 –&gt; 00:05:35,120<br>the transmissions are going to add to the traffic in the network because there’s going to be more</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:35,120 –&gt; 00:05:40,959<br>traffic sent down here because of these retransmissions and it’s going to make it even more congested.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:40,959 –&gt; 00:05:46,079<br>So congestion can actually have a feedback effect of making things worse by causing even more</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:46,079 –&gt; 00:05:55,359<br>traffic to be sent in into the network. Also it means that the the arrival rate here although</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:55,359 –&gt; 00:06:00,879<br>it will be a sustained arrival rate into the queue it must in some sense be truncated because</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:00,879 –&gt; 00:06:05,039<br>the departure rate obviously can’t exceed 12 megabits per second.</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:05,360 –&gt; 00:06:15,200<br>Now let’s assume for a moment that the buffers are infinite and think about what we would actually</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:15,200 –&gt; 00:06:23,200<br>like to have happen here. Let’s say that instead of A1 of T this is rate R1 that the first</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:23,200 –&gt; 00:06:30,800<br>that A would like to send in it and we’ll call this one R2 and we’ll say that the rate here is R</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:30,800 –&gt; 00:06:36,560<br>because then of course these could be any values in practice. It’s reasonable to expect that if R1</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:36,560 –&gt; 00:06:44,720<br>and R2 are both larger than R over 2 then we would give each one of them, we would actually assign</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:44,720 –&gt; 00:06:50,800<br>to each one of them the rate R over 2. So if they both want more than half of that outgoing link</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:50,800 –&gt; 00:06:57,840<br>then it would seem to make sense that they would both get R2, R over 2. So this example is very simple.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:58,799 –&gt; 00:07:04,799<br>In general congestion can happen at any point in the network with one flow, two flows or any</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:04,799 –&gt; 00:07:09,039<br>number of flows. Some of the flows might have that bottleneck at this particular congested router.</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:09,759 –&gt; 00:07:14,399<br>Others might not, they might have flows that are that they might be congested at a different</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:14,399 –&gt; 00:07:19,039<br>router somewhere else in the network. So let’s look at a slightly more complicated example.</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:19,439 –&gt; 00:07:31,120<br>Let’s first look at what’s going on. We’ve got our sources A and B again wanting to send at 12</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:31,120 –&gt; 00:07:37,520<br>megabits per second and we’ve got a third source now wanting to send at 12 megabits per second</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:37,520 –&gt; 00:07:43,600<br>and we’ve got a second router and all the links, both of the links here are 12 megabits per second</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:43,600 –&gt; 00:07:49,920<br>again. First notice that there are definitely going to be packets dropped if the flows from A, B</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:49,920 –&gt; 00:07:54,879<br>and C run at the sustained 12 megabits per second. Clearly there’s congestion in the network and they</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:54,879 –&gt; 00:08:00,800<br>can all going to contribute to that congestion. Second notice that any packets from A and B that make</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:00,800 –&gt; 00:08:08,080<br>it through the first router and are then dropped at the second router. So if they are then dropped</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:08,080 –&gt; 00:08:12,400<br>because of the congestion at the second link are going to be a waste of network traffic. In other</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:12,399 –&gt; 00:08:18,239<br>words they’ve used this precious congested resource here. If they then dropped here then there was</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:18,239 –&gt; 00:08:23,120<br>no not really any point in sending them. So it’s worthwhile thinking about how we get the information</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:23,120 –&gt; 00:08:28,079<br>back to the source so that it isn’t going to send unnecessary traffic through the network only to</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:28,079 –&gt; 00:08:36,799<br>be dropped at a downstream router. Third notice that it’s not obvious what the split of the last link</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:36,799 –&gt; 00:08:43,679<br>should be. If the router simply split the usage at each bottleneck, in other words we split it</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:43,679 –&gt; 00:08:51,759<br>50-50, then at this point here, over this link here we would see six megabits from A and six megabits</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:51,759 –&gt; 00:08:58,959<br>from per second from B. And then if we would have split here 50-50 then we would see six megabits per</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:58,959 –&gt; 00:09:05,599<br>second from C and we would see half of whatever came in through the second router. So we would see</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:05,600 –&gt; 00:09:12,080<br>three from A and three from B summing to 12. So I’m clear that that’s what we want. It might be</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:12,080 –&gt; 00:09:17,200<br>that we actually want each of them to get four. That might be a more reasonable thing so that they each</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:17,200 –&gt; 00:09:23,680<br>get equal access if that last router. So it’s going to be important to think about how we divide up the</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:23,680 –&gt; 00:09:31,040<br>capacity that’s available. Now let’s make it slightly more complicated. Imagine that we’ve got an extra</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:31,759 –&gt; 00:09:39,759<br>sender D that wants to send just at one megabits per second. So D wants to send less than at a rate which</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:39,759 –&gt; 00:09:45,519<br>is less than the others. So what rate should it be allowed to send at? We might say that everyone should</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:45,519 –&gt; 00:09:52,639<br>send at less than their requested rate because the link is congested. In other words because the link</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:52,639 –&gt; 00:09:58,719<br>over here is going to be congested because there’s 12, 24, 36, 37 megabits per second that wants to</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:58,720 –&gt; 00:10:05,200<br>flow over it. Everybody should run slower as a consequence. On the other hand, we might say that</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:05,200 –&gt; 00:10:10,320<br>because D is asking for less than its fair share of the link. So there’s one link here and four of them</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:10,320 –&gt; 00:10:14,480<br>because it’s asking for less than three megabits per second. Maybe we should give it its full one.</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:15,759 –&gt; 00:10:20,639<br>So we’re going to see some more examples of this in a definition of fairness in a little while.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:20,639 –&gt; 00:10:25,040<br>Something else to note is that congestion is unavoidable in a packet switch network. I mean,</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:25,039 –&gt; 00:10:30,639<br>arguably it’s actually a good thing. We use packet switching because it makes efficient use of</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:30,639 –&gt; 00:10:35,919<br>the links because of statistical multiplexing. Therefore the buffers in the routers are frequently</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:35,919 –&gt; 00:10:43,759<br>occupied and quite likely to overflow. In fact, if the buffers were always empty, then the links</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:43,759 –&gt; 00:10:49,759<br>would be quiet much of the time. So delay would be low but our usage of the network would be low</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:49,759 –&gt; 00:10:54,319<br>and so therefore would be using the network quite inefficiently. If buffers are always occupied,</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:54,320 –&gt; 00:10:58,000<br>while the delay is high, we’d be seeing the network used very efficiently because it would be</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:58,000 –&gt; 00:11:03,200<br>busy all of the time. So we’re going to see congestion is a really inevitable property of the</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:03,200 –&gt; 00:11:07,600<br>network and having a little bit of congestion is a good thing because it keeps the usage of the</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:07,600 –&gt; 00:11:13,840<br>network high. We just need to be able to control it to stop us making the delay so high, the drop so</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:13,840 –&gt; 00:11:19,520<br>high that the network becomes unusable. So some observations of what we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:19,519 –&gt; 00:11:24,720<br>Congestion is inevitable and arguably desirable. Congestion happens at different time scales from</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:24,720 –&gt; 00:11:29,679<br>packets colliding to some flow sending too quickly to flash crowds appearing in the network.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:30,720 –&gt; 00:11:36,000<br>If packets are dropped, then retransmissions can make congestion even worse. When packets are</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:36,000 –&gt; 00:11:41,039<br>dropped, they waste resources upstream before they were dropped, so that’s a bad thing. And we’re</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:41,039 –&gt; 00:11:46,480<br>going to need a definition of fairness to decide how we want flows to share a bottleneck link.</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:47,440 –&gt; 00:11:51,360<br>Next, we’re going to explore the kind of fairness that we would like in the network because this</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:51,360 –&gt; 00:11:57,920<br>is going to help us think about how to design a congestion control mechanism. So let’s consider an</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:57,920 –&gt; 00:12:06,879<br>example of when I have three routers in a network. Here are the three routers connected by links.</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:06,879 –&gt; 00:12:14,879<br>And the first link I’m going to assume is of rate two, the second one of rate one. And then I’m</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:14,879 –&gt; 00:12:24,000<br>going to have three sources, a, b, and c, all connected. And they’re going to be sending flows like this</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:24,000 –&gt; 00:12:30,159<br>through the network. First one goes, b’s goes through the second router and then stops,</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:30,720 –&gt; 00:12:36,080<br>c’s comes in at the second router and then goes out through the third. So the question is, what</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:36,080 –&gt; 00:12:42,720<br>would be a fair allocation of rates if they all want to send at maximum rate through the network?</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:42,720 –&gt; 00:12:46,800<br>Let’s think about the rates that we’re going to assign to each of these, each of these flows.</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:47,519 –&gt; 00:12:58,000<br>The first allocation is one in which I’m going to give a flow of 0.25, b, a flow, a rate of 1.75,</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:58,000 –&gt; 00:13:04,320<br>and c, a rate of 0.75. So you know, I’ve not exceeded the rate on any one of them. There’s a total</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:04,320 –&gt; 00:13:15,440<br>of one here and a total of two here. And the total throughput here is 1.75 plus 0.7 is 2.5 is 2.75.</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:17,840 –&gt; 00:13:25,600<br>Now let me consider a different rate allocation. And I’ll call that one two. And in this rate allocation,</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:25,600 –&gt; 00:13:41,519<br>I give a 0.5, I give c 0.5, and I’m going to give b 1.5. This has a total of 1.5 plus 0.5 is 2, 2.5.</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:41,519 –&gt; 00:13:45,759<br>So it’s actually lower overall throughput. But if you look at this link here, which is kind of the</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:45,759 –&gt; 00:13:51,680<br>bottleneck link of the network, I’ve given the same to c as I have to a. And so we might say that this</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:51,679 –&gt; 00:13:57,439<br>one is more fair. So there’s a trade off here between fairness, one in which we’re giving equal</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:57,439 –&gt; 00:14:03,919<br>usage of the bottleneck links versus the throughput where we’re trying to maximize the overall throughput.</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:03,919 –&gt; 00:14:10,319<br>And essentially we can see here that a is being penalized in the second in the first one, where</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:10,319 –&gt; 00:14:15,679<br>at the first allocation where it only has a rate of 0.25, because it’s going through multiple links</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:15,679 –&gt; 00:14:20,319<br>in the in the network. We can therefore see that fairness and throughput can be a dogs with each</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:20,320 –&gt; 00:14:25,120<br>other. So before we start designing or comparing ways to control congestion, we could we could do with</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:25,120 –&gt; 00:14:30,560<br>the definition of the kind of fairness that we would like to achieve. So the definition that we’re</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:30,560 –&gt; 00:14:37,440<br>going to use is is called max min fairness or maximizing the minimum. And it’s a widely used</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:37,440 –&gt; 00:14:41,760<br>definition of fairness. Well, it’s not the only definition we could use. It makes sense because it</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:41,760 –&gt; 00:14:47,120<br>tries to maximize the rate of the little flows while making sure that every flow that would like it</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:47,120 –&gt; 00:14:52,000<br>can have an equal share of its bottleneck link. So the formal definition is shown here.</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:52,000 –&gt; 00:14:58,960<br>And allocation is maximum in fair. If you cannot increase the rate of one flow without decreasing the</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:58,960 –&gt; 00:15:06,240<br>rate of another flow with a lower rate. Let’s look at what that would mean in my example before. Actually</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:06,240 –&gt; 00:15:14,080<br>the second allocation that I showed you was in fact, maximum fair, fair. Because if we increase the</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:14,080 –&gt; 00:15:22,560<br>rate of B. So if we were to try and increase this one here, beyond 1.5, we would have to decrease</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:22,560 –&gt; 00:15:33,360<br>R of A the rate of A. And so this is a we can only increase whenever we increase one we will decrease</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:33,360 –&gt; 00:15:40,720<br>one that is lower. And therefore this is the maximum in allocare allocation. What it essentially</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:40,800 –&gt; 00:15:49,120<br>means is that links that share a bottleneck. So for example here, we’ll have an equal share if they</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:49,120 –&gt; 00:15:55,120<br>want to use all of that link or more than their fair share, they will be curtailed to their fair share.</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:55,120 –&gt; 00:15:59,440<br>So they’re each getting half of that. Let me show you an example on a single link, which will be</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:59,440 –&gt; 00:16:06,399<br>easier to understand. So they’re a very simple and intuitive definition on a single link. So if we have</p>
<p>165<br>00:16:06,399 –&gt; 00:16:19,039<br>a router, let me draw a router here. And I have A and B that want to connect to that router at</p>
<p>166<br>00:16:20,559 –&gt; 00:16:30,079<br>0.5 megabits per second, not just a 0.5 and 1. And then it has a link of rate 1 coming out of it.</p>
<p>167<br>00:16:30,320 –&gt; 00:16:38,160<br>And then let’s consider that as a third one, C, that wants to connect to it at 0.2. So the combined</p>
<p>168<br>00:16:39,040 –&gt; 00:16:44,400<br>rate that we would like to send through here from A, B and C is 1.7, but we’ve only got a rate of</p>
<p>169<br>00:16:44,400 –&gt; 00:16:50,080</p>
<ol>
<li>So what would be the fair share? Well, C is the minimum. So we’re going to start by allocating the</li>
</ol>
<p>170<br>00:16:50,080 –&gt; 00:16:55,920<br>minimum and C, once less than its fair share. In other words, the fair share would be a third each,</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:55,919 –&gt; 00:17:03,360<br>at 1.2, which is less than a third. So we’re going to allocate to it 0.2. That’s going to leave 0.8</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:03,360 –&gt; 00:17:11,279<br>on this link. And the fair share of the other two would now be 0.4, half of 0.8 each. A wants more</p>
<p>173<br>00:17:11,279 –&gt; 00:17:21,759<br>than that. So it’s going to be curtailed to 0.4 and B also wants more than the 0.4. So it’s going to</p>
<p>174<br>00:17:21,759 –&gt; 00:17:29,680<br>get 0.4 as well. So the total is going to sum to 1. If we increase the rate of any of them,</p>
<p>175<br>00:17:30,319 –&gt; 00:17:36,079<br>then it would be at the expense of a slower flow. And so this is the maximum fair allocation.</p>
<p>176<br>00:17:38,240 –&gt; 00:17:42,559<br>Now that you understand what congestion is, in the next few videos I’m going to look at different</p>
<p>177<br>00:17:42,559 –&gt; 00:17:47,519<br>ways to design congestion control algorithms. So we’re going to start from, start looking at some</p>
<p>178<br>00:17:47,519 –&gt; 00:17:51,920<br>different techniques and end up with how TCP works. And look at that in some detail, and they’ll look</p>
<p>179<br>00:17:51,920 –&gt; 00:17:57,119<br>at some of the consequences of those designs. So with, while having some goals, so that we can bear them</p>
<p>180<br>00:17:57,119 –&gt; 00:18:01,759<br>in mind when we’re designing the algorithms and when we’re comparing one against another. So I’ve</p>
<p>181<br>00:18:01,759 –&gt; 00:18:06,720<br>got a list here, some of which we’ve seen and some of which we’ll be new, but pretty obvious in why</p>
<p>182<br>00:18:06,720 –&gt; 00:18:11,759<br>we’re considering the first one is we want high throughput. We want to keep links busy,</p>
<p>183<br>00:18:12,480 –&gt; 00:18:17,119<br>because we want to make efficient use of the network. And we want flows to be fast and to</p>
<p>184<br>00:18:17,119 –&gt; 00:18:23,039<br>complete quickly. Second one is that we would like it to be fair, and we’re going to typically use</p>
<p>185<br>00:18:23,039 –&gt; 00:18:27,439<br>our maximum fairness goal, because it gives a nice balance between pretty good throughput through</p>
<p>186<br>00:18:27,439 –&gt; 00:18:31,919<br>the network, but also making sure that all the flows that are contending for a bottleneck link</p>
<p>187<br>00:18:31,919 –&gt; 00:18:37,519<br>get treated fairly, and the little ones get a good access to that link. We would like the</p>
<p>188<br>00:18:37,519 –&gt; 00:18:42,319<br>congestion control mechanism to respond quickly to changing network conditions. If other flows</p>
<p>189<br>00:18:42,319 –&gt; 00:18:47,919<br>arrive and the congestion increases, we need to be able to back off a little bit so that we don’t</p>
<p>190<br>00:18:47,919 –&gt; 00:18:52,960<br>cause too much congestion in the network. And if other flows go away and finish and more capacity</p>
<p>191<br>00:18:52,960 –&gt; 00:18:58,720<br>becomes available, we’d like to be able to use that quickly so that we can make efficient usage</p>
<p>192<br>00:18:58,720 –&gt; 00:19:03,839<br>of the network. And finally, we want the control to be distributed. We can’t rely on there being</p>
<p>193<br>00:19:03,839 –&gt; 00:19:08,240<br>some central arbiter that is going to decide the rates for the entire network. We need this to</p>
<p>194<br>00:19:08,240 –&gt; 00:19:12,480<br>operate in a distributed fashion in order for it to be scalable. And these are the sorts of things</p>
<p>195<br>00:19:12,480 –&gt; 00:19:16,480<br>we’re going to consider over the next few videos.</p>
