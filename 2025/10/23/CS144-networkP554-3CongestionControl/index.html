                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,320<br>In the last video, I told you how we can use the additive increase multiplicative decrease method to</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,320 –&gt; 00:00:12,439<br>modulate the size of the TCP sliding window and therefore control the number of bytes that are</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:12,439 –&gt; 00:00:19,120<br>outstanding in the network. If we want to increase the number of bytes that are outstanding,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,120 –&gt; 00:00:23,480<br>we might contribute to more congestion. If there is congestion and we want to reduce it,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,480 –&gt; 00:00:28,240<br>then we might reduce the number of outstanding bytes, in other words reduce the window size.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,719 –&gt; 00:00:34,719<br>So using this window size modulation, we can vary the number of outstanding bytes and therefore</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:34,719 –&gt; 00:00:39,920<br>affect or control the amount of congestion in the network. Notice this has been done by</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:39,920 –&gt; 00:00:46,719<br>the end host only without any explicit support from the network. In order to understand how</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,719 –&gt; 00:00:52,719<br>AIMD works and then later how TCP congestion control works, we’re going to start by looking in</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:52,719 –&gt; 00:00:58,960<br>some detail at how AIMD works with a single flow. If we can understand how it works with a single</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:58,960 –&gt; 00:01:03,439<br>flow, then we have a chance of understanding how it works in a more complicated network with many,</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:03,439 –&gt; 00:01:12,879<br>many flows through a router at the same time. So we saw before AIMD works as follows. Each time a</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:12,879 –&gt; 00:01:18,799<br>packet is received okay, we increase the window by 1 over W. Therefore, once we’ve received the</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:18,799 –&gt; 00:01:25,200<br>whole windows worth of packets, the window size will be increased by 1. Every time a packet is dropped,</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:26,079 –&gt; 00:01:32,319<br>we’re going to decrease the window size multiplicatively. We’re going to reduce it by a factor of 2,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:32,879 –&gt; 00:01:41,840<br>and this is the dynamics that we saw before. Now let’s look at an animation of the AIMD process working</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:41,840 –&gt; 00:01:50,640<br>in practice. We’re going to take a good look at this animation of a single AIMD flow over a single</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:50,640 –&gt; 00:01:58,480<br>bottleneck link. If we look on the let me explain what’s going on with the figure, the congestion</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:58,480 –&gt; 00:02:05,920<br>window size W is shown on the graph down here varying as a function of time. So this is a C-wind,</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:06,480 –&gt; 00:02:12,640<br>the congestion window, and this is the same as the value here at the source. So this is the source,</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:13,280 –&gt; 00:02:19,920<br>this is the destination, and this is the router in between. The router has a buffer, and it’s going to</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:19,920 –&gt; 00:02:26,479<br>buffer packets that are waiting to go onto the egress link. The egress link is this one here, and this is</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:26,479 –&gt; 00:02:33,120<br>the bottleneck link between the source and the destination. This link here on the left is running</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:33,120 –&gt; 00:02:38,159<br>faster than the link on the right, which is why every now and again there’s a build up of packets</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:38,159 –&gt; 00:02:43,599<br>in this buffer because they’re arriving faster than they are departing. The reason that the packets</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:43,599 –&gt; 00:02:47,840<br>look little or on the left than they do on the right is just supposed to represent the fact that the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:47,840 –&gt; 00:02:52,800<br>link on the left is running faster than the one on the right. In other words, I have a higher data</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:52,800 –&gt; 00:02:59,599<br>rate, and so the packetization delay is shorter, and so the packets appear a little bit shorter on</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:59,599 –&gt; 00:03:04,400<br>the left. So packets are going to flow from the source to the destination. They’re the blue ones,</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:05,039 –&gt; 00:03:10,639<br>and then for each packet there is an acknowledgement coming back to the source. That’s what the red ones</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:10,639 –&gt; 00:03:18,400<br>are at the top, and you can see that the arrival of the acknowledgments is clocking the transmission</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:18,400 –&gt; 00:03:24,159<br>of the next packet. So we often say that an algorithm like this is self-clocking, and we’ll see later</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:24,240 –&gt; 00:03:30,319<br>the TCP is self-clocking. The packets are triggered by an acknowledgement coming back.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:31,439 –&gt; 00:03:35,120<br>Okay, now that I’ve explained this, I’m going to restart it so that we can look at some of the</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:35,120 –&gt; 00:03:41,039<br>some of the dynamics. I’m actually going to give you our URL to this same animation, so you can play</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:41,039 –&gt; 00:03:51,120<br>around with this on your own time. So starting again, we can see that the</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:54,159 –&gt; 00:03:59,120<br>window size here is telling us how many packets there can be outstanding in the network.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:59,120 –&gt; 00:04:05,199<br>And I like to think of it as there’s a kind of a bag that is representing the network as a whole,</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:05,199 –&gt; 00:04:10,000<br>and we’re trying to figure out how big that bag is. How many packets can we put into that bag</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:10,000 –&gt; 00:04:14,560<br>before they overflow and drop on the drop on the floor? And I find this a useful way to think about</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:14,560 –&gt; 00:04:21,920<br>AIMD. So we’re basically trying to figure out where those packets can be, and how many there can be</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:21,920 –&gt; 00:04:26,800<br>in the in the link. And really, there’s only a couple of two or three different places that they</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:26,800 –&gt; 00:04:34,000<br>can be. First of all, the packets can be on this link here, on this fixed capacity pipe. There are</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:34,000 –&gt; 00:04:38,800<br>a certain number of packets that we could fit under that under that into that pipe. There are a certain</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:38,800 –&gt; 00:04:43,280<br>number that we could put here, and there are a certain number that are represented by the</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:43,280 –&gt; 00:04:47,920<br>acknowledgments coming in the opposite direction. So all of those are fixed. The only variable</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:47,920 –&gt; 00:04:54,400<br>portion is how many that we have currently got in the buffer in the middle. So it’s like a</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:54,400 –&gt; 00:05:00,080<br>concertina. There’s this concertina that to start with, that concertina is closed, and we’re putting</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:00,080 –&gt; 00:05:06,000<br>the packets into the network. And then as we as we fill up the links, after the links are full,</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:06,000 –&gt; 00:05:11,840<br>the only place they can go is into the buffer. And the buffer will absorb for every extra</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:11,839 –&gt; 00:05:17,519<br>window, every extra time that we open the window, we are essentially putting an extra packet into</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:17,519 –&gt; 00:05:23,039<br>that packet buffer. So initially, when the window is at its minimum value, all the links are full,</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:23,039 –&gt; 00:05:29,439<br>but the buffer is empty. If we increase the window by size one, the links are full, so it can’t be</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:29,439 –&gt; 00:05:35,120<br>placed into the into the link. The only place that it can be placed is into the buffer. So the buffer</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:35,120 –&gt; 00:05:40,639<br>will increase by one. If we then increase the window by one again, it’ll go into the buffer,</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:40,639 –&gt; 00:05:44,879<br>increase it by one again, it’ll go into the buffer. Eventually the buffer overflows,</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:45,919 –&gt; 00:05:53,199<br>we drop a packet, and then the AIMD rules are that we drop the outstanding window size by half,</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:53,759 –&gt; 00:05:59,839<br>eventually the buffer will go empty again, and then we start again. So really, all we’re doing by</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:59,839 –&gt; 00:06:05,839<br>changing the window size is modulating the occupancy of the buffer at the bottleneck. If we look here</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:05,839 –&gt; 00:06:12,239<br>on the simulation, we can see that, we can see that happening. So right now the window size is</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:12,239 –&gt; 00:06:17,359<br>nine, so that we will see at any instant, there are nine packets and acknowledgments outstanding</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:17,359 –&gt; 00:06:23,759<br>in the network. But because the links are full, this outgoing link here is full, our bottleneck link is full,</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:24,639 –&gt; 00:06:31,199<br>the only place that those packets can go once we increase the window size is here. So we filled it up,</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:31,199 –&gt; 00:06:36,719<br>any additional ones are inside the buffer. And every now and again you’ll see that we’ve received a</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:36,719 –&gt; 00:06:42,959<br>full window’s worth, and then we increase the, there we go, we will increase the window size by one,</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:42,959 –&gt; 00:06:48,560<br>it’s currently at 13, in a moment it’ll increase to 14, and every time we increase the window size,</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:48,560 –&gt; 00:06:55,519<br>the buffer will have one more packet in it. And down here you can see that every time we</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:56,479 –&gt; 00:07:02,560<br>receive a full window’s worth, it will actually go up by one, and therefore that’s how the window</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:02,560 –&gt; 00:07:08,319<br>is going to evolve over time. So we’re almost getting to the point where the buffer is full,</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:08,959 –&gt; 00:07:15,839<br>we’ve got to a point where the the window is 16, and at the moment the rate at which packets are</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:15,839 –&gt; 00:07:21,519<br>coming in is exactly matching the rate at which they’re going out. In a moment, we’re going to</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:21,519 –&gt; 00:07:26,479<br>actually put one extra packet into the network and you see it got dropped, and the knowledge of that</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:26,479 –&gt; 00:07:32,000<br>drop is propagating through the network, it will now go on to the outgoing link, it will come back</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:32,000 –&gt; 00:07:36,319<br>actually through the absence of it acknowledgement, but that doesn’t matter. And so therefore the window</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:36,319 –&gt; 00:07:42,639<br>size will be halved, that’s what’s going on over here. The buffer will have will drain because we’re</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:42,639 –&gt; 00:07:48,240<br>only allowed to have half as many outstanding packets in the network, therefore we stop sending the,</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:48,720 –&gt; 00:07:54,960<br>the buffer drained because it drains at the full rate, and then we start the whole process off again.</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:56,800 –&gt; 00:08:02,639<br>The first thing I want you to notice is that the outgoing link is kept busy all the time, 100%</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:02,639 –&gt; 00:08:08,560<br>of the time, even though this window process is concertinaing, it’s going full up and then</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:08,560 –&gt; 00:08:13,280<br>full down when we have a drop, full up and then full down. So even though this window is going through</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:13,359 –&gt; 00:08:19,359<br>this sawtooth motion, the egress that bottleneck link in the network is staying busy all the time.</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:20,399 –&gt; 00:08:25,839<br>In other words, the rate at which packets are being sent is staying constant, and this is a really</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:25,839 –&gt; 00:08:32,159<br>important property of AIMD, particularly with a single link. It’s not really adjusting the rate,</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:32,159 –&gt; 00:08:37,679<br>it’s actually affecting the number of packets that can be outstanding in the network. And this subtle</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:37,679 –&gt; 00:08:42,079<br>distinction will become very important in a moment when I tell you a little bit more about the dynamics</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:42,560 –&gt; 00:08:48,560<br>of AIMD. And then it’ll help us understand what’s going on when there are multiple flows in the network.</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:56,400 –&gt; 00:09:01,280<br>To increase our understanding of what’s going on, let’s look at the dynamics of that single flow.</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:01,280 –&gt; 00:09:07,840<br>This is from a simulation in a well-known network simulator called NS of a single TCP flow</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:07,840 –&gt; 00:09:14,000<br>over a bottleneck link. The graph at the top here is telling us the evolution of the congestion</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:14,000 –&gt; 00:09:19,759<br>window or C-wind like we had before. That’s the red one. The green one is the RTT, the round trip time.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:21,040 –&gt; 00:09:26,160<br>This red line here is the utilization of the bottleneck link. In other words, how busy is that bottleneck</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:26,160 –&gt; 00:09:31,600<br>link kept? And down here is the occupancy of the buffer, and we can see that evolving. So it’s very</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:31,600 –&gt; 00:09:39,040<br>similar to the simulation that we just saw, the animation that we just saw. So notice that the</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:40,399 –&gt; 00:09:48,000<br>congestion window is moving in this beautiful sawtooth. But because every time we put one more packet</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:48,000 –&gt; 00:09:54,800<br>into the network, we increase the occupancy of the buffer. So every time we increase W, the only</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:54,800 –&gt; 00:09:59,759<br>place that that extra packet can go is in the buffer. So it’s going to move in perfect lock step with</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:00,319 –&gt; 00:10:06,000<br>with C-wind. But because we’re increasing the occupancy of the buffer, we’re increasing the delay</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:06,000 –&gt; 00:10:12,159<br>that packets experience as they go through the network. So therefore, the RTT, the round trip time,</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:12,159 –&gt; 00:10:22,080<br>is also going and following the same, exactly the same shape. So C-wind and the RTT actually follow</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:22,080 –&gt; 00:10:31,280<br>the same shape. The consequence of this is that the sending rate for a single flow,</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:32,160 –&gt; 00:10:41,040<br>which we can define to be the number of bytes that we send in one window divided by the round</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:41,040 –&gt; 00:10:48,960<br>trip time. Because the round trip time is varying with the window size, W over RTT is actually a</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:48,960 –&gt; 00:10:55,519<br>going to be a constant. This is actually going to be a constant. Why is that? The reason that</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:55,519 –&gt; 00:11:00,879<br>it’s constant is because W and RTT are moving in lock step, they’re essentially the same.</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:02,080 –&gt; 00:11:08,240<br>And we saw that in the animation. The Egress link was kept busy at all times. So we’re not really</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:08,240 –&gt; 00:11:12,480<br>modulating the rate. In fact, we don’t want to modulate the rate when everything is constant and</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:12,480 –&gt; 00:11:17,600<br>when you’ve got a single flow. We want to keep the outgoing link busy. All that the window is</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:17,600 –&gt; 00:11:23,360<br>doing is probing to see how big the bag is, how many more bytes we can put into the network without</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:23,360 –&gt; 00:11:29,680<br>it overflowing. And it’s constantly probing and changing that window size just in case the conditions</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:29,680 –&gt; 00:11:35,120<br>change and the capacity increases and therefore there’s more room in the bag to put more packets.</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:37,680 –&gt; 00:11:45,600<br>Just to just to belabor the point a little, the window size is going to move like this. RTT will</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:45,600 –&gt; 00:11:52,639<br>move like this in lock step and so this rate is a constant. So from this we can also make another</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:52,639 –&gt; 00:11:59,600<br>observation and that is how big should the buffer be so that the whole system will behave correctly.</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:59,600 –&gt; 00:12:05,120<br>So we saw last time that the buffer occupancy was moving in lock step with a window size process.</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:05,120 –&gt; 00:12:10,000<br>This picture down here is essentially the same as our animation. Our bottleneck link over here.</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:10,320 –&gt; 00:12:18,080<br>Our link here with a faster rate the router buffer between a and b. So if we were to look at that again</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:18,080 –&gt; 00:12:25,600<br>in our simulation and look at the behavior, the graph on the left are the same as the ones we saw</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:25,600 –&gt; 00:12:33,120<br>before and in this case the buffer occupancy equals RTT times c. In other words it’s just enough</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:33,120 –&gt; 00:12:40,720<br>to hold the enough packets that will fit into the round trip when the buffer is empty.</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:42,720 –&gt; 00:12:47,120<br>If we were to make the buffer a little bit smaller and that’s what we’re doing here so the buffer</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:47,120 –&gt; 00:12:55,600<br>is smaller then what happens is that the buffer after it’s, well after there’s been a drop which</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:55,600 –&gt; 00:13:03,519<br>is taking place here when the window size decreases and is halved according to the AMD rules</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:04,399 –&gt; 00:13:12,399<br>the buffer will fall because we have fewer outstanding bytes in the network. Therefore the source will</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:12,399 –&gt; 00:13:19,440<br>stop sending packets the buffer will drain but it’s draining an empty for some period. So if the</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:19,440 –&gt; 00:13:24,879<br>router buffer is empty it means the egress link our bottleneck link our precious resource is actually</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:24,879 –&gt; 00:13:32,399<br>not being used and so the utilization will drop from 100% during that time. So if we want to prevent</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:32,399 –&gt; 00:13:37,439<br>this from happening and have 100% at all times we need to make sure that this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>128<br>00:13:38,000 –&gt; 00:13:42,000<br>Therefore we need to make sure that the buffer never goes empty and we need a behavior like this</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:42,559 –&gt; 00:13:49,840<br>from which we need a buffer of RTT times c. Now why it’s specifically RTT times c you’ll see in a</p>
<p>130<br>00:13:49,840 –&gt; 00:13:56,160<br>problem set a little bit later but the basic intuition is that the buffer occupancy the size of the</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:56,160 –&gt; 00:14:02,560<br>buffer must from the peak to the trough must be the same as the distance from the peak to the trough</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:02,560 –&gt; 00:14:08,639<br>here to be able to ride out the time when the window size is halved and we have fewer outstanding</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:08,639 –&gt; 00:14:15,040<br>packets placed into the network and that distance there turns out to be RTT times c and we’ll see that</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:15,120 –&gt; 00:14:22,879<br>later in a problem set. Let’s summarize what we’ve learnt for a single flow. The window is going to</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:22,879 –&gt; 00:14:29,039<br>expand and contract according to AIMD the additive increase multiplicative decrease which is going to</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:29,039 –&gt; 00:14:35,599<br>modulate the size of the TCP sliding window in order to determine how many outstanding bytes they</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:35,599 –&gt; 00:14:41,599<br>can be in the network. Essentially we’re probing how many bytes that the pipe can hold from end to</p>
<p>138<br>00:14:42,000 –&gt; 00:14:46,000<br>end and we’re constantly going to be probing by changing the size of that window we’re going to</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:46,000 –&gt; 00:14:51,440<br>carefully increase it see how much space there is if we find that we overfill it we’re going to drop</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:51,440 –&gt; 00:14:55,680<br>back down again and then we’re going to keep trying to probe it to see if there’s more capacity</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:55,680 –&gt; 00:15:01,279<br>that’s available. So we’re going to tentatively additively increase and then if we find that we’re</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:01,279 –&gt; 00:15:07,040<br>going to trouble we’re going to very quickly in a very responsive way drop back down again to be able</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:07,039 –&gt; 00:15:12,719<br>to reduce the number of outstanding bytes in the network as quickly as we can. So the soar tooth</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:12,719 –&gt; 00:15:19,120<br>is actually the stable operating point of TCP there’s nothing out of control just because it’s</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:19,120 –&gt; 00:15:25,759<br>oscillating it’s exactly the behavior that we want under a stable operating condition and the</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:25,759 –&gt; 00:15:31,360<br>sending rate is in fact constant so long as we have enough buffers in the network which is RTT</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:32,320 –&gt; 00:15:37,600<br>so these are all the observations for a single flow. In the next video we’re going to see how things</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:37,600 –&gt; 00:15:47,279<br>are a little bit different when we have many flows in the network.</p>
