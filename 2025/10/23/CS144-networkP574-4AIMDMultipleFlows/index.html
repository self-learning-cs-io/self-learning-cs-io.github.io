                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,000<br>In the last video I explained how the AIMD algorithm controls congestion in the special case</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,000 –&gt; 00:00:13,439<br>where we have only one flow in the network. AIMD, which as you recall is short for additive</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,439 –&gt; 00:00:18,839<br>increase with multiplicative decrease, controls congestion by controlling the window size,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,839 –&gt; 00:00:23,839<br>and therefore it controls the number of outstanding packets in the network.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,839 –&gt; 00:00:28,440<br>Outstanding packets are also called unacknowledged packets because they are the packets that we’ve</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,440 –&gt; 00:00:33,600<br>sent but for which we’ve not yet received an acknowledgement to tell us that they arrive</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:33,600 –&gt; 00:00:40,840<br>safely at their destination. While it’s common to hear people say that AIMD controls the</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:40,840 –&gt; 00:00:47,439<br>rate at which packets are sent, it’s not strictly true. You’ll hear this mistake made a lot.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:47,439 –&gt; 00:00:53,280<br>All AIMD does is to control the number of outstanding packets in the network and that’s</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:53,280 –&gt; 00:00:59,640<br>really important to remember. When the network is empty and un-conjusted, it has room for</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:59,640 –&gt; 00:01:07,640<br>a flow to send more packets to have more outstanding unacknowledged packets in the network. But when</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:07,640 –&gt; 00:01:14,480<br>the network is full of packets and it’s congested, we have to reduce the number of packets that</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:14,480 –&gt; 00:01:19,200<br>our flows have outstanding so that we don’t overfill the buffers because that’s where they’re</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:19,200 –&gt; 00:01:25,120<br>being held and if we overfill them then of course we’re going to drop packets. It’s in this way</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:25,120 –&gt; 00:01:32,159<br>that AIMD there is the window size in order to find out how much room there is to place additional</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:32,159 –&gt; 00:01:39,079<br>packets or bytes in the network. So it’s constantly proving to figure out how big it can make the</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:39,079 –&gt; 00:01:45,600<br>window size because that’s the only thing it has to control. The single flow case helped us</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:45,599 –&gt; 00:01:51,399<br>understand the basics of AIMD. It particularly helps us understand networks in which there’s one</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:51,399 –&gt; 00:01:56,239<br>dominant flow in the network at the time. For example, in your home network when you’re streaming</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:56,239 –&gt; 00:02:05,159<br>video. But out in the crazy wilds of the internet, it’s very common for a router to have thousands</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:05,159 –&gt; 00:02:11,759<br>or even a million flows passing through it at the same time. The situation is very far removed</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:11,919 –&gt; 00:02:17,039<br>from that simple case with a single dominant flow and you’d expect that the dynamics of AIMD</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:17,039 –&gt; 00:02:22,239<br>would be very different when there are so many flows present and you’d be right. The dynamics</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:22,239 –&gt; 00:02:26,719<br>are very very different when a network carries many flows at the same time and so in this video</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:26,719 –&gt; 00:02:31,599<br>I’m going to explain how AIMD works in this case in a network with multiple flows.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:33,599 –&gt; 00:02:39,599<br>First let’s recap how we calculate the throughput of a flow. Imagine that server A has packets</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:39,599 –&gt; 00:02:43,919<br>to send a server B. Right now the window size is three packets which server A sends.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:45,439 –&gt; 00:02:50,319<br>B replies with three acknowledgments which arrive after one round trip time or RTT.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:51,199 –&gt; 00:02:55,199<br>Server A can now increase the window size by one packet and sends four packets.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:56,079 –&gt; 00:03:01,199<br>After another RTT, it can send five packets and so on until the window size grows to fill all the</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:01,199 –&gt; 00:03:07,359<br>buffers and a packet has to be dropped. You can see that in any cycle the throughput equals the</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:07,360 –&gt; 00:03:16,400<br>window size divided by the RTT. Let’s take a look at the packet buffer inside a router that is a</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:16,400 –&gt; 00:03:22,640<br>bottleneck for lots of flows. At any one time the router buffer has lots of packets in it from lots</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:22,640 –&gt; 00:03:28,720<br>and lots of different flows. It’s not uncommon for a router buffer to be able to hold hundreds of</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:28,720 –&gt; 00:03:34,160<br>thousands of packets and they will come from many many different flows. It’s just a log jam through</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:34,240 –&gt; 00:03:39,199<br>this buffer. In the picture I’ve used different colors to represent packets from different flows.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:39,199 –&gt; 00:03:43,759<br>I don’t have enough colors in PowerPoint to show all the different flows but you can see</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:43,759 –&gt; 00:03:49,439<br>immediately that the packets belonging to any one individual flow only make up a tiny fraction</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:49,439 –&gt; 00:03:55,519<br>of all the packets in the buffer. You can imagine that if 10,000 flows are sharing a buffer with</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:55,519 –&gt; 00:04:01,680<br>with room for 10,000 packets each flow will typically have just one packet in the buffer at a time.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:01,680 –&gt; 00:04:08,719<br>Occasionally a packet will arrive and find the buffer full. The packet is dropped and its flow will</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:08,719 –&gt; 00:04:14,240<br>halve its window size. With so many flows in the system you can see that the flows will experience</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:14,240 –&gt; 00:04:20,399<br>packet drops pretty much at random. It just depends on when a flows packet happens to arrive and</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:20,399 –&gt; 00:04:25,120<br>find the buffer full. Most of the time the buffer won’t be full but just occasionally a flow gets</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:25,120 –&gt; 00:04:29,519<br>unlucky and its packet arrives when the buffer is full and the flows packet is dropped.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:29,919 –&gt; 00:04:35,759<br>Remember that each flow follows its own independent AIMDs sort-tooth process.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:36,799 –&gt; 00:04:42,399<br>When a flow has one of its packets dropped the flow will halve its window size but all the other</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:42,399 –&gt; 00:04:47,839<br>flows will be unaffected. They’ll keep merrily increasing their window size until they get a drop</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:47,839 –&gt; 00:04:53,680<br>too. The more flows there are the smoother the occupancy of the queue will be with each flow</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:53,680 –&gt; 00:05:01,120<br>experience occasional random drops. If we zoom in on any one individual flow as I’ve done here</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:01,120 –&gt; 00:05:07,439<br>in red then you can see that it will still follow the AIMDs sort-tooth but the drops will happen</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:07,439 –&gt; 00:05:13,040<br>at random times because it really depends on when the flow happens to encounter a packet drop</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:13,040 –&gt; 00:05:20,240<br>and halves its window size. And so and this is a really important point to remember. It’s very</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:20,319 –&gt; 00:05:26,319<br>reasonable to think of the RTT the roundtrip time as being essentially constant when there are many</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:26,319 –&gt; 00:05:32,240<br>flows. There are minor fluctuations when a packet is dropped but the rest of the time the congested</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:32,240 –&gt; 00:05:40,720<br>buffer is full. So as a consequence we can assume that the RTT stays constant for packets passing</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:40,720 –&gt; 00:05:46,639<br>through the congested router. This means that the throughput of a flow which which in each cycle is</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:46,639 –&gt; 00:05:52,800<br>equal to its window size divided by RTT will be directly proportional to the window size. In other</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:52,800 –&gt; 00:06:00,560<br>words the average throughput is the average window size divided by the constant RTT. You should contrast</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:00,560 –&gt; 00:06:05,279<br>this with the single flow case that we saw in the last video which was completely different.</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:06,319 –&gt; 00:06:13,919<br>We saw that the RTT changed in lockstep with the AIMDs sort-tooth. In both cases we can accurately</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:13,920 –&gt; 00:06:19,280<br>say that the throughput equals the window size divided by the RTT but in the single flow case the</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:19,280 –&gt; 00:06:25,920<br>window size moves in lockstep with the RTT whereas in the multiple flow case the window size varies</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:25,920 –&gt; 00:06:32,879<br>but the RTT stays constant. One more thing for me to point out in the picture. You may have noticed</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:32,879 –&gt; 00:06:38,879<br>that I’m drawing the sort-tooth a little differently in this video. When I drew it for a single flow</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:38,879 –&gt; 00:06:45,040<br>the top edge was curved because RTT increased with window size. Each horizontal step was longer than</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:45,040 –&gt; 00:06:50,879<br>the one before. When we have multiple flows we can assume that the RTT is constant and so each</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:50,879 –&gt; 00:06:55,519<br>horizontal step is the same length and the sort-tooth is a triangle with straight edges.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:58,399 –&gt; 00:07:03,920<br>Now let’s look at the throughput of a flow. The throughput is simply the number of bytes or packets</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:03,920 –&gt; 00:07:09,280<br>it sends per second. In the first RTT it sends three packets when the packets are successfully</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:09,280 –&gt; 00:07:15,040<br>acknowledged it can send four packets in the next RTT and so on. You can see the way the throughput</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:15,040 –&gt; 00:07:21,200<br>is inversely proportional to the RTT. It’s worth asking how the throughput depends on the drop</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:21,200 –&gt; 00:07:28,560<br>probability as well. So I’m now going to show you a simple intuitive geometric relationship between</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:28,560 –&gt; 00:07:36,480<br>throughput and RTT and the drop probability. Here is our familiar AIMD model showing the</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:36,480 –&gt; 00:07:41,920<br>sort-tooth going through the additive increase, multiplicative decrease. I’m assuming we’ve entered</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:41,920 –&gt; 00:07:48,160<br>the AIMD phase and each time the window size reaches W max the buffer fills and a packet is dropped.</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:48,160 –&gt; 00:07:53,120<br>The window size is half the W max over 2 and remember there is a packet dropper at each peak of</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:53,120 –&gt; 00:07:59,920<br>the sort-tooth leading to a halving of the window size. The first observation is that the shaded</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:59,920 –&gt; 00:08:06,240<br>area shown here tells us how many packets we send in one cycle between two successive packet drops.</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:06,879 –&gt; 00:08:11,680<br>The line is really a staircase of window sizes with the window size increasing by one at each step.</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:13,280 –&gt; 00:08:20,399<br>The width of the shaded area is RTT times W max over 2 because it takes W max over 2 steps for</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:20,399 –&gt; 00:08:27,679<br>the window size to climb from W max over 2 back to W max again. Remember we’re assuming RTT</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:27,679 –&gt; 00:08:34,079<br>is a constant because there are lots of flows in the networks. The height of the shaded area is W max</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:34,079 –&gt; 00:08:42,240<br>and so the area A is simply 3 over 8 times W max squared. One way to think about it is that the</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:42,240 –&gt; 00:08:48,960<br>lower square is W max over 2 on each side so it has an area of W max squared over 4. The area is 1.5</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:48,960 –&gt; 00:08:55,120<br>times the size of the lower square. 1.5 times the quarter is 3 eighths so A equals 3 eighths of</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:55,120 –&gt; 00:09:03,519<br>W max squared. Now we know A we can write an expression for throughput because we know that we send</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:03,519 –&gt; 00:09:12,800<br>A bytes every W max over 2 times RTT seconds. Thruppard equals A divided by W max over 2 RTT.</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:13,199 –&gt; 00:09:20,479<br>The second observation that we can make is that we know the relationship between area A and the</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:20,479 –&gt; 00:09:26,159<br>packet drop probability. This is because exactly one packet is dropped every time we send A packets.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:26,719 –&gt; 00:09:32,959<br>In other words P equals 1 over A. We’re now ready to derive the throughput as a function of RTT and P.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:34,719 –&gt; 00:09:39,839<br>In practice we don’t know what W max is but because we know A as a function of P we can substitute</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:39,840 –&gt; 00:09:42,879<br>P into the equation and we end up with a rate equation that looks like this.</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:45,040 –&gt; 00:09:52,960<br>Thruppard equals the square root of 3 over 2 divided by RTT times the square root of P.</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:54,720 –&gt; 00:09:58,480<br>So look at it for a moment it’s more than just an equation. It tells us something about the</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:58,480 –&gt; 00:10:03,680<br>property of AIMD when we have a large number of flows. It tells us first that the rate that a</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:03,680 –&gt; 00:10:09,120<br>flow experience is proportional to 1 over its RTT. In other words the bigger the RTT the lower the</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:09,120 –&gt; 00:10:15,120<br>rate. It means that when we’re communicating with a server that’s further away we can expect a lower</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:15,120 –&gt; 00:10:20,960<br>rate. This is not the property that we want from a congestion control algorithm. We don’t necessarily</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:20,960 –&gt; 00:10:26,159<br>want to penalize flows that are further away and so this is generally considered a weakness of AIMD.</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:28,080 –&gt; 00:10:33,120<br>The second thing to notice about the throughput equation is that throughput is quite sensitive to</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:33,120 –&gt; 00:10:41,039<br>the drop probability 2, 1 over square root of P. It also might seem a little paradoxical. If the drop</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:41,039 –&gt; 00:10:47,120<br>probability goes to 0 does that mean the rate goes to infinity? But if you think about it this is</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:47,120 –&gt; 00:10:52,320<br>exactly what AIMD does. If there are no drops the window size will just keep growing and growing</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:52,320 –&gt; 00:10:56,960<br>forever and the window size will tend to infinity. In other words there will be no breaks on the</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:56,960 –&gt; 00:11:03,120<br>sender and it will send as fast as it possibly can all the time. This confirms what we already know</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:03,120 –&gt; 00:11:09,920<br>which is the packet drops are an essential part of how AIMD congestion control works. The packet</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:09,920 –&gt; 00:11:15,120<br>drops indicate to the sender that the window sizes open up too far and we have too many outstanding</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:15,120 –&gt; 00:11:20,480<br>packets in the networks. We need to ratchet it down and that is what congestion control is all about.</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:20,800 –&gt; 00:11:30,960<br>So in summary what have we learned about AIMD so far? We’ve learned that the throughput of an AIMD</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:30,960 –&gt; 00:11:37,680<br>flow is sensitive to the drop probability and very sensitive to the RTT. We’ve learned that when</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:37,680 –&gt; 00:11:43,440<br>the network is carrying many flows each flow follows the AIMD rules just like the single flow.</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:44,080 –&gt; 00:11:49,279<br>The window will contract and expand according to the AIMD equations while the sender probes how</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:49,279 –&gt; 00:11:53,519<br>many bytes it can safely place into the pipe between the sender and the receiver.</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:55,600 –&gt; 00:11:59,919<br>We’ve also learned that if the bottleneck contains packets belonging to many different flows</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:59,919 –&gt; 00:12:06,079<br>then the buffer is going to remain highly occupied all the time. This means the RTT seen by packets is</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:06,079 –&gt; 00:12:10,000<br>about the same and we can safely assume RTT is constant in this case.</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:12,959 –&gt; 00:12:17,120<br>Now you’ve learned about AIMD you’re going to see in the next few videos that it is one of the</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:17,120 –&gt; 00:12:23,440<br>main mechanisms underlying TCP’s congestion control algorithms. There are quite a few other</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:23,440 –&gt; 00:12:28,480<br>mechanisms that we’re going to be learning about two over the next few videos AIMD is one of them.</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:28,480 –&gt; 00:12:31,759<br>You’re going to be learning that there are lots of other tricks in the TCP toolbox that have</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:31,759 –&gt; 00:12:36,960<br>been introduced over the years to turn it into an extremely effective congestion control mechanism.</p>
