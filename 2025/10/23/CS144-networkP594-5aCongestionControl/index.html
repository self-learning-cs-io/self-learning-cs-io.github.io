<h2 id="title-CS144-networkP594-5aCongestionControl-md"><a href="#title-CS144-networkP594-5aCongestionControl-md" class="headerlink" title="title: CS144-networkP594-5aCongestionControl.md"></a>title: CS144-networkP594-5aCongestionControl.md</h2><p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,639<br>So in this video, I talk about congestion control, particularly the basic motivation for</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,639 –&gt; 00:00:08,880<br>congestion control and transport protocols in particles in general, and then walk through the</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,880 –&gt; 00:00:14,880<br>first example of a protocol that really identified and tackled this problem with TCP,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,880 –&gt; 00:00:19,839<br>particularly version of TCP called TCP Tahoe. And I’ll talk about the first mechanism</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,839 –&gt; 00:00:23,280<br>that TCP Tahoe uses to try and deal with congestion, something called slow start.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:24,080 –&gt; 00:00:32,160<br>So the basic motivation for congestion control is that flow control tells an endpoint, say,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,799 –&gt; 00:00:37,520<br>it’s going to tell Boston’s going to tell San Francisco the amount of data they can accept.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:37,520 –&gt; 00:00:43,760<br>And so flow control specifies the limitations of the endpoint.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:45,520 –&gt; 00:00:51,280<br>However, it can very well be that this node in Boston is able to receive data much, much faster</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:51,280 –&gt; 00:00:57,840<br>than the network can support it. So for example, while this node in Boston might have a buffer that</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:57,840 –&gt; 00:01:08,560<br>allows it to receive 100 packets per RTT, per RTT, it could be that some bottleneck link on the</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:08,560 –&gt; 00:01:13,760<br>path from San Francisco to Boston can really only support about five packets per RTT.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:14,719 –&gt; 00:01:18,719<br>And so the idea is that if San Francisco communicates with Boston, this node in San Francisco</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:18,719 –&gt; 00:01:23,439<br>communicates with the node in Boston at a rate which flow control would allow, then it’s going to</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:23,439 –&gt; 00:01:27,359<br>send packets much faster than it can support. Most of these packets are going to be dropped and it’s</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:27,359 –&gt; 00:01:32,159<br>going to spend a lot of its time doing retransmission sooner to cover from these heavy errors. You don’t</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:32,159 –&gt; 00:01:37,599<br>want to saturate the network because everything will work less efficiently than if most packets arrive.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:37,599 –&gt; 00:01:40,879<br>You’ll require less control overhead. The rule would generally work better.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:43,359 –&gt; 00:01:47,840<br>And so the basic idea of congestion control is that endpoints should control their data rate</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:47,840 –&gt; 00:01:52,560<br>so that they do not overload the network. This would generally increase the performance of the network.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:55,439 –&gt; 00:01:59,760<br>So if we just take a step back in terms of congestion control, what really led to it as this very</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:59,760 –&gt; 00:02:05,439<br>important area of study and engineering in the internet, it all comes from TCP. So basically</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:05,439 –&gt; 00:02:10,000<br>history of TCP in 1974, established the through a handshake, you know, SIN, SIN, AC, AC,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:10,879 –&gt; 00:02:16,400<br>in 1978, TCP and IP were split, were split. It used to be that the internet, just at that point,</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:16,400 –&gt; 00:02:20,080<br>the ARPNet just supported TCP, but they realized, oh, we need to split them because we need stuff</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:20,080 –&gt; 00:02:26,480<br>like UDP. Then January 1, 1983, that was, you know, the switch day when suddenly the entire ARPNet</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:26,480 –&gt; 00:02:33,520<br>switched over to TCP IP, IPv4. Three years after that, the internet began to suffer congestion</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:33,520 –&gt; 00:02:40,159<br>collapse, where links were saturated. They were sending, you know, operating at line speed, yet no</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:40,240 –&gt; 00:02:46,400<br>worse useful work was being done. Instead, all the packets being transmitted were unnecessary</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:46,400 –&gt; 00:02:52,159<br>retransmissions or acknowledgments. So you’re seeing full utilization of links,</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:52,159 –&gt; 00:02:55,919<br>while simultaneously no application level throughput.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:57,359 –&gt; 00:03:02,560<br>So then van Jacobson in the seminal paper, fixed TCP, figured out what was going on,</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:03,680 –&gt; 00:03:08,879<br>and he published the seminal TCP paper, which described TCP Tahoe. So these names Tahoe and Reno,</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:10,159 –&gt; 00:03:18,319<br>come from the versions of hardware for Berkeley Unix that these TCP implementations occurred on.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:19,120 –&gt; 00:03:23,759<br>And so you read about Tahoe, Reno and the Nathlete started getting names like New Reno, Vegas,</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:23,759 –&gt; 00:03:31,039<br>Daytona, just to follow that theme. But Tahoe and Reno were denoted by versions of Berkeley Unix,</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:31,039 –&gt; 00:03:36,000<br>that were distributed in the hardware they were for. So then about a couple of years after this</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:36,000 –&gt; 00:03:40,560<br>for TCP Tahoe, a fast recovery and fast recovery transmit something that’s in a future TCP</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:40,560 –&gt; 00:03:46,080<br>version, I’ll talk about later, video TCP Reno, which are common today, but the time there are new ideas</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:46,080 –&gt; 00:03:52,080<br>were added. And so if you look, basically all TCP implementations today have the mechanisms that</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:52,080 –&gt; 00:03:56,879<br>are in TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno. And so we’re going to go through them in this series of videos.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:57,199 –&gt; 00:04:08,639<br>So there are basically three questions that a transport protocol needs to answer if it’s going to provide</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:08,639 –&gt; 00:04:14,719<br>reliable transport. The first is when should it send new data? That is when should it send data,</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:14,719 –&gt; 00:04:20,159<br>which it has never put on in our before? Second is when should it send a retransmission? When should</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:20,159 –&gt; 00:04:25,519<br>it try to retransmit data it has sent before? And finally, when should it send acknowledgments for</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:25,599 –&gt; 00:04:29,519<br>data that it successfully received? These are these basic things of stew. When is it going to generate</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:29,519 –&gt; 00:04:34,479<br>packets? Whether they’re data packets, retransmissions of data packets, or acknowledgment packets?</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:36,240 –&gt; 00:04:41,199<br>Now of course, often we talk about data acknowledgment packets as being independent, but in TCP they’re not.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:41,199 –&gt; 00:04:45,839<br>The acknowledgments are simply a field in the header, and you can of course pick you back data</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:45,839 –&gt; 00:04:49,039<br>and acknowledge them. But often we just talk about data acknowledgments separately,</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:49,039 –&gt; 00:04:52,719<br>just pretending that the flow is unidirectional, though often it might not be, it might be</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:52,720 –&gt; 00:04:58,000<br>bidirectional. The point being that it can be that you have no data this time, but you do need to send</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:58,000 –&gt; 00:05:05,760<br>an acknowledgment. So what did TCP look like before TCP Tahoe? So essentially what happens is</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:05,760 –&gt; 00:05:10,160<br>you set up a connection through a handshake, and at endpoint now has the flow control window size,</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:10,160 –&gt; 00:05:19,360<br>to be noted by the window field of a TCP header. And so what, pre- Tahoe, what TCP would do is this</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:19,439 –&gt; 00:05:22,639<br>seems like a simple thing. It would just send the full window of packets. So if the window set up</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:22,639 –&gt; 00:05:29,120<br>ha, I’m 30 kilobytes, it would send 30 kilobytes worth of packets. So this is obeying the flow control.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:30,080 –&gt; 00:05:36,800<br>It would then start a retransmit timer for each packet, and then if it didn’t receive an acknowledgment</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:36,800 –&gt; 00:05:41,040<br>for that packet by the time the retransmit timer fired, it would then retransmit that packet.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:42,480 –&gt; 00:05:48,080<br>And so the basic problem this encounters, what happens if the flow control window is much larger</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:48,159 –&gt; 00:05:52,639<br>than with the network and support? It might be that your endpoint has space for 30 kilobytes,</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:52,639 –&gt; 00:05:57,279<br>but the link has already saturated. You can’t suddenly just dump another 30 kilobytes on it.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:57,279 –&gt; 00:06:03,039<br>I mean, these numbers might seem small now, but back then these were, you had relatively slow</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:03,039 –&gt; 00:06:06,079<br>links in comparison to today’s speed. So think of this more of your windows suddenly</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:06,079 –&gt; 00:06:11,120<br>were advertised to 30 megabytes. You don’t understand when I dump 30 megabytes onto your DSL or your</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:11,120 –&gt; 00:06:18,000<br>cable modem link immediately. So if you implement that algorithm, you just send the window of packets</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:18,000 –&gt; 00:06:23,120<br>what happens? Well, so here’s a picture. So here it’s showing on the x-axis this time in seconds,</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:23,120 –&gt; 00:06:28,560<br>and the y-axis is the packet sequence number in terms of kilobytes. So the sequence number of the</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:28,560 –&gt; 00:06:34,399<br>byte that TCP has sent. And so what you see is on connection establishment, it immediately sends a</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:34,399 –&gt; 00:06:40,879<br>full buffer of packets about 20 kilobytes worth. And then it’s getting some acknowledgments</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:40,879 –&gt; 00:06:47,040<br>so it’s sending some more data, but then suddenly its window is a certain size, the flow control window,</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:47,760 –&gt; 00:06:59,040<br>and it hasn’t received an acknowledgment for this segment here. And so at this point, TCP is blocked,</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:59,040 –&gt; 00:07:03,759<br>right? The dots are showing the packet that are transmitted, so at this point it’s blocked in that</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:03,759 –&gt; 00:07:08,160<br>it is sent up to the last acknowledged byte plus the window size, and it can’t send anymore.</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:08,160 –&gt; 00:07:14,000<br>And the reason is that this packet probably was lost. So then here’s the time out.</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:14,720 –&gt; 00:07:24,160<br>And it retransments that packet. Then as you can see, it’s able to send a whole bunch more packets,</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:24,160 –&gt; 00:07:28,240<br>it gets a whole bunch of acknowledgments, or it gets a cumulative acknowledgment lying in the</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:28,240 –&gt; 00:07:34,959<br>window to move forward, etc, etc. But the basic point to see here is that there are these huge sawtooth</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:35,680 –&gt; 00:07:42,639<br>that you see big bursts of packets followed by idle timeouts. Big bursts of packets followed by</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:42,639 –&gt; 00:07:48,800<br>idle timeouts. And that many of these packets are redundant. Like this particular packet here is sent</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:48,800 –&gt; 00:07:55,439<br>three times. Now this one is also sent three times. So you’re seeing lots of additional</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:55,439 –&gt; 00:08:01,759<br>retransmissions. And overall, the protocol is not performing very well. It’s sending all these</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:01,759 –&gt; 00:08:05,839<br>packets, but if you look at the actual slope of this line, the sense of the data out sending,</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:05,839 –&gt; 00:08:13,119<br>the slope isn’t very high. If TCP were operating at line speed, operating at the correct speed,</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:13,679 –&gt; 00:08:17,759<br>it should be following this line here. But instead, it’s following the line with the much slower slope.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:17,759 –&gt; 00:08:23,439<br>It’s actually sending data much slower than it should be able to. This is what was observed that</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:23,439 –&gt; 00:08:30,159<br>TCP is very slow because it’s sending lots of retransmissions unnecessarily, and there are lots of timeouts.</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:30,240 –&gt; 00:08:40,320<br>So based on this, then Jacobson proposed three improvements. The first is the idea of a congestion</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:40,320 –&gt; 00:08:46,240<br>window. The second is better timeout estimation and the last is self-clocking. I’m going to walk</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:46,240 –&gt; 00:08:50,879<br>through each of those. The congestion window, and talk about in this video and future videos,</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:50,879 –&gt; 00:08:58,879<br>I’ll talk about timeout estimation and self-clocking. So the congestion window.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:00,959 –&gt; 00:09:04,879<br>So the basic insight is that the flow control window is only about the endpoint.</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:05,600 –&gt; 00:09:12,159<br>And so what you want to do is have TCP estimate a congestion window that is how much can the network</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:12,159 –&gt; 00:09:16,639<br>support when I, in the sense of how quickly can I send data and have the network deliver it reliably.</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:17,519 –&gt; 00:09:20,959<br>And then the sender window is going to be the minimum of these two. In the sense of there’s no point</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:20,959 –&gt; 00:09:24,559<br>sending data faster than the network can support, and nor is there any point sending data faster than</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:24,639 –&gt; 00:09:30,959<br>the end-host can support. And then what you do is based on this idea of a congestion window,</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:30,959 –&gt; 00:09:36,159<br>you separate how you behave in terms of sending packets in the size of this congestion window into</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:36,159 –&gt; 00:09:42,719<br>two states. The first is something called slow start. The second is congestion of winds.</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:44,000 –&gt; 00:09:48,559<br>You slow start when you’re doing connection startup or when there’s a packet timeout. When something</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:48,559 –&gt; 00:09:54,399<br>is gone very wrong and you want to just back off completely and then figure out what it is the</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:54,399 –&gt; 00:10:00,000<br>network can support. Conjection of winds in contrast is when the network, when you’re behaving pretty</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:00,000 –&gt; 00:10:05,199<br>well, that is you’re operating close to the network capacity. And so you don’t want to start sending</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:05,199 –&gt; 00:10:11,279<br>things much faster or much slower. You’re operating close to what you think the congestion window of the</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:11,279 –&gt; 00:10:22,000<br>network is. So the idea of slow start is that what the node does is rather than start its window at the</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:22,000 –&gt; 00:10:29,519<br>flow control window size, it starts its window at a size of a minimum maximum segment size. So basically</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:29,519 –&gt; 00:10:36,639<br>one on packets worth of data today, nodes might start with two or four. There’s some rules about that</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:37,039 –&gt; 00:10:45,199<br>two through two through four, but the original version started at one. And then every time a packet</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:45,199 –&gt; 00:10:50,639<br>acknowledge, every time you receive a new acknowledgement, you increase this window by the maximum</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:50,639 –&gt; 00:10:55,360<br>segment size. And what this means in terms of practice is that in the first round trip time, you’re</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:55,360 –&gt; 00:10:59,199<br>going to send a single packet, they’ll be acknowledged. Now your segment size, now your window size is</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:59,199 –&gt; 00:11:03,279<br>two. So you’ll send two packets. They’ll both be acknowledged. You increase by two, now they’ll send</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:03,279 –&gt; 00:11:07,279<br>four packets. They’ll be acknowledged. You’ll then send eight packets. There’s this exponential growth.</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:08,159 –&gt; 00:11:14,159<br>And so that’s what you’re seeing here. See here’s one packet, two packets, or there’s one, two, four,</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:14,159 –&gt; 00:11:20,639<br>you know, eight, etc. This exponential growth scaling up. So in a logarithmic number of steps,</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:20,639 –&gt; 00:11:26,240<br>you can hopefully discover what is the congestion window size of the network. So this might seem,</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:26,240 –&gt; 00:11:30,319<br>I mean, exponential growth is not slow. And so the name is, it can be a little confusing.</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:30,320 –&gt; 00:11:34,080<br>The reason it’s called slow is that it’s slow compared to the prior, which is actually the</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:34,080 –&gt; 00:11:39,680<br>most faster mode of TCP today. But compared to sending an entire flow control window of packets,</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:39,680 –&gt; 00:11:45,440<br>doing this exponential scale up through a logarithmic number of steps was comparatively so. So</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:45,440 –&gt; 00:11:50,000<br>it’s interesting sort of historic compared to modern, modern idea.</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:53,840 –&gt; 00:11:58,240<br>And so we can see in this figure, this is also from Van Jacobson’s paper that</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:00,480 –&gt; 00:12:04,800<br>the packet sequence number, you know, is increasing this way and you see this exponential growth.</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:04,800 –&gt; 00:12:09,840<br>And then using slow start, you end up plus than the congestion avoidance state that I’ll talk about</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:09,840 –&gt; 00:12:14,400<br>in a moment. You end up hitting this nice steady state. And while it takes you a little bit of time</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:14,400 –&gt; 00:12:19,760<br>to discover what the line speed is, eventually the behavior of the protocol is very close to this</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:19,760 –&gt; 00:12:24,560<br>line speed. And it’s operating close to capacity. It’s not overwhelming it. And you’re not seeing</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:24,639 –&gt; 00:12:33,439<br>these sawtooths of terrible performance. So that’s the slow start state. So in the slow start state,</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:33,439 –&gt; 00:12:37,039<br>you are increasing the congestion window by a maximum segment size for each acknowledgment.</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:37,039 –&gt; 00:12:41,759<br>This leads to an exponential increase in the window size. The second state that you can be in</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:41,759 –&gt; 00:12:47,199<br>is called congestion avoidance. And in this model, when you’re in the congestion avoidance state,</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:47,280 –&gt; 00:12:55,759<br>you increase the congestion window by, and the maximum segment size squared divided by the</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:55,759 –&gt; 00:13:00,480<br>congestion window for each acknowledgment. The behavior results is rather than increase by</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:01,200 –&gt; 00:13:04,720<br>the window by a maximum segment size for each acknowledgment, you end up increasing the maximum</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:04,720 –&gt; 00:13:09,200<br>segment size for each round trip time. So it’s an additive increase. So rest this is growing the</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:09,200 –&gt; 00:13:14,240<br>window size exponentially. This is growing the window size linearly.</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:21,200 –&gt; 00:13:25,600<br>So we have these two states slow start congestion avoidance. How do we transition between them?</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:25,600 –&gt; 00:13:29,520<br>Well, really, there are these two goals. When you slow start to quickly find what the network</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:29,520 –&gt; 00:13:34,720<br>congestion capacity is that is how fast can we send things before the network enters congestion and</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:34,720 –&gt; 00:13:40,240<br>starts buffering packets and dropping packets. And so then once we are close to that capacity,</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:40,240 –&gt; 00:13:45,040<br>one is congestion avoidance to very carefully probe. So we’re below the congestion points,</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:45,040 –&gt; 00:13:49,600<br>let’s just start slowly increasing until we reach it, then maybe drop down a little bit and start</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:49,600 –&gt; 00:13:54,800<br>slowly increasing until we reach it. We basically can use that to stay close to that value and be close</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:54,800 –&gt; 00:13:59,759<br>to the network capacity. And we have three signals to accomplish this. The first is if we’re seeing</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:59,759 –&gt; 00:14:03,200<br>increasing acknowledgments, that means the data transfer is going well, maybe we can speed things</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:03,200 –&gt; 00:14:08,400<br>up a bit. The second is if we have duplicate acknowledgments, remember TSP using cumulative</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:08,400 –&gt; 00:14:11,920<br>acknowledgments. So if we’re seeing many acknowledgments for the same piece of data, that means TCP</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:11,920 –&gt; 00:14:16,640<br>is receiving segments, but one of them is missing. So this means something was lost or delayed.</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:17,440 –&gt; 00:14:21,360<br>The final signal is if there’s a timeout. If we set a whole bunch of packets or a window of packets</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:21,360 –&gt; 00:14:25,600<br>and we’ve heard nothing and there’s a timeout, that means something very wrong has happened. Or maybe</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:25,600 –&gt; 00:14:29,920<br>way off of what the congestion is moving the network has suddenly become congested because it itself</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:29,919 –&gt; 00:14:39,279<br>can have dynamic traffic. So this is the TCP Tahoe Finance Day machine. I’m going to walk through a</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:39,279 –&gt; 00:14:47,120<br>bit by bit. So when you open a TCP Tahoe connection, you start in the slow start state with a maximum</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:47,120 –&gt; 00:14:53,039<br>with a window of a maximum segment size and recall that your actual window will never grow larger</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:53,039 –&gt; 00:14:56,639<br>than your flow control window. The minimum of the flow control window and congestion control windows.</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:56,639 –&gt; 00:15:02,319<br>So this is controlling the congestion control window size. Then every time we’re in the slow start</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:02,319 –&gt; 00:15:09,600<br>state and we receive an acknowledgment, we increase the congestion window. This is C-wind</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:10,799 –&gt; 00:15:13,360<br>by the maximum segment size. So this is the exponential increase here.</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:13,680 –&gt; 00:15:29,919<br>Then we have a parameter SS threshold, which is this stands for slow start threshold. If the</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:29,919 –&gt; 00:15:35,039<br>congestion window grows larger than the slow start threshold, then we transition to the congestion</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:35,039 –&gt; 00:15:38,480<br>avoidance state. This means that hey, we suddenly have a big enough congestion window,</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:39,360 –&gt; 00:15:43,279<br>then we should slow down our growth. It’s a transition to congestion avoidance.</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:45,039 –&gt; 00:15:49,200<br>Now in the congestion avoidance state, if we receive an acknowledgment, we increase the congestion</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:49,200 –&gt; 00:15:54,480<br>window by a maximum segment size squared divided by the congestion window. This is the linear increase.</p>
<p>165<br>00:15:58,639 –&gt; 00:16:04,560<br>And so we see that the window size will look like this over time effectively. We’re here is when we</p>
<p>166<br>00:16:04,559 –&gt; 00:16:12,959<br>hit SS threshold. This part corresponds to this state. This part corresponds to this state.</p>
<p>167<br>00:16:17,279 –&gt; 00:16:22,559<br>But now what happens if we’re in the congestion avoidance state and this linear increase</p>
<p>168<br>00:16:23,679 –&gt; 00:16:28,000<br>goes beyond the congestion capacity of the network? Well, what’s going to happen is we’re going to</p>
<p>169<br>00:16:28,000 –&gt; 00:16:33,119<br>see a timeout or a triple duplicate act. A triple duplicate act, this implies a packet was lost.</p>
<p>170<br>00:16:34,080 –&gt; 00:16:41,919<br>We’re seeing these many acknowledgments. And so what T.C.B. Tahoe does on seeing either a timeout</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:41,919 –&gt; 00:16:49,919<br>or triple duplicate act is it resets the congestion window to be one and it sets the SS threshold</p>
<p>172<br>00:16:49,919 –&gt; 00:16:57,440<br>to be the old congestion window divided by two. And so what this is going to do is after we see</p>
<p>173<br>00:16:58,400 –&gt; 00:17:03,840<br>this linear growth and then at this point say we say a triple duplicate act. What will happen is</p>
<p>174<br>00:17:03,840 –&gt; 00:17:13,120<br>that T.C.B. Tahoe is going to set, these blue, is going to set SS threshold to be half of what the</p>
<p>175<br>00:17:13,120 –&gt; 00:17:24,320<br>congestion window is at that time. It’s then going to reenter a slow start, do an exponential increase</p>
<p>176<br>00:17:24,319 –&gt; 00:17:29,919<br>until it reaches this SS threshold, which point then SS threshold will then enter congestion</p>
<p>177<br>00:17:29,919 –&gt; 00:17:36,639<br>avoidance and do a linear increase. And so the way to think of this is that upon this triple duplicate</p>
<p>178<br>00:17:36,639 –&gt; 00:17:44,159<br>act or this timeout, the T.C.B. Tahoe is discovered what it thinks is too much, too fast of transmission</p>
<p>179<br>00:17:44,159 –&gt; 00:17:49,519<br>rates. Window is too big. So then what it does is it says, okay, I’m going to exponentially grow my</p>
<p>180<br>00:17:49,519 –&gt; 00:17:54,559<br>window until I reach half of that point and then I’ll start linearly increasing it. Is that way</p>
<p>181<br>00:17:54,559 –&gt; 00:17:59,440<br>you can hopefully quickly get back to close to capacity and a logarithmic number of steps,</p>
<p>182<br>00:17:59,440 –&gt; 00:18:03,839<br>but then you don’t want to get too close and so you start at half of what that old value was and</p>
<p>183<br>00:18:03,839 –&gt; 00:18:08,559<br>then start linearly increasing again. So this is the basic finance data machine for T.C.B. Tahoe.</p>
<p>184<br>00:18:09,200 –&gt; 00:18:15,200<br>So here I will walk through a simple example. So you start with a sender and let’s just say SS threshold</p>
<p>185<br>00:18:15,200 –&gt; 00:18:25,759<br>is equal to four when it starts up. So it’s first it’s going to send a single T.C.B. segment, single maximum</p>
<p>186<br>00:18:25,759 –&gt; 00:18:31,360<br>segment size segment. The receiver, let’s just call this one. I’ll number them as packets for simplicity.</p>
<p>187<br>00:18:31,360 –&gt; 00:18:40,080<br>The receiver sends an acknowledgement. So at this point here our congestion window is equal to one.</p>
<p>188<br>00:18:40,559 –&gt; 00:18:48,399<br>Now since when the slow start state it’ll become two. It becomes two. And so the sender can send two</p>
<p>189<br>00:18:48,400 –&gt; 00:18:56,960<br>packets. Three and four. The receiver receives them. I’m sorry. Two and three.</p>
<p>190<br>00:19:09,200 –&gt; 00:19:13,440<br>The receiver receives them sends acknowledgements. Now our congestion window is four.</p>
<p>191<br>00:19:13,680 –&gt; 00:19:23,680<br>Which means that we will send four packets.</p>
<p>192<br>00:19:27,519 –&gt; 00:19:32,960<br>Which will be four, five, six, seven. Now at this point congestion window has reached the slow start</p>
<p>193<br>00:19:32,960 –&gt; 00:19:40,000<br>threshold. Which means that T.C.B. Tahoe is going to exit this the slow start state and enter the</p>
<p>194<br>00:19:40,000 –&gt; 00:19:46,880<br>congestion of wooden state. And so when these acknowledgements come back it’s going to increase the</p>
<p>195<br>00:19:46,880 –&gt; 00:19:55,359<br>window by one. And so rather than send eight packets congestion window will be five. And it will send</p>
<p>196<br>00:19:55,359 –&gt; 00:20:02,880<br>five packets. So let’s just say I’ll just draw one arrow here of packets eight nine ten eleven twelve.</p>
<p>197<br>00:20:04,240 –&gt; 00:20:08,079<br>Now let’s say that packet eight is lost. It’s dropped in the network. We’ve actually reached</p>
<p>198<br>00:20:08,079 –&gt; 00:20:13,759<br>our congestion point. Well what will happen? Well the receiver is going to acknowledge eight.</p>
<p>199<br>00:20:14,240 –&gt; 00:20:17,679<br>It’s going to acknowledge that eight was received. Remember this T.C.B. is the aqueduct. Just say</p>
<p>200<br>00:20:17,679 –&gt; 00:20:21,759<br>nine but I’ll just write eight for simplicity sake. It’s going to say a high I’ve received eight.</p>
<p>201<br>00:20:22,879 –&gt; 00:20:31,759<br>Then ten eleven and twelve arrive. Now T.C.P. is going to then send acknowledgement eight eight</p>
<p>202<br>00:20:33,679 –&gt; 00:20:37,439<br>eight. Because it’s cumulative acknowledgements that hasn’t received nine can only say I’ve received</p>
<p>203<br>00:20:37,440 –&gt; 00:20:41,120<br>eight. I’ve received eight received eight. This is a triple duplicate acknowledgement. We have three</p>
<p>204<br>00:20:41,120 –&gt; 00:20:47,360<br>duplicates. So what now T.C.P. Tahoe is going to do is is going to transition back to the slow start</p>
<p>205<br>00:20:47,360 –&gt; 00:20:56,320<br>state. My congestion window is five. So I’m going to set my slow start threshold to be equal to half</p>
<p>206<br>00:20:56,320 –&gt; 00:21:01,600<br>of the congestion window. So let’s just say we’re going to set it to basically it’s 2.5.</p>
<p>207<br>00:21:02,559 –&gt; 00:21:06,319<br>And enter the slow start state again. So I’ll send a single packet.</p>
<p>208<br>00:21:09,839 –&gt; 00:21:16,079<br>Now this packet is going to be sent on a timeout. So essentially I’m waiting for the acknowledgement</p>
<p>209<br>00:21:16,079 –&gt; 00:21:22,879<br>nine. I haven’t heard it all time out and I will send I will resend nine. Then that’s the number</p>
<p>210<br>00:21:22,879 –&gt; 00:21:30,399<br>packets I can have outstanding. Then if an acknowledgement for nine comes back I can set my congestion</p>
<p>211<br>00:21:30,400 –&gt; 00:21:38,720<br>window to two. But this acknowledge won’t be just be for nine because it’s received 10, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>212<br>00:21:38,720 –&gt; 00:21:43,360<br>So that acknowledgement’s actually going to say is acknowledge 12. So I now have my congestion</p>
<p>213<br>00:21:43,360 –&gt; 00:21:50,080<br>window to two. I know 12 has been received. I can send 13 and 14 and I’m back in the slow start</p>
<p>214<br>00:21:50,080 –&gt; 00:21:55,200<br>state. Until I reach this SS threshold which final transition back to congestion of winds.</p>
<p>215<br>00:21:55,200 –&gt; 00:22:01,519<br>So that’s a basic walkthrough of TCP Tahoe and how it behaves. It’s moving between slow start and</p>
<p>216<br>00:22:01,519 –&gt; 00:22:07,279<br>congestion avoidance and how it’s using triple duplicate acts in order to infer that something has</p>
<p>217<br>00:22:07,279 –&gt; 00:22:11,200<br>gone wrong and return back to the slow start state. It’s using that to infer that there’s congestion</p>
<p>218<br>00:22:11,200 –&gt; 00:22:12,799<br>in slow down.</p>
