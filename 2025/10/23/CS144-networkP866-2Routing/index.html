                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,440<br>Continuing on a theme of routing, in this video I’m going to tell you about a distance vector protocol.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,440 –&gt; 00:00:13,919<br>Distance vector protocols are one in which the routers maintain a vector of their distances to a given or to all of the other routers.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,919 –&gt; 00:00:25,120<br>And then iteratively through a distributed algorithm they converge on finding the shortest path or the lowest cost spanning tree from them to every other router.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:25,120 –&gt; 00:00:34,719<br>And we’re going to see a specific example of this, what’s known as the Bellamann Ford algorithm, which is the most commonly used algorithm in these distance vector protocols.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:35,679 –&gt; 00:00:42,400<br>So the particular problem we’re going to address is how can routers work together to find the minimum cost spanning tree?</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:42,400 –&gt; 00:00:47,840<br>Here’s an example that I’ve shown in green here as the minimum cost spanning tree for this particular graph.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:48,480 –&gt; 00:00:53,520<br>Notice that this is equivalent to finding the minimum cost spanning tree amongst just the routers.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:53,520 –&gt; 00:00:59,359<br>It didn’t matter whether I included the end hosts because really in the end we’re just building the spanning tree amongst the routers.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:59,359 –&gt; 00:01:03,120<br>So in the rest of the examples I’m just going to confine myself to that.</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:03,120 –&gt; 00:01:06,560<br>So now let’s look at the distributed Bellamann Ford algorithm.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:06,560 –&gt; 00:01:14,000<br>And in this example we’re going to use the case of trying to find the minimum cost spanning tree to R8.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:14,319 –&gt; 00:01:18,959<br>Just to remind you in the previous slide this was the router in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:18,959 –&gt; 00:01:24,799<br>So this green spanning tree shown here is the minimum cost spanning tree for everybody to reach R8.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:25,439 –&gt; 00:01:32,480<br>So remember that in general all of the routers are going to be building the lowest cost spanning tree to reach all of the other routers.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:32,480 –&gt; 00:01:37,920<br>So we’re just taking one specific case here of finding that minimum cost spanning tree to R8.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:38,799 –&gt; 00:01:46,079<br>So in the Bellamann Ford algorithm we’re going to assume that the routers know the cost of the link to each of their neighbors</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:46,079 –&gt; 00:01:49,680<br>so that there is a metric and a cost associated with using that link.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:49,680 –&gt; 00:01:57,439<br>And we’re going to assume that router R sub i is going to maintain the value of the cost to reach R8.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:58,480 –&gt; 00:02:05,040<br>So at any one instance it’s going to keep a sense of its current lowest cost to reach R sub 8.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:05,120 –&gt; 00:02:14,879<br>So router R a is going to be c sub i. So we’re going to have a vector c which is going to contain the seven costs of the seven routers R1 through R7</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:15,680 –&gt; 00:02:21,759<br>of their current cost to reach R8 and this is the distance vector to reach R8.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:22,879 –&gt; 00:02:27,759<br>Initially the algorithm is going to set this vector to all values of infinity.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:28,159 –&gt; 00:02:36,000<br>And then every t seconds, so starting after the first t seconds R i is going to send c i to its neighbors.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:36,000 –&gt; 00:02:41,199<br>Another of each router is going to send the cost to reach R8 to each of its neighbors.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:43,199 –&gt; 00:02:48,879<br>If R i at any time learns of a lower cost path it’s going to update this value c sub i.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:48,879 –&gt; 00:02:55,359<br>So if after t seconds it hears a lower cost path to reach R8 it’s going to update its value</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:55,360 –&gt; 00:02:58,400<br>and then we’re going to repeat and we’re just going to keep repeating forever.</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:00,240 –&gt; 00:03:05,600<br>Okay let’s look at this as how this would work on the graph. And remember there’s a natural extension</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:05,600 –&gt; 00:03:12,560<br>to calculate this for R1 through R7 we just exchange all of the values. I’ve just shown you the one example here.</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:13,440 –&gt; 00:03:18,160<br>Now let’s look at a concrete example and we’re going to look at this particular graph here which</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:18,160 –&gt; 00:03:22,960<br>I’ve annotated with some cost. They’re different from the cost before. There’s a matter of the particular values</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:22,960 –&gt; 00:03:29,120<br>or how they came about whether they’re for the represent the delay of using a link or the</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:29,120 –&gt; 00:03:33,360<br>the price of using a link. They’re just values and we’re going to try and find the minimum cost</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:33,360 –&gt; 00:03:38,159<br>spanning tree using the Bellman Ford algorithm. So remember in the Bellman Ford algorithm we start out</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:38,159 –&gt; 00:03:44,240<br>with a distance vector to reach R8 of all the value set to infinity. So R1 thinks it costs</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:44,719 –&gt; 00:03:50,719<br>it’s infinite to start with R2 and so on. They all think that the cost is infinite in order to reach</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:50,719 –&gt; 00:03:55,520<br>R8. Okay so that’s where we’re going to begin and we’re going to go through and see waves of</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:55,520 –&gt; 00:04:00,240<br>information propagating through so that we can update these and steadily converge on what the</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:00,240 –&gt; 00:04:06,960<br>minimum cost spanning tree is in order to reach R8. So in the next step that information is going</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:06,960 –&gt; 00:04:13,919<br>to propagate outwards from R8. So this information here is going to tell us in that first wave that</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:14,799 –&gt; 00:04:21,839<br>R8 can be reached in one hop from these routers. R3 is going to learn that it can get there in 4.</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:22,479 –&gt; 00:04:28,399<br>That’s over the direct path. R5 will learn it can get there in 6. R6 over here will learn that it can</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:28,399 –&gt; 00:04:34,479<br>get there in 2 and R7 will learn that it can get there in 1. So they’re the costs in that first step.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:35,039 –&gt; 00:04:43,839<br>And so R3 will update its own value. 4, 6, 1 and 2 respectively. And now they will advertise</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:43,839 –&gt; 00:04:50,799<br>those values on in the next round of the algorithm. So that information is going to propagate out here</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:50,799 –&gt; 00:04:56,799<br>into the next hop. So R4 is going to learn in the next in the next iteration of the algorithm</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:56,799 –&gt; 00:05:04,399<br>that it can get there at a cost of 2 via R7. So 2 via R7 could get also get there at a cost of 6 via</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:04,399 –&gt; 00:05:09,759<br>R6. That’s a higher value so it’s going to ignore that one. R2 can get there at a cost of 7,</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:09,759 –&gt; 00:05:18,000<br>6 plus 1. So that’s 7 going via R5. And R1 is going to learn that it can get there at a cost of 8</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:18,000 –&gt; 00:05:23,759<br>via R3. Okay, so it’s tempting to think that we’re done at this point because every router is heard of</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:23,759 –&gt; 00:05:28,639<br>value. But of course this is going to keep going because this information is going to propagate</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:28,639 –&gt; 00:05:34,000<br>further. In the next time this news is going to propagate this way, this news is going to propagate</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:34,000 –&gt; 00:05:38,879<br>this way, this news will propagate this way and so on. So everyone is going to hear more values</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:38,959 –&gt; 00:05:43,600<br>in the next round. Let me clear that to make it a little bit clearer and see what happens in the</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:43,600 –&gt; 00:05:51,040<br>next round. So this is the values that I just showed you. Just as an example, R1 had learned,</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:51,040 –&gt; 00:06:01,120<br>if you remember, that it can get to R8 via R3 at a cost of 8. So it has that value 8 going via R3,</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:01,199 –&gt; 00:06:08,959<br>for example. Okay, so now what happens, you can see that we found out all of the two hop</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:08,959 –&gt; 00:06:14,319<br>information. So this is really like the two hop information. In the next iteration, we’re going to</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:14,319 –&gt; 00:06:21,199<br>find out the three hop information. Let’s see what this three hop information is. Well, based on this,</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:21,920 –&gt; 00:06:26,240<br>the ones that are going to change that I’ve shown in red here, let’s focus on those. R2,</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:27,040 –&gt; 00:06:34,079<br>which previously thought that the lowest cost path was of cost 7 going via R5, it’s going to</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:34,079 –&gt; 00:06:40,639<br>learn about this three hop path because R4 is going to advertise to it the value 6. And so it’s</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:40,639 –&gt; 00:06:45,600<br>going to hear about this value that it can get there at a cost of 6 going via R4. So that’s going</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:45,600 –&gt; 00:06:52,560<br>to be its new value and that’s the one here. Similarly, R5 is going to learn about the three hop</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:53,199 –&gt; 00:06:58,959<br>path, which goes via R4. It’s going to learn about this one here. So previously, the lowest cost path</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:58,959 –&gt; 00:07:07,439<br>was a value 6. Now it’s going to learn one of value 4 of cost 4 going via R4. So that’s this entry</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:07,439 –&gt; 00:07:12,319<br>here that it just learned about. So the first three hop path that was actually lower cost than the two</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:12,319 –&gt; 00:07:18,160<br>hop path. Let’s see what happens in the next iteration. In the next iteration of the algorithm,</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:18,160 –&gt; 00:07:23,680<br>the news is spreading out further to the four hop paths. And in the four hop paths, for example,</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:23,680 –&gt; 00:07:33,520<br>R1 is going to learn of the four hop path that goes 1, 2, 3, 4, which is of cost 7 because R2</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:33,520 –&gt; 00:07:39,120<br>will have propagated on the information that it can get there at a cost of 6. So 6 plus 1 is 7.</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:39,120 –&gt; 00:07:44,320<br>So if it goes via R2, it can get there at a cost of 7. So that’s this one here.</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:44,319 –&gt; 00:07:53,680<br>R2 has just learned in this next hop that there is an even better path. And we can see this one here.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:53,680 –&gt; 00:07:58,399<br>I’m going to draw this one in green to make it a little bit clearer, which goes via here. And that</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:58,399 –&gt; 00:08:05,920<br>is a cost 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it’s just learning that it can get there at 5 if it goes via R5.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:07,120 –&gt; 00:08:11,759<br>So the interesting thing here is these two bits of information are actually inconsistent because</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:11,759 –&gt; 00:08:17,199<br>the algorithm hasn’t converged. The news of this particular opportunity hasn’t made it to R1 yet.</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:17,199 –&gt; 00:08:25,120<br>So we’ll see that happen in the next step. In the next step, R1 is going to learn of the newer value,</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:25,120 –&gt; 00:08:36,159<br>which is to go via that it can reach it in a cost of 6 going on this path here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:36,159 –&gt; 00:08:43,519<br>cost of 6 going via R2. Oops, I’ve got a little bit of a mistake there. Okay, that should be via R2.</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:46,159 –&gt; 00:08:51,279<br>So now it appears that we’re done. How do we know that we’re done? Well, we can look at it and see</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:51,279 –&gt; 00:08:56,399<br>that we can’t find any lower cost paths. That tells us that we’re done. But you could also see that</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:56,399 –&gt; 00:09:02,480<br>this will finish. It can’t go any further. So long as we’ve explored the maximum hop length in</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:02,480 –&gt; 00:09:07,440<br>the network and the maximum hop length here, you can see that there’s a longer one that goes</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:07,440 –&gt; 00:09:16,960<br>like this. That’s probably about the longest. So that’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that will be another</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:16,960 –&gt; 00:09:24,639<br>hop for that information to propagate. So it’s the longest loop free path. We know that a path that</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:24,639 –&gt; 00:09:28,720<br>has a loop in it must have a higher cost. So we’re never going to pick that one. So so long as we’ve</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:28,720 –&gt; 00:09:33,519<br>gone as many hops as the longest loop free path, we know that we’ll finish. The question is how do</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:33,519 –&gt; 00:09:38,240<br>we know that we’ll end up with the right answer? In fact, there’s a couple of questions that are worth</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:38,240 –&gt; 00:09:43,279<br>asking here. The first one is what is the maximum runtime of the algorithm? Just told you that.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:43,279 –&gt; 00:09:47,920<br>It’s going to be the longest loop free path. It’s going to be the hop count of the longest loop free path.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:49,680 –&gt; 00:09:55,920<br>Will the algorithm always converge? Intuitive late is actually pretty clear that it must converge,</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:55,919 –&gt; 00:10:02,159<br>because we start out with the values infinity and we only ever replace them with lower values</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:02,159 –&gt; 00:10:08,479<br>and we keep reducing the value until the algorithm has run. So we only have a replace a value with a</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:08,479 –&gt; 00:10:14,799<br>lower cost value and eventually we should hear from all of our neighbors their lowest cost path.</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:15,679 –&gt; 00:10:20,319<br>And so eventually we will reach the lowest value and we will converge. So the algorithm will</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:20,320 –&gt; 00:10:26,879<br>always converge. It’s the clever thing about this algorithm. So what happens when link costs change</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:26,879 –&gt; 00:10:33,600<br>or when links and routers fail? We’ll see an example of that in a minute when actually things can go</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:33,600 –&gt; 00:10:39,440<br>wrong when that happens, but in general it will continue to converge because when something fails,</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:39,440 –&gt; 00:10:45,440<br>if a lower cost path should suddenly appear, then it will find it and start using it. Things are</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:45,440 –&gt; 00:10:51,200<br>a little bit more complicated when things fail and there is no longer a path to somewhere. And I’ll</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:51,200 –&gt; 00:10:56,640<br>see you show you an example of this in right now. This is a well-known problem with the Bellman</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:56,640 –&gt; 00:11:02,800<br>Ford algorithm and it’s sometimes characterized as bad news travels slowly. Let’s see what that’s</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:02,800 –&gt; 00:11:08,400<br>what’s going on here. We’re going to look at this really simple four router network here that are</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:08,400 –&gt; 00:11:14,320<br>all connected in a line and the cost from one router to the next is one. So nice simple trivial</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:14,320 –&gt; 00:11:19,920<br>example. So initially everything’s working fine. We’ve converged on these values down here at time</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:19,920 –&gt; 00:11:26,960<br>zero. We happen to know that we can get to R4. So this is all about the costs to reach R4 in this case.</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:28,240 –&gt; 00:11:35,440<br>We that R1 can get there in a cost of three. So that’s its value. If it goes via R2,</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:35,840 –&gt; 00:11:43,280<br>R2 can get there at a cost of two. That’s this plus this. If it goes via R3,</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:44,640 –&gt; 00:11:50,000<br>R3 can get there in a cost of one and it’s directly connected to R4. So everything is good.</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:50,880 –&gt; 00:11:57,440<br>But then suddenly the link from three to four is going to break. So this link over here has broken.</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:58,080 –&gt; 00:12:07,040<br>What happens next? Well, what’s going to happen is they’re going to keep advertising their cost.</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:07,520 –&gt; 00:12:14,240<br>R3 is going to start advertising. Hey, I was under the impression that I could get there with a cost</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:14,240 –&gt; 00:12:21,440<br>of one before. That’s here. But I don’t have that link anymore. I know that that link is broken.</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:21,520 –&gt; 00:12:29,360<br>But I did hear from R2 that R2 could get there at a cost of two. Now I am one hop away from R2.</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:29,360 –&gt; 00:12:34,000<br>So therefore I must be able to get there in a cost of three if I send my packets to R2.</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:34,640 –&gt; 00:12:40,000<br>Clearly this is wrong. R3 is delusional. Can’t really do that. But because it’s being hearing</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:40,000 –&gt; 00:12:46,080<br>this value advertised from R2 that says if you send packets to me, I’ll deliver them to R4 at a cost</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:46,080 –&gt; 00:12:53,200<br>of two plus the cost from me to you. And so therefore a cost of three. Our one doesn’t know anything</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:53,200 –&gt; 00:13:01,920<br>about the failure yet. Let’s see what happens in the next step. So the question is will it eventually</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:01,920 –&gt; 00:13:10,960<br>converge and settle down on the correct value? So in the next step, because R3 is now advertising</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:10,960 –&gt; 00:13:21,120<br>its cost as being three if it goes via R2, that news is going to reach R2. And R2 is going to say,</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:21,120 –&gt; 00:13:27,120<br>hey, you were previously saying to me that it was a cost of three, but you’re now, sorry, a cost</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:27,120 –&gt; 00:13:33,120<br>of one. Now you’re telling me it’s a cost of three. So therefore it must be costing me four to get</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:33,120 –&gt; 00:13:38,400<br>there. It’s your cost which was three that you were advertising to me plus the one. So it’s costing</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:38,720 –&gt; 00:13:44,639<br>me four to get there if I go via R3. And you can see what’s going to happen is this is going to</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:44,639 –&gt; 00:13:50,559<br>gradually, they’re going to gradually keep feeding each other bad information iteratively and it’s</p>
<p>128<br>00:13:50,559 –&gt; 00:13:55,840<br>going to increase at every step. And this is just going to spiral out of control. So in the next round,</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:57,519 –&gt; 00:14:03,759<br>R2 is going to say, hey, you’re telling me that I can get there at four plus the cost from me to you.</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:03,759 –&gt; 00:14:08,159<br>That’s five. If I send packets to you and so it goes to five and then you know it’s going to go to six</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:09,200 –&gt; 00:14:14,000<br>and so on and it’s just going to keep increasing as we go around. This is known as the counting to</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:14,000 –&gt; 00:14:22,319<br>infinity problem or bad news travel slowly. There’s a fairly simple fix to this which is, it seems a</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:22,319 –&gt; 00:14:27,679<br>bit of a, bit of a clue, but we could set into infinity to be some small number and say 16 and</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:27,679 –&gt; 00:14:31,679<br>stop when you get to a count of 16. If you get to a count of 16, it actually means that there’s no</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:31,679 –&gt; 00:14:37,359<br>path at all. There are various other methods. There’s one that’s called split horizon. You’ll find</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:37,359 –&gt; 00:14:43,439<br>this described in textbook. Essentially, because R2 received the lowest cost path from R3,</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:44,799 –&gt; 00:14:51,039<br>it does not advertise that cost to R3. In other words, because R2 was originally receiving that lowest</p>
<p>138<br>00:14:51,039 –&gt; 00:14:59,919<br>cost path from R3, it doesn’t send those advertisements to R3. And so R3 will never think that it can</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:59,919 –&gt; 00:15:06,959<br>reach R4 via R2. So that’s one way. Another one is called split horizon with poison reverse.</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:07,919 –&gt; 00:15:16,159<br>In this case, R2 will actively advertise infinity to R3. So it says, because I heard the lowest</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:16,159 –&gt; 00:15:22,399<br>cost path from you, I’m going to actively send you the value infinity. So you will absolutely never</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:22,399 –&gt; 00:15:29,679<br>think that you can get there via me. So these are kind of fixes to what is really an elegant algorithm,</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:29,679 –&gt; 00:15:34,479<br>but in practice, it takes quite a few things like this to make it work. Let’s take a look at</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:34,479 –&gt; 00:15:40,319<br>Belmanford in practice. Belmanford is an example of a distance vector algorithm. In other words,</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:40,319 –&gt; 00:15:46,399<br>there’s a distance vector that is maintained by all of the routers of the distance from them to</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:46,399 –&gt; 00:15:52,319<br>every other router. And then they iteratively converge on the correct answer. In other words,</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:52,319 –&gt; 00:15:57,599<br>the correct minimum cost distance. This is an example of, therefore, of a distance vector algorithm</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:57,600 –&gt; 00:16:03,279<br>and formed the heart of one of the first routing protocols used in the internet, called RIP.</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:03,759 –&gt; 00:16:08,720<br>And the RIP stood for the routing information protocol. And it was used very widely for a</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:08,720 –&gt; 00:16:13,200<br>quite a long time. And this was because it requires very little computation on the routers. It could</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:13,200 –&gt; 00:16:17,759<br>be calculated in a distributed way, requiring very little burden, computational burden on each</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:17,759 –&gt; 00:16:22,399<br>of the routers. And we knew that it would eventually converge with a few little fixes here like</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:22,959 –&gt; 00:16:28,159<br>the split horizon technique and preventing it from counting to infinity. Over time, though, it was</p>
<p>154<br>00:16:28,159 –&gt; 00:16:33,600<br>replaced by other algorithms, other techniques that collect together the entire state of the network</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:33,600 –&gt; 00:16:39,600<br>on each router. And then independently, on their own, calculate the minimum cost spanning tree.</p>
<p>156<br>00:16:39,600 –&gt; 00:16:45,199<br>So no longer a distributed algorithm. We’ll see an example of that in another video on Dijkstra’s</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:45,200 –&gt; 00:16:46,800<br>shortest path first algorithm.</p>
