<p>2<br>00:00:05,520 –&gt; 00:00:10,439<br>routing, distance vector and link state algorithms and how routing works in the</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,439 –&gt; 00:00:14,519<br>internet, the structure of the internet, autonomous systems, the hierarchy of</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,519 –&gt; 00:00:19,640<br>those autonomous systems, exterior routing protocols, interior routing protocols.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,640 –&gt; 00:00:24,320<br>So in this video I’m going to tell you about the specific exterior routing</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:24,320 –&gt; 00:00:28,560<br>protocol that all autonomous systems must use when connecting to their</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,559 –&gt; 00:00:32,920<br>neighbors. That’s BGP or the Board of Gateway Protocol currently in version</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:32,920 –&gt; 00:00:42,320<br>4. Okay let’s start with the basics of BGP 4. BGP is not a link state or a</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:42,320 –&gt; 00:00:47,239<br>distance vector routing protocol. Instead it’s used, it uses what’s called a path</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:47,239 –&gt; 00:00:53,920<br>vector and the way this works is that the BGP routers at the boundary of each</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:53,920 –&gt; 00:00:59,440<br>autonomous system will advertise a complete path and that path has a list of</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,440 –&gt; 00:01:04,480<br>ASs that you pass through in order to reach a particular destination prefix.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:04,480 –&gt; 00:01:10,000<br>This is also called the AS path and that’s the path vector. So an example of a</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:10,000 –&gt; 00:01:17,320<br>path advertisement might look like this. It says the network prefix 171.64-16</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:17,320 –&gt; 00:01:23,640<br>can be reached via the path going through these three at ASs, 15 and 13. So that</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:23,640 –&gt; 00:01:29,840<br>might be an example of an advertisement that the BGP might advertise to one of</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:29,840 –&gt; 00:01:36,599<br>its neighbors. The consequence of sending out a path is that paths with loops are</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:36,599 –&gt; 00:01:41,760<br>very easily detected locally. You just look for repetition of an AS and then you</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:41,760 –&gt; 00:01:48,120<br>can simply remove those or just completely ignore those advertisements and that</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:48,120 –&gt; 00:01:53,120<br>makes it very easy to find and eliminate loops. But perhaps the most important</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:53,120 –&gt; 00:02:00,079<br>feature of BGP is that local policies that a private and secret to a</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:00,079 –&gt; 00:02:05,200<br>particular autonomous system can pick the preferred path among those that are</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:05,200 –&gt; 00:02:09,240<br>advertised to it. So if a number of neighboring autonomous systems advertise</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:09,240 –&gt; 00:02:14,560<br>different paths to reach the same prefix, then the local policy can pick whichever</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:14,560 –&gt; 00:02:19,040<br>one it chooses, whichever one it wants. It’s not accountable to anyone else when</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:19,039 –&gt; 00:02:24,919<br>it’s picking that. Finally when a link or a router fails the path is withdrawn</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:24,919 –&gt; 00:02:31,079<br>just like an advertisement comes with just like the one above a withdrawal</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:31,079 –&gt; 00:02:35,099<br>would look very similar in which it would say this particular prefix can no</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:35,099 –&gt; 00:02:42,719<br>longer be reached via this path. So BGP4 starts with a relationship between</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:42,719 –&gt; 00:02:50,719<br>customers and providers. Let’s take a look at this. So let’s start with</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:50,719 –&gt; 00:02:58,479<br>during a particular AS this would be the provider AS, the one that’s the one</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:58,479 –&gt; 00:03:07,240<br>sitting above in the hierarchy and then the customer AS sitting below. The</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:07,240 –&gt; 00:03:13,800<br>relationship between them is although traffic can flow to or from the customer</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:13,800 –&gt; 00:03:20,159<br>through the provider in either direction and may go off through multiple exit</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:20,159 –&gt; 00:03:25,200<br>points because of this specific relationship between them and that relationship</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:25,200 –&gt; 00:03:35,960<br>is one of two customer. It has specific implications and one of them is that the</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:35,960 –&gt; 00:03:40,879<br>customer will always pay the provider to carry its packets. So if we’re thinking</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:40,879 –&gt; 00:03:47,560<br>of how money flows money is flowing up in this direction here the customer is</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:47,560 –&gt; 00:03:54,400<br>paying the provider in order to carry its packets. So this hierarchy of customers</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:54,400 –&gt; 00:04:00,600<br>to providers continues. So if we have multiple ASs so let’s draw some ASs here</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:00,599 –&gt; 00:04:07,759<br>and some down here these could be the access ASs that we saw before then this</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:07,759 –&gt; 00:04:15,519<br>relationship between them of provider towards customer could go like this. And what</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:15,519 –&gt; 00:04:23,680<br>that tells us is that the as before the money is actually flowing in the other</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:23,680 –&gt; 00:04:31,959<br>direction for settlement charges between them and IP traffic can go in the</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:31,959 –&gt; 00:04:40,480<br>following in the following way. So IP traffic could flow from a customer up to</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:40,480 –&gt; 00:04:46,040<br>its provider, up to its provider down through its customer and down through its</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:46,040 –&gt; 00:04:53,079<br>customer down here. Similarly a something from here traffic from here could flow</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:53,079 –&gt; 00:04:58,439<br>through this way. If there was another there was another relationship for example</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:58,439 –&gt; 00:05:06,159<br>this particular one access AS down here had relationships with providers</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:06,159 –&gt; 00:05:15,079<br>above it in two places. Traffic is a land to flow through any of these any of</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:15,079 –&gt; 00:05:21,519<br>these paths so it could flow down this way or down this way. In general they will</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:21,519 –&gt; 00:05:28,399<br>not flow through an intermediate at the same level and we’ll see an example of</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:28,399 –&gt; 00:05:35,000<br>that of that a little bit later. So this the reason for telling about this</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:35,000 –&gt; 00:05:38,279<br>customer provider hierarchy is we’re going to see it show up a little bit later</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:38,279 –&gt; 00:05:45,479<br>in the policies that BGP uses. And basically the peering relationship is as</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:45,480 –&gt; 00:05:51,360<br>follows. So looking at this example here where we have just as before we have</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:51,360 –&gt; 00:05:57,920<br>three ASs here here and here which are the providers and then three down here</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:57,920 –&gt; 00:06:01,920<br>that are the customers of those and the key here is telling us what the</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:01,920 –&gt; 00:06:07,319<br>provider customer relationship and that these ones appear are peers of each</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:07,319 –&gt; 00:06:15,439<br>other. So in general a peer cannot be a transit for its other peers</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:15,439 –&gt; 00:06:20,560<br>in other words this particular path that’s shown here the black dotted line is</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:20,560 –&gt; 00:06:27,079<br>not loud because it’s going through this one this this peer. That’s because</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:27,079 –&gt; 00:06:32,360<br>typically the relationship here between two peers is settlement free there’s no</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:32,360 –&gt; 00:06:39,600<br>dollars flowing across here. So peers do not provide transit between peers. Now</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:39,600 –&gt; 00:06:42,720<br>let’s take a look at BGP messages and then we’ll look at the policies that</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:42,720 –&gt; 00:06:47,320<br>BGP implements. So there are basically four types of BGP message. There’s an</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:47,320 –&gt; 00:06:51,840<br>open message to establish a BGP session. There’s a keep alive in order to</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:51,840 –&gt; 00:06:56,920<br>provide a handshake at regular intervals. That’s just basically an occasional</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:56,920 –&gt; 00:07:01,400<br>message just to be able to check that the BGP session is still alive between</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:01,400 –&gt; 00:07:05,640<br>two routers that are connected to each other and there’s a notification to</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:05,640 –&gt; 00:07:09,920<br>shut down a peering session. So these three here open keep alive and</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:09,920 –&gt; 00:07:14,720<br>notification are basically the ones that keep the session alive. The ones that</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:14,720 –&gt; 00:07:19,439<br>actually announce and then withdraw routes are the update messages and these are</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:19,439 –&gt; 00:07:24,439<br>the the most important ones. They announce new routes or they withdraw ones that</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:24,439 –&gt; 00:07:30,720<br>were previously announced and these are the the we saw an example of that</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:30,720 –&gt; 00:07:36,800<br>earlier with the advertisement of the particular path for a prefix. An</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:36,800 –&gt; 00:07:44,480<br>announcement basically consists of the prefix and then the path attributes. So it’ll</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:44,480 –&gt; 00:07:50,560<br>be the path of ASS and then attributes associated with it and we’ll see an</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:50,560 –&gt; 00:07:57,800<br>example of that now. So the path attributes are the next top information where</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:57,800 –&gt; 00:08:01,360<br>you go in order to be able to use this. In other words who it is that’s</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:01,360 –&gt; 00:08:07,960<br>advertising this this particular path to us. The particular AS path so that’s</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:07,960 –&gt; 00:08:12,520<br>the sequence of ASS that you would go through and then various other things the</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:12,520 –&gt; 00:08:16,280<br>local preference and the multi-exit discriminator and there are various</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:16,280 –&gt; 00:08:21,160<br>other parameters that are passed as well that tell us information that would</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:21,160 –&gt; 00:08:28,240<br>allow us to pick the the particular path when we receive multiple</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:28,240 –&gt; 00:08:32,840<br>advertisements from different peers. So these are used to select amongst multiple</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:32,840 –&gt; 00:08:37,759<br>options for paths because we may hear from multiple peers on how to reach a</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:37,759 –&gt; 00:08:43,680<br>particular destination prefix and basically when we have a choice the the</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:43,680 –&gt; 00:08:50,639<br>sequence goes something like this. So we start with the the highest local</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:50,639 –&gt; 00:08:56,200<br>preference. This is the highest local preference. We’ll see an example of that</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:56,200 –&gt; 00:09:01,480<br>in a moment. It’s a local preference that tells us how we enforce relationships</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:01,480 –&gt; 00:09:05,480<br>we might prefer customer routes over peer routes and we’ll see an example of</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:05,480 –&gt; 00:09:11,320<br>that in a moment. If the local preference which is essentially our local policy</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:11,320 –&gt; 00:09:15,960<br>if that doesn’t tell us which particular path to pick when we have some choice</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:15,960 –&gt; 00:09:20,120<br>the next one is we’ll simply pick the shortest autonomous system path.</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:20,120 –&gt; 00:09:24,280<br>Knows the shortest path to a destination and then there are various other</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:24,279 –&gt; 00:09:27,759<br>parameters that we might pick that are all to do with helping us do good traffic</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:27,759 –&gt; 00:09:32,519<br>engineering. What this means is that we will tend to send traffic over</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:32,519 –&gt; 00:09:38,079<br>over lightly loaded paths and will cause less congestion in the network. But the</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:38,079 –&gt; 00:09:41,240<br>ones that we most are most interested interested in are the highest local</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:41,240 –&gt; 00:09:46,559<br>preference and the shortest day as path. If all of these fail to distinguish or</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:46,559 –&gt; 00:09:50,399<br>identify a particular path that we should choose then we simply go with the</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:50,399 –&gt; 00:09:54,439<br>lowest router ID. In other words that’s the lowest router ID of one of our</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:54,439 –&gt; 00:09:58,319<br>neighbors and that’s essentially throwing up our hands in a means of breaking</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:58,319 –&gt; 00:10:04,720<br>ties if there’s no other way to pick between advertised routes. Let’s take a</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:04,720 –&gt; 00:10:10,919<br>look at how the autonomous system path the AS path attribute might work. So we’re</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:10,919 –&gt; 00:10:18,120<br>looking at an example of how we might pick the shortest path. So let’s say that</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:18,120 –&gt; 00:10:24,200<br>we are sitting over here at this particular autonomous system here and we’re</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:24,200 –&gt; 00:10:31,279<br>hearing about a prefix that originated down here. Here’s the prefix 135.207.0.0</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:31,279 –&gt; 00:10:38,840<br>slash 16 and it originated from here and so it will initially be</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:38,840 –&gt; 00:10:43,480<br>advertised up here and then it’ll be advertised up here and when it gets</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:43,480 –&gt; 00:10:54,440<br>advertised here it will say you can reach this particular prefix 135.207.0.0 slash</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:54,440 –&gt; 00:11:05,759<br>16. You can reach it via AS7018 followed by 6341 and then that will flow around</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:05,759 –&gt; 00:11:10,639<br>here and then they added one AS to the path then so get advertised here. So by</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:10,639 –&gt; 00:11:19,519<br>the time it comes down here we will find out that the prefix 135.207.0 slash 16</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:19,519 –&gt; 00:11:33,000<br>can be reached through 1129, 1755 and so on until we get to 7018 and likewise</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:33,000 –&gt; 00:11:37,879<br>there’ll be an advertisement that will come around this path that will say hey</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:37,879 –&gt; 00:11:48,559<br>I can get you to 135.207 slash 16 through the sequence 70183549 so it’s</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:48,559 –&gt; 00:11:54,720<br>over a much shorter path. So in this particular case if I haven’t got a higher</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:54,720 –&gt; 00:12:01,279<br>local preference then the router will say this is the shorter path and so I will</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:01,279 –&gt; 00:12:06,679<br>pick as my favorite to send packets this way in order to reach this</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:06,679 –&gt; 00:12:11,759<br>particular prefix and so we’ll install that decision locally in its routers that</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:11,759 –&gt; 00:12:15,719<br>says when I see this packet with this prefix then I’m going to send it out</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:15,719 –&gt; 00:12:21,719<br>this direction and that’s my choice. There could be many many choices so let’s</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:21,719 –&gt; 00:12:26,639<br>look at an example here. So in this particular network Frank’s internet bar</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:26,639 –&gt; 00:12:32,639<br>is trying to decide which route it should pick in order to reach this</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:32,639 –&gt; 00:12:40,039<br>prefix 13.13 slash 16 which is down here in AS1. The nature of the relationship</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:40,039 –&gt; 00:12:46,879<br>here is that Frank is connected directly to a provider AS4 it’s connected to a</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:46,879 –&gt; 00:12:53,080<br>peer AS3 and it’s connected to a customer AS2 which in turn is connected to</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:53,080 –&gt; 00:12:58,360<br>another customer down here. So we could have a number of different local</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:58,360 –&gt; 00:13:09,240<br>preferences and it might say I’m going to give a local preference of let’s say</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:09,240 –&gt; 00:13:15,840<br>100 to my peer to customer, my provided a customer relationship. In other</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:15,840 –&gt; 00:13:22,000<br>words I’m going to give preference of 100 to routes that are advertised by my</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:22,000 –&gt; 00:13:29,919<br>customers to me and maybe I just say I’ll give a local preference of 80 to</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:29,919 –&gt; 00:13:36,240<br>ones that are received from my provider and 90 to ones that are received from my</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:36,240 –&gt; 00:13:43,600<br>peer. What that basically says is if I hear a route that is arrives from my</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:43,600 –&gt; 00:13:47,559<br>customer I’m going to take that very seriously because that’s a paying</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:47,559 –&gt; 00:13:52,359<br>relationship and I would prefer to send it to my customer rather than sending it</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:52,359 –&gt; 00:13:56,919<br>over to a provider where I’m going to have to pay. So I’m going to give preference</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:56,919 –&gt; 00:14:02,959<br>from if they’re coming up through the from from the customer. My second favorite</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:02,959 –&gt; 00:14:06,159<br>choice is from a peer because I don’t pay there either because it’s presumably</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:06,159 –&gt; 00:14:09,759<br>settlement free but where I actually have to pay for the traffic is to the</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:09,759 –&gt; 00:14:14,679<br>provider. So if I hear a route that’s advertised down here I’m going to not</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:14,679 –&gt; 00:14:19,399<br>likely to pick that and this that’s my only that’s my only choice. So basically</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:19,399 –&gt; 00:14:26,599<br>I’m saying in terms of my choice customer customer advertised routes are</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:26,599 –&gt; 00:14:31,679<br>more better than peer advertised routes are better than provider advertised</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:31,679 –&gt; 00:14:37,959<br>routes. And this is a pretty common for it’s it’s not baked into BGP you can</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:37,959 –&gt; 00:14:41,199<br>just set the preference values to do this you could also set the preference</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:41,200 –&gt; 00:14:45,520<br>values to be the opposite although that would be pretty unlikely. So when these</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:45,520 –&gt; 00:14:51,800<br>these advertisements are going to arrive for this particular AS they’re going to</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:51,800 –&gt; 00:14:55,920<br>come up through here to Frank they’re going to come up through here to Frank</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:55,920 –&gt; 00:14:59,759<br>and they’re going to come this way to Frank. Frank is going to pick the one that</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:59,759 –&gt; 00:15:03,520<br>goes down through the customer so when he sends traffic he’s going to send</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:03,520 –&gt; 00:15:09,160<br>traffic down this way to AS1 because that’s his favorite path because that’s the</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:09,159 –&gt; 00:15:14,120<br>one with the lowest local preference. So local preference is the one that I</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:14,120 –&gt; 00:15:19,019<br>use first and if that doesn’t tell me my my choice then I’ll pick the shortest</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:19,019 –&gt; 00:15:26,860<br>AS path and then I’ll walk down that list that was on the previous slide. So in</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:26,860 –&gt; 00:15:32,759<br>summary all autonomous systems in the internet must connect using BGP4. That’s</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:32,759 –&gt; 00:15:36,759<br>the exterior protocol that they must use to talk to their peers or to their</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:36,759 –&gt; 00:15:41,559<br>neighbors the routers are the neighboring autonomous system. BGP4 is a path</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:41,559 –&gt; 00:15:47,240<br>vector algorithm that means a list of the autonomous systems is sent along with</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:47,240 –&gt; 00:15:52,480<br>every advertised prefix and this allows loops to be detected very easily and for</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:52,480 –&gt; 00:15:57,559<br>a router to examine that path and choose whether it wants to use it or not</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:57,559 –&gt; 00:16:04,120<br>depending on its policies. BGP4 has a rich and complex interface to let</p>
<p>165<br>00:16:04,120 –&gt; 00:16:08,519<br>autonomous systems choose a local private policy based on all sorts of</p>
<p>166<br>00:16:08,519 –&gt; 00:16:12,200<br>things you could you could spend a whole quarter learning about nothing else</p>
<p>167<br>00:16:12,200 –&gt; 00:16:16,519<br>than how BGP works and what the consequences are there being many many papers are</p>
<p>168<br>00:16:16,519 –&gt; 00:16:22,879<br>written on the on the consequences of these policies. So EJS decides a local</p>
<p>169<br>00:16:22,879 –&gt; 00:16:27,240<br>policy for traffic engineering security and any other private preferences that</p>
<p>170<br>00:16:27,240 –&gt; 00:16:31,639<br>might have so that it can choose amongst advertised paths coming from</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:31,639 –&gt; 00:16:38,240<br>different neighboring autonomous systems. That’s the end of this video about BGP.</p>
