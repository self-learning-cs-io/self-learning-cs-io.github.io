                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,400<br>When we connect our computer to the network today, we’re usually using Wi-Fi for wireless</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,400 –&gt; 00:00:12,679<br>or Ethernet for a wired connection. Ethernet is by far the most widely used link layer mechanism</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:12,679 –&gt; 00:00:18,519<br>in the internet today. So the link layer covers how an end host is connected to a router, how</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,519 –&gt; 00:00:23,960<br>one router is connected to the next, and generally as we’ve seen, packets at the IP layer are</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,960 –&gt; 00:00:29,120<br>encapsulated into a link layer frame most often Ethernet in order to be sent off to the</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,120 –&gt; 00:00:34,399<br>first router. So in this video and the next I’m going to be describing something called</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:34,399 –&gt; 00:00:41,480<br>CSMACD, which is right at the heart of how Ethernet works and was very much a part of the</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:41,480 –&gt; 00:00:46,480<br>original Ethernet. And I’ll be describing how Ethernet started out, its evolution over</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,480 –&gt; 00:00:52,000<br>the years, and then how Ethernet switching became a very common way to extend the scope</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:52,000 –&gt; 00:00:59,880<br>of a link to cover many many end hosts connected to a single router. You’ll often hear</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:59,880 –&gt; 00:01:05,159<br>Ethernet referred to as layer 2, and this goes back to the 7 layer OSI model that we saw</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:05,159 –&gt; 00:01:11,280<br>in an earlier video. Whereas in the 4 layer internet model, Ethernet is the lowest layer.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:11,280 –&gt; 00:01:16,159<br>In the 7 layer OSI model, Ethernet encompassed both the link and the physical layers, both</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:16,159 –&gt; 00:01:21,480<br>of the lower 2. So Ethernet is often referred to as layer 2 because of the link. The link</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:21,480 –&gt; 00:01:26,640<br>really just covers the frame format and the algorithm that decides when a packet can be sent</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:26,640 –&gt; 00:01:32,040<br>onto the wire. And we’re going to see that a little bit later, that’s the CSMACD mechanism.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:32,040 –&gt; 00:01:36,120<br>The physical layer covers things like the connectors and the electrical signals that are used</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:36,120 –&gt; 00:01:41,880<br>on the wire. Ethernet started out as a means to connect multiple computers together on a</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:41,880 –&gt; 00:01:49,600<br>single cable. That single cable was arranged as a long string or a bus as shown here. It</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:49,599 –&gt; 00:01:54,359<br>was in fact a big thick yellow cable that snaked around either in the walls, the ceiling,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:54,359 –&gt; 00:01:59,239<br>or under the floor. And computers would be connected down into it. And then they’re all</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:59,239 –&gt; 00:02:05,319<br>sharing access to this same common wire. And the idea was that they would share it in order</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:05,319 –&gt; 00:02:11,560<br>to be able to send packets between themselves. But there only one packet would be allowed</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:11,560 –&gt; 00:02:16,319<br>onto the cable at a time because otherwise it would collide or corrupt and interfere with</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:16,319 –&gt; 00:02:23,239<br>other packets. So this is what we call sharing a medium. And Ethernet is an example of when</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:23,239 –&gt; 00:02:30,639<br>multiple hosts share a common cable. That’s what we mean by medium. So to share the medium,</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:30,639 –&gt; 00:02:36,039<br>we need to decide who gets to send and when. Because if only one packet can be sent on</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:36,039 –&gt; 00:02:40,879<br>the medium at a time, we need to decide when the medium becomes free. Who is it that gets</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:40,879 –&gt; 00:02:45,560<br>to use it next? Do they do it in round robin order? Do they do it randomly? Whoever gets</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:45,560 –&gt; 00:02:50,039<br>to send first, what is the mechanism for doing so? And there’s generally a class of what</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:50,039 –&gt; 00:02:56,400<br>are called medium access control protocols or Mac protocols. And these are the protocols</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:56,400 –&gt; 00:03:01,560<br>or algorithms for determining who gets to send next. We’re going to look at some examples.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:01,560 –&gt; 00:03:05,960<br>But one thing to note here is you’ve probably heard Ethernet addresses being referred to</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:05,960 –&gt; 00:03:11,240<br>as Mac addresses before. And you may even see this written on the bottom of your computer.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:11,240 –&gt; 00:03:16,040<br>Mac stands for medium access control. Even though we’ll see later Ethernet doesn’t use this</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:16,040 –&gt; 00:03:22,000<br>mechanism very much anymore. That’s just a vestige of the earlier 10 megabit per second</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:22,000 –&gt; 00:03:28,040<br>version of Ethernet. Let’s take a look at some examples of medium access control protocols.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:28,040 –&gt; 00:03:32,200<br>There actually been dozens or hundreds of them described, published, and invented over</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:32,200 –&gt; 00:03:36,800<br>the years. And many of them were standardized. But because many of them have gone out of</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:36,800 –&gt; 00:03:42,400<br>fashion, I’m really going to be focusing on just one Ethernet or carry a sense multiple</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:42,400 –&gt; 00:03:47,680<br>access with collision detection, CSMACD. That’s the one we’re going to be focusing on.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:47,680 –&gt; 00:03:52,840<br>But I just want to set it into context a little bit. So there are Mac protocols which are simple</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:52,840 –&gt; 00:04:00,040<br>and random, the simplest of which is something called a loha that I will describe in a moment.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:00,040 –&gt; 00:04:04,360<br>And at the other extreme is a method called token passing. Let me describe roughly how</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:04,360 –&gt; 00:04:09,720<br>these work. Let me start with a simple and random mechanisms. A random access protocol is</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:09,720 –&gt; 00:04:16,160<br>one where every host can try to send at any time that it has data to send. It doesn’t need to</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:16,160 –&gt; 00:04:22,600<br>wait for some central authority to give it permission or until its turn comes around. It just tries</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:22,600 –&gt; 00:04:27,639<br>to send. It might listen and see whether anyone else is speaking or it just may go right ahead.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:27,639 –&gt; 00:04:33,960<br>So it’s random in the sense that it just may start speaking at any time. The other extreme</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:34,839 –&gt; 00:04:41,879<br>deterministic protocols like token passing have some means to explicitly control who gets to</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:41,879 –&gt; 00:04:47,879<br>go next. In other words, which host gets to send a packet next? The most common method is called</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:47,879 –&gt; 00:04:55,159<br>token passing in which a special packet or a token is sent from one host to the next. So they might</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:55,159 –&gt; 00:05:03,719<br>be arranged for example in a ring and there will be a packet called a token that goes around. This</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:03,720 –&gt; 00:05:08,520<br>would be the token packet. And when you hold the token, you’re allowed to send a packet. So it</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:08,520 –&gt; 00:05:14,440<br>might then send a packet onto another host. So this would be the packet being sent. And then when</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:14,440 –&gt; 00:05:19,320<br>it’s finished sending the packet, it then passes on the token to its neighbor who then gets the</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:19,320 –&gt; 00:05:24,760<br>opportunity to send a packet and then we’ll send the token on again. So the token will go around</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:24,760 –&gt; 00:05:30,440<br>like the conch shell in Lord of the Flies if you’ve read that book or in any mechanism where we have</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:30,439 –&gt; 00:05:35,959<br>a round robin opportunity to send. And the token is indicating who gets to send next.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:37,879 –&gt; 00:05:44,120<br>This gives every host the chance to send in a deterministic order. But it does require us to</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:44,120 –&gt; 00:05:48,759<br>both generate and maintain this token. And it turns out that there are lots of ways in which this</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:48,759 –&gt; 00:05:55,159<br>mechanism can fail. And the token get lost or the token can get duplicated. And so these have</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:55,160 –&gt; 00:06:02,040<br>generally fallen out of favor of being replaced by the simpler Ethernet mechanism in which every</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:02,040 –&gt; 00:06:07,960<br>host just basically randomly sends. But we’ll see how that’s controlled using this CSMA CD mechanism</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:07,960 –&gt; 00:06:13,640<br>in a moment. So generally speaking, random access protocols are simple and to implement,</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:14,600 –&gt; 00:06:19,400<br>give really good performance when there are a small number of senders sending data at random times.</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:19,400 –&gt; 00:06:23,640<br>But they work less well under very heavy load because they can spend a lot of time colliding with</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:23,639 –&gt; 00:06:26,839<br>each other and corrupting each other until they figure out an opportunity to send.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:31,079 –&gt; 00:06:37,399<br>So when we’re designing a Mac protocol or choosing one, then we generally have some goals in mind.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:37,399 –&gt; 00:06:42,199<br>We would like to have high utilization of the shared channel. We’d like to make sure that most</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:42,199 –&gt; 00:06:48,919<br>of the time is spent sending data not trying to recover from collisions or when multiple end hosts</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:48,920 –&gt; 00:06:55,319<br>are talking at the same time. We’d like it to be fair. We’d like it to be fair in the sense that</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:55,319 –&gt; 00:07:01,800<br>everybody gets an equal opportunity to send averaged over a long period. We’d like it to be simple</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:01,800 –&gt; 00:07:08,280<br>and low cost to implement so that it can be very widely deployed. And we’d like it to be robust</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:08,280 –&gt; 00:07:13,639<br>to errors. So we’d like it that if an end host fails, then the chances are it’s not going to bring</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:13,639 –&gt; 00:07:22,519<br>the whole network down. Let me start with an example. And the example that I’m going to be using is</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:23,959 –&gt; 00:07:30,039<br>one of the earliest media maxes control protocols called the aloha protocol that was used in the aloha</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:30,039 –&gt; 00:07:36,279<br>network in Hawaii. So here are the Hawaiian Islands. Basically, there was a central station in</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:36,279 –&gt; 00:07:45,000<br>Oahu, where Honolulu is. And then there were relays or end attachments at radio transmitters</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:45,000 –&gt; 00:07:51,879<br>on the islands of Kauai, Molokai, Maui and Hawaii. And every packet that was sent would be sent from</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:51,879 –&gt; 00:07:59,639<br>an end host into the central station, which would then re-broadcast it out to everybody. And so this</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:59,639 –&gt; 00:08:04,279<br>was radio based, RF based. There was no wire. And so the medium in this case was the air.</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:04,599 –&gt; 00:08:12,039<br>The way that aloha worked was all hosts would transmit on one frequency. So if a host has something</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:12,039 –&gt; 00:08:17,799<br>to send, it would send on say frequency zero. This blue is just representing the channel corresponding</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:17,799 –&gt; 00:08:24,039<br>to frequency zero. This would be sent up to the main relay station or the central relay station</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:24,039 –&gt; 00:08:31,079<br>in Oahu. And then that would be re-transmitted. The packet data would be re-transmitted out over</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:31,079 –&gt; 00:08:36,679<br>frequency one, a separate frequency. So essentially, a separate orthogonal channel that would then be</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:36,679 –&gt; 00:08:43,319<br>repeated to all end hosts. So we need a way to decide who can send when. And for this, we need a</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:43,319 –&gt; 00:08:49,720<br>protocol that everybody agrees upon so that the system will work correctly. And the first aloha</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:49,720 –&gt; 00:08:55,639<br>network to use the aloha Mac protocol, which is very simple. If you have data’s as sent, transmit it.</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:56,360 –&gt; 00:09:03,319<br>If your transmission collides with another, retry later. That was it. So very simple. You send.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:03,960 –&gt; 00:09:08,360<br>And then if you discover that it collided, then you would retry later. How do you know that it collided?</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:08,360 –&gt; 00:09:14,439<br>Well, you would send on frequency zero. And you would listen on frequency one. And if what came</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:14,439 –&gt; 00:09:21,319<br>back was not a correct copy of what you would send on frequency zero, you know it must have collided.</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:21,320 –&gt; 00:09:25,480<br>And therefore you need to send again. And you would retry at a later time.</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:27,000 –&gt; 00:09:33,640<br>Nice thing about the aloha protocol was very simple. It’s pretty robust against the failure of</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:33,640 –&gt; 00:09:38,440<br>an end host. What do I mean by this? Well, if an end host fails and just stops sending,</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:38,440 –&gt; 00:09:43,480<br>then the mechanism doesn’t rely on any end host being powered on or correctly operating,</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:43,480 –&gt; 00:09:48,760<br>because it’ll just stop sending packets. There is a failure condition if it just starts jabbering</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:48,759 –&gt; 00:09:54,120<br>away sending packets that are meaningless. It can actually bring down communication for everyone</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:54,120 –&gt; 00:10:00,120<br>else. So that’s why we say that it’s quite robust against failure. The protocol is distributed.</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:00,120 –&gt; 00:10:07,080<br>It’s distributed in the sense that it’s actually operating independently on all of the end hosts.</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:07,080 –&gt; 00:10:13,319<br>They all independently decide for themselves. Under low load, when there are very few,</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:13,319 –&gt; 00:10:18,519<br>either very few hosts sending or they’re sending at a very low rate, they’re sending infrequently,</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:18,519 –&gt; 00:10:24,199<br>we can expect the delay to be small. Nearly any host that has data to send will find that the</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:24,199 –&gt; 00:10:29,720<br>the channel is free when it wants to send its packet. So it’s very likely to get through first time.</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:29,720 –&gt; 00:10:34,039<br>We’re very little troubled. It doesn’t have to wait for some coordinating mechanism. It just sends</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:34,039 –&gt; 00:10:41,159<br>discovers that it gets through and that’s great. Under high load, a lot of time can be wasted sending</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:41,159 –&gt; 00:10:45,639<br>packets that collide, because under high load the chances are that there are other hosts wanting to</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:45,639 –&gt; 00:10:52,120<br>send at the same time. And so as a consequence, generally speaking, the Aloha protocol is</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:52,120 –&gt; 00:10:58,039<br>thought to have very low performance. And in fact, studies and theory and simulations have all</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:58,039 –&gt; 00:11:04,039<br>suggested that under high load, you can show that the wasted time is so high, we can only achieve</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:04,039 –&gt; 00:11:11,159<br>about 20% throughput, 18% in fact. So over 80% of the time is spent on transmissions that collide</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:11,240 –&gt; 00:11:17,399<br>under very heavy load. Clearly we need to improve performance. There were many, many papers in the</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:17,399 –&gt; 00:11:23,799<br>1970s and 80s on this topic of how to improve networks like this. And the technique most widely</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:23,799 –&gt; 00:11:30,759<br>adopted for wired networks is called CSMACD and it was used for Ethernet. And you can see some of</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:30,759 –&gt; 00:11:36,839<br>the ideas here for improving performance. One is instead of just going ahead and sending,</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:36,840 –&gt; 00:11:41,080<br>regardless of whether or anyone else is sending, you could actually listen for activity first.</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:41,080 –&gt; 00:11:47,080<br>This is the carrier sense part of CSMACD. So you listen first of all to check whether anyone</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:47,080 –&gt; 00:11:52,680<br>else is sending before sending a packet. If they are, you wait, if they’re not, then probably your</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:52,680 –&gt; 00:11:58,519<br>packet will get through okay. The next one is to try and detect collisions quickly and stop</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:58,519 –&gt; 00:12:03,480<br>transmitting. If you take your time to detect the collision or you wait until the packet is over,</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:03,480 –&gt; 00:12:09,080<br>then you’ve wasted all of that time. If you can detect it very, very quickly back off and then try</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:09,080 –&gt; 00:12:15,240<br>again later, then you can improve the performance. And the third one is after there has been a collision,</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:15,240 –&gt; 00:12:21,320<br>pick a random waiting time that is based on the load. In other words, pick a random time before</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:21,320 –&gt; 00:12:26,759<br>trying again. If the load is high, then wait a long time because that’ll give others the opportunity</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:26,759 –&gt; 00:12:31,800<br>to be able to send. If the load is low, then wait a short time because probably you’ll get through</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:31,799 –&gt; 00:12:37,479<br>successfully next time. If the load is high and you wait a short time, the chances are you’ll collide</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:37,479 –&gt; 00:12:44,279<br>again and it’ll just be a wasted opportunity. This leads us then naturally from that simple</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:44,279 –&gt; 00:12:52,279<br>Aloha mechanism to the very widely used CSMACD protocol. And this is how it works. So this is what</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:52,279 –&gt; 00:12:58,759<br>was used for the original 10 megabit per second ethernet. So all hosts can transmit and receive</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:58,840 –&gt; 00:13:06,200<br>on the one channel, which is this wire here. This is the shared medium. Packets are a variable size,</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:06,200 –&gt; 00:13:13,319<br>of course. When a host has a packet to transmit, first of all it does carry a sense. So that’s the CS of</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:13,319 –&gt; 00:13:21,159<br>CSMACD. It checks that the line is quiet before transmitting. So it listens. If the wire is quiet,</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:21,159 –&gt; 00:13:27,879<br>then it says probably my packet will get through. Then if there is a collision, it will try and detect it</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:27,879 –&gt; 00:13:34,600<br>quickly. It will detect the collision as soon as possible. If a collision is detected, it will stop</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:34,600 –&gt; 00:13:40,919<br>transmitting. Wait a random time and it’ll go back to one again. In other words, it will go back,</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:40,919 –&gt; 00:13:45,559<br>listen for whether the wire is quiet and then try and transmit. And if there’s a collision,</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:45,559 –&gt; 00:13:50,360<br>it will keep doing that. And it’ll just keep doing that until it’s successful. This random time is</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:50,360 –&gt; 00:13:55,960<br>called a binary exponential back off. And all it means is as the number of collisions</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:57,560 –&gt; 00:14:03,399<br>increase for a given packet, it will wait a longer time. In other words, if there are lots of</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:03,399 –&gt; 00:14:09,000<br>collisions, it means there’s lots of other transmitters. And therefore, I should try and hold off a</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:09,000 –&gt; 00:14:13,720<br>longer amount of time in order to be able to give everybody the opportunity to send.</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:14,680 –&gt; 00:14:24,360<br>Let’s look at how CSMACD works in practice. Let’s say that I have a packet at A</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:27,160 –&gt; 00:14:35,960<br>that wants to go to D. So it has the Ethernet address of D. A will send the packet. The packet will</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:35,960 –&gt; 00:14:41,560<br>propagate down the wire. So I’m going to draw it all the way along the wire here with D in it,</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:42,119 –&gt; 00:14:48,679<br>as if it’s moving from left to right. It’ll propagate at the speed of light down the wire.</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:48,679 –&gt; 00:14:53,799<br>And then it’ll come up into D. D will recognize the Ethernet address and the packet will be</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:53,799 –&gt; 00:15:01,719<br>correctly delivered. That first bit, that very first bit at the front of the packet, will start out</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:01,719 –&gt; 00:15:08,679<br>by being put under the wire here. And then it’ll propagate along and it will take it L over C,</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:08,679 –&gt; 00:15:14,759<br>if L is the length of the cable from A to D. It’ll take it L over C seconds to arrive.</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:15,879 –&gt; 00:15:23,399<br>D listens, here’s the packet. And in the meantime, while that packet is coming in, the wire is busy.</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:23,399 –&gt; 00:15:28,439<br>So B, C and D will all hear the wire is busy and won’t try and send packets. So if they’ve got</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:28,439 –&gt; 00:15:34,359<br>anything to send, they will say they’ll do the carrier sense, the step one. Say the network is busy.</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:35,000 –&gt; 00:15:43,639<br>I won’t try and send now. I’ll wait until later. Now let’s look at the condition of what causes</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:43,639 –&gt; 00:15:51,399<br>a collision in the network. So if A again has a packet destined for D and D has a packet that is</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:51,399 –&gt; 00:15:59,879<br>destined for A, A will send its packet. So let’s look at the first bit. I’m just now going to talk in</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:59,879 –&gt; 00:16:05,720<br>terms of the first bit propagating down the wire from A to D. It’ll take L over C seconds.</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:08,519 –&gt; 00:16:16,120<br>If that packet is going down the wire, here is the whole packet. And D listens and says,</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:16,120 –&gt; 00:16:22,200<br>aha, it’s quiet right now because the first bit hasn’t arrived and start sending its packet. And so</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:22,200 –&gt; 00:16:28,519<br>its packet is heading down in this direction. Its first bit is going down here. And so at some point,</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:28,519 –&gt; 00:16:33,000<br>that the front of this packet will collide with the front of this packet. And after that,</p>
<p>163<br>00:16:33,000 –&gt; 00:16:37,879<br>they will pass through each other, corrupting each other so that everyone that sees it, first of all,</p>
<p>164<br>00:16:37,879 –&gt; 00:16:44,199<br>C will see it in this case. So it will hear that there is a collision. And the way that it detects</p>
<p>165<br>00:16:44,199 –&gt; 00:16:49,559<br>the collision is through a number of mechanisms. One is it just starts to get garbled messages.</p>
<p>166<br>00:16:49,559 –&gt; 00:16:54,840<br>It sees a very much larger number of transitions, basically twice as many transitions on the wire,</p>
<p>167<br>00:16:54,840 –&gt; 00:17:00,360<br>or the main frequency component is doubled, or the voltage level has been increased. Any of these</p>
<p>168<br>00:17:00,360 –&gt; 00:17:08,279<br>mechanisms can be used to detect a collision. As the packet from D continues to head towards A,</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:08,279 –&gt; 00:17:15,160<br>that collision will soon be noted at B when the front of the packet gets to B. And so it will hear</p>
<p>170<br>00:17:15,160 –&gt; 00:17:21,240<br>the collision. And eventually that packet will reach A and it will hear the collision.</p>
<p>171<br>00:17:22,200 –&gt; 00:17:29,160<br>And of course, this packet here will hit D. And so it will hear the collision. So at all slightly</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:29,160 –&gt; 00:17:34,839<br>different times, they all hear the collision, depending on the particular time that the packets were sent.</p>
<p>173<br>00:17:37,079 –&gt; 00:17:44,200<br>So, carry a sense. Listen, see whether the line is quiet. Send the packet. Listen for the collision.</p>
<p>174<br>00:17:44,200 –&gt; 00:17:48,359<br>Then back off. The binary exponential back off is set so that there’s a good chance that they</p>
<p>175<br>00:17:48,359 –&gt; 00:17:53,559<br>will both back off by different amounts, and therefore not collide next time they send.</p>
<p>176<br>00:17:55,719 –&gt; 00:18:01,240<br>See some ACD networks have a minimum packet size requirement. Let me explain why that is.</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:02,279 –&gt; 00:18:06,839<br>Going back to my example of when A and D were sending packets to each other,</p>
<p>178<br>00:18:06,839 –&gt; 00:18:13,479<br>imagine now that A and D are sending packets on this network of length L and speed of propagation C.</p>
<p>179<br>00:18:13,720 –&gt; 00:18:23,160<br>Imagine that the first bit of the packet from A, so remember we have packet from A, oops,</p>
<p>180<br>00:18:23,160 –&gt; 00:18:32,039<br>to D, and we have packets from D to A. D listens. Here that the, here’s that the wire is quiet.</p>
<p>181<br>00:18:32,599 –&gt; 00:18:41,880<br>And at time zero, so this is going to be T equals zero. The first bit of A from A is going to start</p>
<p>182<br>00:18:41,880 –&gt; 00:18:50,200<br>propagating down here towards D. Now imagine that at a time, just a tiny tiny little bit,</p>
<p>183<br>00:18:50,200 –&gt; 00:18:58,440<br>L over C minus delta, just a tiny time period before that first bit reaches D. Host D</p>
<p>184<br>00:18:58,440 –&gt; 00:19:03,400<br>decides that it’s going to send its packet. It listens to the wire, says that it’s idle,</p>
<p>185<br>00:19:03,400 –&gt; 00:19:08,600<br>and then starts to transmit its packet. So the packet almost immediately climbs,</p>
<p>186<br>00:19:09,079 –&gt; 00:19:20,919<br>and at time delta later, the collision will be detected at D and D will stop transmitting almost immediately.</p>
<p>187<br>00:19:22,679 –&gt; 00:19:27,000<br>Now, although D knows about the collision, A doesn’t know about the collision yet because that</p>
<p>188<br>00:19:27,000 –&gt; 00:19:34,759<br>information or that collision has not propagated to A. So that little fragment of what D has sent</p>
<p>189<br>00:19:34,759 –&gt; 00:19:39,960<br>will propagate down here. So this is the collision propagating down. And so eventually the</p>
<p>190<br>00:19:39,960 –&gt; 00:19:47,000<br>propagation, the first bit will reach here. If A is still sending the packet towards D, in other</p>
<p>191<br>00:19:47,000 –&gt; 00:19:52,039<br>words, if it hasn’t reached the end of the packet yet, then A will detect the collision as well.</p>
<p>192<br>00:19:54,759 –&gt; 00:20:00,839<br>And it will detect that collision after L over C from when it started, and then another L over C</p>
<p>193<br>00:20:00,919 –&gt; 00:20:06,519<br>until the packet is finished. So there’s two L over C in the worst case is the time from when A</p>
<p>194<br>00:20:06,519 –&gt; 00:20:14,759<br>starts sending a packet until it hears of the collision. If A had finished sending its packet,</p>
<p>195<br>00:20:15,799 –&gt; 00:20:22,119<br>by the time the collision propagated to it, A wouldn’t realize that the collision took place,</p>
<p>196<br>00:20:22,119 –&gt; 00:20:26,839<br>and when it hears about the collision, it wouldn’t know what packet had caused the collision. Had it</p>
<p>197<br>00:20:26,839 –&gt; 00:20:32,919<br>been its own packet, had it been a packet from another host. So in order for a simple way for A to</p>
<p>198<br>00:20:32,919 –&gt; 00:20:39,000<br>be sure that it stops and realizes that there was a collision needs to back off and retransmit the packet,</p>
<p>199<br>00:20:39,559 –&gt; 00:20:45,720<br>one simple way to do this is to make sure that A is sending its packet for at least two L over C.</p>
<p>200<br>00:20:46,679 –&gt; 00:20:51,399<br>In other words, in the worst case, it’s guaranteed to hear about the collision before it stops</p>
<p>201<br>00:20:51,400 –&gt; 00:20:57,960<br>transmitting the packet. This means that we have a requirement of P over R, the packet length</p>
<p>202<br>00:20:57,960 –&gt; 00:21:06,759<br>divided by the rate, is greater than or equal to 2 L over C. This is a general requirement for</p>
<p>203<br>00:21:06,759 –&gt; 00:21:12,360<br>CSMA CD networks in order to be able to detect a collision while it’s still transmitting a packet.</p>
<p>204<br>00:21:13,320 –&gt; 00:21:19,800<br>Let’s look at an example. Imagine that I have a CSMA CD network, which is running at a rate of</p>
<p>205<br>00:21:19,879 –&gt; 00:21:28,680<br>10 megabits per second, and let’s say it’s 10,000 meters long, 10 kilometers long.</p>
<p>206<br>00:21:29,799 –&gt; 00:21:34,839<br>It’s a pretty big network, and that the speed of propagation is 2 times 10 to the 8 meters per second.</p>
<p>207<br>00:21:34,839 –&gt; 00:21:41,319<br>What we need P over R is greater than or equal to 2 L over C. So we can say P must be greater than or</p>
<p>208<br>00:21:41,399 –&gt; 00:21:53,159<br>equal to 2 times L, 10 to the 4 times, well I have just moved the R over under the other side,</p>
<p>209<br>00:21:53,159 –&gt; 00:22:03,000<br>so 10 to the 7 divided by 2 times 10 to the 8. So the 2 is going to cancel, and I’ve got 11 over 8 is</p>
<p>210<br>00:22:03,720 –&gt; 00:22:09,879<br>1,000 bits. So what that would tell me is that for a CSMA CD network to operate correctly at</p>
<p>211<br>00:22:09,880 –&gt; 00:22:16,600<br>that size and those rates, the minimum size packet has to be 1,000 bits or about 128 bytes.</p>
<p>212<br>00:22:17,400 –&gt; 00:22:23,880<br>So in summary, we’ve seen how MediaMaxS control protocols are used starting with a low-har,</p>
<p>213<br>00:22:23,880 –&gt; 00:22:29,800<br>nice simple random access protocol, and then improved in its performance to create CSMA CD.</p>
<p>214<br>00:22:30,600 –&gt; 00:22:37,960<br>And we saw that CSMA CD is very simple, nice random access mechanism, and we learned that the</p>
<p>215<br>00:22:37,960 –&gt; 00:22:44,519<br>minimum packet size P over R has to be greater than 2 L over C in order to be able to reliably detect</p>
<p>216<br>00:22:45,480 –&gt; 00:22:50,920<br>collisions before we finish transmitting a packet. In the next video, I’m going to be explaining</p>
<p>217<br>00:22:50,920 –&gt; 00:22:57,160<br>how CSMA CD was used in the original Ethernet, and then how Ethernet has evolved over time,</p>
<p>218<br>00:22:57,160 –&gt; 00:22:59,160<br>and then end with Ethernet switching.</p>
