                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:10,679<br>So that’s a regular expression pattern matching that we implement by constructing and simulating</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:10,679 –&gt; 00:00:13,400<br>a non-deterministic finite state machine.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,400 –&gt; 00:00:17,400<br>Really one of the most ingenious algorithms that we look at in this course.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,400 –&gt; 00:00:20,199<br>Next we’ll look at some applications.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:20,199 –&gt; 00:00:27,280<br>So the most famous is called Grep and this is what Ken Thompson implemented in the initial</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:27,280 –&gt; 00:00:35,480<br>UNIX and it was a very very important tool for programers working on the tiny, really</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:35,480 –&gt; 00:00:45,040<br>tiny computers that were available at that time was really important to be able to ask questions</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:45,040 –&gt; 00:00:52,079<br>about programs of this type and allowed the development of bigger and bigger computational</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:52,079 –&gt; 00:00:57,399<br>infrastructure like the UNIX operating system that’s still widely used today.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:57,399 –&gt; 00:01:01,920<br>So Grep was a simple command.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:01,920 –&gt; 00:01:07,239<br>What you want to do is take a regular expression as a command line argument and print the lines</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:07,239 –&gt; 00:01:12,719<br>from standard input that have some substring that’s matched by the regular expression.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:12,719 –&gt; 00:01:16,319<br>Programers use that all the time to try to figure out what variables they use and what</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:16,319 –&gt; 00:01:23,239<br>part of what program and many programmers use Grep every day still today.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:23,239 –&gt; 00:01:31,439<br>And here’s how we implement it using the code that we’ve talked about so far.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:31,439 –&gt; 00:01:41,479<br>So first thing is create the RE that we’re going to match to make it more like substring</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:41,479 –&gt; 00:01:42,479<br>search.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:42,480 –&gt; 00:01:49,359<br>We don’t care if the thing’s in there anywhere at all so we put a dot star before and after</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:49,359 –&gt; 00:01:56,359<br>and we close it in parentheses just because our code simplified it’s our reason closed in</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:56,359 –&gt; 00:01:58,760<br>a parentheses.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:58,760 –&gt; 00:02:05,960<br>Build an NFA from that regular expression and then as long as there’s an align in standard</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:05,960 –&gt; 00:02:11,280<br>input we read the line and we ask if the NFA recognizes it.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:11,280 –&gt; 00:02:16,719<br>So the constructor builds the NFA and recognizes the simulation.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:16,719 –&gt; 00:02:21,800<br>If run the NFA on that string if it’s there you print it out.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:21,800 –&gt; 00:02:28,080<br>If it doesn’t recognize it the final except state is not in the set of states it could</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:28,080 –&gt; 00:02:33,319<br>get due for that string you will print it out and we just do that for every line in the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:33,319 –&gt; 00:02:34,319<br>input.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:34,319 –&gt; 00:02:46,400<br>It’s really amazingly simple implementation although quite elegant conceptually it’s a</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:46,400 –&gt; 00:02:55,799<br>very elegant and efficient implementation of this basic process that’s Grep.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:55,799 –&gt; 00:03:03,359<br>So in the bottom line for it is in the worst case it’s the same as for the elementary</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:03,360 –&gt; 00:03:07,800<br>substring search algorithm that we looked at when we first started talking about string</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:07,800 –&gt; 00:03:08,800<br>searching.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:08,800 –&gt; 00:03:10,320<br>It’s really amazing.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:10,320 –&gt; 00:03:14,920<br>The brute force algorithm that you come up with is that try matching the string, the</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:14,920 –&gt; 00:03:20,440<br>single string at every character position worst cases time proportional to M times N.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:20,440 –&gt; 00:03:26,040<br>But here we have a regular expression which specifies an infinite set of patterns and</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:26,040 –&gt; 00:03:31,480<br>we can tell if anyone of those infinite set of patterns is matched by our string in the</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:31,479 –&gt; 00:03:33,479<br>same worst case time.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:33,479 –&gt; 00:03:40,199<br>It’s really amazing algorithm that’s Ken Thompson the Grep.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:40,199 –&gt; 00:03:46,560<br>Once you have Grep available then crossword puzzles become a lot easier.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:46,560 –&gt; 00:03:51,319<br>A lot of it’s standard and unix to have a dictionary or if you can’t find one on your</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:51,319 –&gt; 00:03:53,599<br>system we have one on the book site.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:53,599 –&gt; 00:03:58,959<br>This simply has all the words in the dictionary all in lower case one per line.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:58,960 –&gt; 00:04:04,840<br>And if you have a crossword puzzle where you’re missing a couple of letters you can just</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:04,840 –&gt; 00:04:16,280<br>Grep for in words.text and leave don’t care for those letters and it’ll tell you about</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:16,280 –&gt; 00:04:18,280<br>the things you can put in there in this case.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:18,280 –&gt; 00:04:23,040<br>It’s the one that has exactly that many letters it’s stricter.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:23,040 –&gt; 00:04:25,040<br>So that’s a typical application.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:25,040 –&gt; 00:04:29,400<br>I’m sure lots of people use it that way now.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:29,400 –&gt; 00:04:38,360<br>Now for industrial strength nowadays there’s lots of things that people expect when using</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:38,360 –&gt; 00:04:40,960<br>regular expressions.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:40,960 –&gt; 00:04:45,360<br>Our implementation doesn’t have character classes.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:45,360 –&gt; 00:04:51,000<br>It doesn’t have the extra medic characters like plus and other things.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:51,000 –&gt; 00:04:57,360<br>There’s the idea of capturing which is actually get the part of the string that satisfies</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:57,360 –&gt; 00:05:00,480<br>that matches that regular expression.</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:00,480 –&gt; 00:05:07,879<br>Various different extensions of closure and then there’s the idea of review versus reluctant</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:07,879 –&gt; 00:05:09,399<br>matching.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:09,399 –&gt; 00:05:19,759<br>So for example if you have a regular expression blank dot star, backslash blank which you’d</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:19,759 –&gt; 00:05:26,159<br>find in HTML for the blinking text, there’s two possibilities.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:26,159 –&gt; 00:05:30,120<br>So-called reluctant matching would be like the tightest match matches that you get.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:30,120 –&gt; 00:05:32,240<br>You’d have two of them.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:32,240 –&gt; 00:05:37,399<br>But then the greedy matching would get as much text as it possibly could in different</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:37,399 –&gt; 00:05:38,399<br>applications.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:38,399 –&gt; 00:05:41,000<br>You might want different things.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:41,000 –&gt; 00:05:47,680<br>Capturing means give me the substring that matches.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:47,680 –&gt; 00:05:54,199<br>So those things are not difficult to add to the basic code that we’ve done and all that</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:54,199 –&gt; 00:05:58,759<br>has to be in industrial strength implementation.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:58,759 –&gt; 00:06:04,120<br>Many programming systems have Grap that have all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:04,120 –&gt; 00:06:09,720<br>Again the originated Grap originated in Unix in the 1970s and nowadays every language has</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:09,720 –&gt; 00:06:15,800<br>to have some kind of extended regular expression facility.</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:15,800 –&gt; 00:06:24,120<br>There’s language Unix commands like Grap and O.K. and O. programmers tools like EMAX,</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:24,120 –&gt; 00:06:30,280<br>this modern programmers tools like Pearl or PHP, Python and JavaScript, all of these things</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:30,280 –&gt; 00:06:33,840<br>have regular expression processing.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:33,840 –&gt; 00:06:40,160<br>And so programmers demand this facility nowadays.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:40,160 –&gt; 00:06:47,000<br>In fact Pearl is an example of an entire language that’s built on regular expression.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:47,000 –&gt; 00:06:50,800<br>And again there’s various command line options.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:50,800 –&gt; 00:06:58,680<br>You can say I’ve run it for each line and you have replacement facilities and many other</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:58,680 –&gt; 00:07:08,800<br>things that is certainly a worthwhile facility for any programming to use nowadays.</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:08,800 –&gt; 00:07:10,840<br>And many programs use these things.</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:10,840 –&gt; 00:07:17,600<br>Now again to go back to the slide that was filled up with regular expression, you want</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:17,600 –&gt; 00:07:19,400<br>to use these things wisely.</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:19,400 –&gt; 00:07:24,759<br>There are definitely computational tasks where it might be better to just write a Java program</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:24,759 –&gt; 00:07:27,120<br>and not try to use a regular expression.</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:27,120 –&gt; 00:07:35,120<br>So every tool has its place and trying to do everything with a regular expression language.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:35,120 –&gt; 00:07:43,040<br>And Java various facilities are built in to different parts of the Java library.</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:43,040 –&gt; 00:07:53,439<br>And so understanding how the implementation works, you can understand how to use these.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:53,439 –&gt; 00:07:59,840<br>So one simple implementation is in the Java string library.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:59,839 –&gt; 00:08:07,439<br>So if you have a string called input and another string called regx and the matches method</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:07,439 –&gt; 00:08:14,199<br>in the string library, it returns a bullion that says if the string is in the language</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:14,199 –&gt; 00:08:17,039<br>described by the regular expression.</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:17,039 –&gt; 00:08:25,559<br>So this is just a simple stub called validate that takes a regular expression and an input</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:25,560 –&gt; 00:08:32,120<br>from the command line unless you know if the string is in the language described by</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:32,120 –&gt; 00:08:34,000<br>the regular expression.</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:34,000 –&gt; 00:08:39,639<br>So like as I did in 123, I leave a little Java identifier giving that regx for legal Java</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:39,639 –&gt; 00:08:43,320<br>identifier as we looked at earlier and so forth.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:43,320 –&gt; 00:08:45,320<br>So that’s one thing that’s built into Java.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:45,320 –&gt; 00:08:53,679<br>So in Java programs you can use regular expression pattern matching in that simple way.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:53,679 –&gt; 00:09:03,719<br>Another thing, another kind of task that is better handled with this handle with the</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:03,719 –&gt; 00:09:07,279<br>Java implementation is the idea of harvesting.</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:07,279 –&gt; 00:09:13,079<br>So we want to print all the substrings of the input that match a given RE.</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:13,079 –&gt; 00:09:17,679<br>So say this is the fragile X syndrome.</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:17,679 –&gt; 00:09:24,000<br>We want to harvest all the patterns from the DNA that have this property of it starts</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:24,000 –&gt; 00:09:34,439<br>with GCG and ends with CTG and has any number of these CGG or AGG triples inside.</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:34,439 –&gt; 00:09:41,439<br>Or maybe you want to harvest the same program, harvest all email addresses from a web page.</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:41,440 –&gt; 00:09:50,160<br>It’s kind of amazing that the same program can work for such a diverse task.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:50,160 –&gt; 00:09:54,600<br>That’s the testimony to the utility of the substraction.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:54,600 –&gt; 00:09:58,000<br>So how do we do harvesting within Java?</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:58,000 –&gt; 00:10:04,880<br>Well it’s got a Java has two classes called pattern and matcher that implement regular</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:04,879 –&gt; 00:10:12,480<br>expression pattern matching basically by as we did separating the construction of the</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:12,480 –&gt; 00:10:15,879<br>machine from the simulation.</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:15,879 –&gt; 00:10:20,000<br>So this is what the code looks like for harvester.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:20,000 –&gt; 00:10:24,039<br>We take our regular expression as the first command line argument and we set up an input</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:24,039 –&gt; 00:10:31,039<br>stream from the second command line argument, can be a file or a web page and then we read</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:31,039 –&gt; 00:10:33,440<br>the input stream.</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:33,440 –&gt; 00:10:41,800<br>Then we use Java’s pattern class to build a pattern which essentially is an NFA that</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:41,800 –&gt; 00:10:46,160<br>is constructed from the regular expression.</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:46,160 –&gt; 00:10:56,320<br>In the pattern class has a method called matcher and that essentially creates an NFA simulator</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:56,320 –&gt; 00:11:01,760<br>from that NFA for that text.</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:01,759 –&gt; 00:11:09,960<br>So that’s a machine that not only does matching the way that we did but it also finds a match</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:09,960 –&gt; 00:11:17,639<br>and keeps track of what’s called group which is the substring that causes the match.</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:17,639 –&gt; 00:11:26,000<br>So that’s that extra code to do these things that are useful in this illustrates one line</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:26,000 –&gt; 00:11:29,720<br>of code for each one of those facilities.</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:29,720 –&gt; 00:11:35,920<br>It is create the NFA, create the simulator, find an x-match and get the substring that</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:35,920 –&gt; 00:11:37,560<br>causes the match.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:37,560 –&gt; 00:11:46,160<br>That’s an implementation of harvester that can go through and do things like get fragilex</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:46,160 –&gt; 00:11:52,279<br>indicators from a chromosome or get email addresses from a web page.</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:52,279 –&gt; 00:11:56,399<br>And of course you could extend that to print out the index of where they occur and other</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:56,399 –&gt; 00:11:57,399<br>things.</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:57,399 –&gt; 00:12:03,639<br>It’s a very powerful facility to have in a programming language in Java and certainly</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:03,639 –&gt; 00:12:05,159<br>has it.</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:05,159 –&gt; 00:12:09,120<br>Now there is a caveat about this that’s really important.</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:09,120 –&gt; 00:12:15,360<br>This introduces the idea that we talked about with hashing and this is another example of</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:15,360 –&gt; 00:12:18,679<br>the algorithmic complexity attack.</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:18,679 –&gt; 00:12:26,039<br>That is if you know something about the way that a website is implemented at facility,</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:26,039 –&gt; 00:12:33,719<br>in this case it’s possible to implement regular expression pattern matching in a not so</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:33,719 –&gt; 00:12:35,719<br>efficient way.</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:35,719 –&gt; 00:12:42,759<br>And it typically actually the implementation that we see out in the wild like the ones in</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:42,759 –&gt; 00:12:49,639<br>Munich or Java or Pearl do not guarantee quadratic performance the way we have.</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:49,639 –&gt; 00:12:53,000<br>They do not guarantee that any time it’s going to be proportional to the product of the</p>
<p>140<br>00:12:53,000 –&gt; 00:12:56,440<br>link to the string and the link to the regular expression.</p>
<p>141<br>00:12:56,440 –&gt; 00:12:57,960<br>In fact they go exponential.</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:57,960 –&gt; 00:13:06,039<br>Again going back to cleanies theorem it’s relatively simple to prove and it’s not so</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:06,039 –&gt; 00:13:11,919<br>difficult to develop an implementation that is more like cleanies theorem but it can take</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:11,919 –&gt; 00:13:14,000<br>exponential time.</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:14,000 –&gt; 00:13:23,399<br>And you can try it yourself in Java or Pearl if you try to look for a match for this regular</p>
<p>146<br>00:13:23,399 –&gt; 00:13:26,720<br>expression in a string like that.</p>
<p>147<br>00:13:26,720 –&gt; 00:13:31,320<br>You add just a couple characters to the string the running time will double.</p>
<p>148<br>00:13:31,320 –&gt; 00:13:37,080<br>Again going back to our algorithmic performance lectures.</p>
<p>149<br>00:13:37,080 –&gt; 00:13:41,759<br>If that’s what happens if I just add one thing in my running time doubles that means I have</p>
<p>150<br>00:13:41,759 –&gt; 00:13:44,279<br>exponential time.</p>
<p>151<br>00:13:44,279 –&gt; 00:13:56,600<br>And so if I’m using a facility that has one of these exponential time implementation then</p>
<p>152<br>00:13:56,600 –&gt; 00:14:02,360<br>this is what’s called spam assassin regular expression.</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:02,360 –&gt; 00:14:08,600<br>It’s going to take exponential time on certain email addresses and somebody can create trouble</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:08,680 –&gt; 00:14:14,200<br>by sending such addresses to a mail server.</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:14,200 –&gt; 00:14:21,399<br>The mail server will take exponential time just trying to determine if it’s spam or not.</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:21,399 –&gt; 00:14:29,920<br>By having an inefficient algorithm a server like that is definitely subject to such attacks.</p>
<p>157<br>00:14:29,920 –&gt; 00:14:32,680<br>Generally you don’t want to have exponential algorithms.</p>
<p>158<br>00:14:32,680 –&gt; 00:14:36,120<br>You particularly don’t want to have exponential algorithms.</p>
<p>159<br>00:14:36,120 –&gt; 00:14:43,039<br>If you have arbitrary clients out there that can cause trouble for you.</p>
<p>160<br>00:14:43,039 –&gt; 00:14:49,279<br>Another pitfall is things that kind of look like regular expressions but aren’t actually</p>
<p>161<br>00:14:49,279 –&gt; 00:14:50,960<br>regular expressions.</p>
<p>162<br>00:14:50,960 –&gt; 00:14:53,840<br>So it’s common to have the backslash one notation.</p>
<p>163<br>00:14:53,840 –&gt; 00:15:00,440<br>So that’s supposed to match the sub expression that was matched earlier.</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:00,440 –&gt; 00:15:11,440<br>So this thing dot plus backslash one is a string that is two copies of something like</p>
<p>165<br>00:15:11,440 –&gt; 00:15:15,480<br>Kuskou’s with the least one character.</p>
<p>166<br>00:15:15,480 –&gt; 00:15:17,680<br>And this one is a similar one.</p>
<p>167<br>00:15:17,680 –&gt; 00:15:22,160<br>This one actually is a number of ones is not prime.</p>
<p>168<br>00:15:22,160 –&gt; 00:15:23,160<br>It matches.</p>
<p>169<br>00:15:23,160 –&gt; 00:15:30,400<br>So you can write pretty sophisticated computationally things just with these little references.</p>
<p>170<br>00:15:30,399 –&gt; 00:15:32,240<br>But there’s a problem.</p>
<p>171<br>00:15:32,240 –&gt; 00:15:40,199<br>It’s a fundamental problem is that the kinds of languages of the sets of strings that you</p>
<p>172<br>00:15:40,199 –&gt; 00:15:43,559<br>specify with such notation are not regular.</p>
<p>173<br>00:15:43,559 –&gt; 00:15:49,519<br>That is, I guess, at the point you can’t write a regular expression to specify them.</p>
<p>174<br>00:15:49,519 –&gt; 00:15:55,039<br>And so these are examples like strings of the form w for some w.</p>
<p>175<br>00:15:55,039 –&gt; 00:16:01,279<br>You can’t write a regular expression that will describe all such strings.</p>
<p>176<br>00:16:01,279 –&gt; 00:16:05,399<br>Even scientific applications like complemented palindrome.</p>
<p>177<br>00:16:05,399 –&gt; 00:16:12,000<br>So that’s like a palindrome but also complement A’s to T’s and C’s to G’s.</p>
<p>178<br>00:16:12,000 –&gt; 00:16:15,000<br>So that’s another example.</p>
<p>179<br>00:16:15,000 –&gt; 00:16:19,319<br>And if they’re not regular then Cleamy’s theorem doesn’t hold.</p>
<p>180<br>00:16:19,320 –&gt; 00:16:22,320<br>There’s no NFA that corresponds to them.</p>
<p>181<br>00:16:22,320 –&gt; 00:16:29,320<br>And in fact, we’ll talk in a couple of lectures about interactability.</p>
<p>182<br>00:16:29,320 –&gt; 00:16:36,560<br>In fact, nobody knows an efficient method for guaranteeing performance when you have back</p>
<p>183<br>00:16:36,560 –&gt; 00:16:38,240<br>references.</p>
<p>184<br>00:16:38,240 –&gt; 00:16:44,320<br>So if you’re allowing back references, you’re pretty much subject to performance attacks</p>
<p>185<br>00:16:44,320 –&gt; 00:16:47,280<br>like the one just mentioned.</p>
<p>186<br>00:16:47,279 –&gt; 00:16:50,399<br>And that’s where we’ll finish up this lecture.</p>
<p>187<br>00:16:50,399 –&gt; 00:16:56,279<br>This is an amazingly elegant and efficient and ingenious algorithm.</p>
<p>188<br>00:16:56,279 –&gt; 00:17:01,959<br>And it’s based on the theory of computation that has been studied since the 1930s.</p>
<p>189<br>00:17:01,959 –&gt; 00:17:06,079<br>And it’s the basis for much of the programming, programming languages that we do.</p>
<p>190<br>00:17:06,079 –&gt; 00:17:08,759<br>It’s really worth understanding this theory.</p>
<p>191<br>00:17:08,759 –&gt; 00:17:15,319<br>And Grep is a wonderful example of why it’s important to understand theory like this.</p>
<p>192<br>00:17:15,319 –&gt; 00:17:19,119<br>And really, it takes us to the next level of algorithms.</p>
<p>193<br>00:17:19,119 –&gt; 00:17:25,319<br>And that’s writing programs that translate a program to machine code.</p>
<p>194<br>00:17:25,319 –&gt; 00:17:32,480<br>Actually, what we’ve looked at both for KMP and for Grep are examples of compilers.</p>
<p>195<br>00:17:32,480 –&gt; 00:17:34,919<br>They’re simple examples of compilers.</p>
<p>196<br>00:17:34,919 –&gt; 00:17:38,119<br>For KMP, we took a string and we built a DFA.</p>
<p>197<br>00:17:38,119 –&gt; 00:17:42,799<br>For Grep, we took an RE and we built an NFA.</p>
<p>198<br>00:17:42,799 –&gt; 00:17:48,919<br>And all Java C does is take Java language code and translate it to a bytecode.</p>
<p>199<br>00:17:48,919 –&gt; 00:17:55,399<br>Now it uses more complicated theorems and laws from theory of computation to get the job</p>
<p>200<br>00:17:55,399 –&gt; 00:18:01,359<br>done because a Java program is also not regular.</p>
<p>201<br>00:18:01,359 –&gt; 00:18:12,079<br>But it really is worthwhile thinking about the progression from KMP to a Java compiler,</p>
<p>202<br>00:18:12,079 –&gt; 00:18:13,759<br>as in a Java compiler.</p>
<p>203<br>00:18:13,759 –&gt; 00:18:14,759<br>You have a program.</p>
<p>204<br>00:18:14,759 –&gt; 00:18:17,759<br>You want to compile it and know if it’s legal.</p>
<p>205<br>00:18:17,759 –&gt; 00:18:19,119<br>You want to get bytecode.</p>
<p>206<br>00:18:19,119 –&gt; 00:18:25,639<br>And then you’ve got a Java simulator and that’s not so substantially different from what</p>
<p>207<br>00:18:25,639 –&gt; 00:18:30,319<br>we just did for Grep in a stage along the way.</p>
<p>208<br>00:18:30,319 –&gt; 00:18:36,439<br>It’s quite interesting to see this kind of context to get us such a practically useful</p>
<p>209<br>00:18:36,439 –&gt; 00:18:39,319<br>and important now for them.</p>
<p>210<br>00:18:39,319 –&gt; 00:18:44,480<br>So summary is we did some from the standpoint of a program.</p>
<p>211<br>00:18:44,480 –&gt; 00:18:49,000<br>We implemented substring search by simulating a DFA and we implemented a regular expression</p>
<p>212<br>00:18:49,000 –&gt; 00:18:52,759<br>pattern matching by simulating an NFA.</p>
<p>213<br>00:18:52,759 –&gt; 00:19:02,200<br>From theoretician, what’s interesting about these abstractions is that NFAs and DFA’s</p>
<p>214<br>00:19:02,200 –&gt; 00:19:05,399<br>and RE are equivalent in power.</p>
<p>215<br>00:19:05,400 –&gt; 00:19:08,440<br>You can describe a set of strings with one of them.</p>
<p>216<br>00:19:08,440 –&gt; 00:19:10,840<br>You can describe a set of strings with any of them.</p>
<p>217<br>00:19:10,840 –&gt; 00:19:12,240<br>So that’s interesting.</p>
<p>218<br>00:19:12,240 –&gt; 00:19:14,800<br>And also interesting is that there’s limitations.</p>
<p>219<br>00:19:14,800 –&gt; 00:19:23,240<br>There’s sets of strings like palindrons and so forth that you can’t specify with a DFA</p>
<p>220<br>00:19:23,240 –&gt; 00:19:25,800<br>or an NFA.</p>
<p>221<br>00:19:25,800 –&gt; 00:19:32,680<br>But from a student in an algorithm’s class, it really is worthwhile to see that these</p>
<p>222<br>00:19:32,680 –&gt; 00:19:34,759<br>principles are not just theory.</p>
<p>223<br>00:19:34,759 –&gt; 00:19:37,440<br>They’re a practical use.</p>
<p>224<br>00:19:37,440 –&gt; 00:19:41,200<br>And this is an essential paradigm all throughout computer science.</p>
<p>225<br>00:19:41,200 –&gt; 00:19:46,279<br>We want to find an intermediate abstraction that we can understand and make sure we pick</p>
<p>226<br>00:19:46,279 –&gt; 00:19:51,840<br>the right one and then we pick clients that can use it in real implementations that can</p>
<p>227<br>00:19:51,840 –&gt; 00:19:53,440<br>implement it.</p>
<p>228<br>00:19:53,440 –&gt; 00:19:59,360<br>By building the right intermediate abstraction, we can solve some important practical problems.</p>
<p>229<br>00:19:59,359 –&gt; 00:20:02,359<br>And those are the lessons that Grap teaches us.</p>
