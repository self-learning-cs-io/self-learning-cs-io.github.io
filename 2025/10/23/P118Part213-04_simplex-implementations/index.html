                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:11,200<br>Let’s take a look at what’s needed to implement the simplex algorithm in Java.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:11,200 –&gt; 00:00:17,280<br>So there’s a basic idea that’s very straightforward.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:17,280 –&gt; 00:00:22,320<br>And that’s the first thing we have to do is just put everything in an array.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:22,320 –&gt; 00:00:24,960<br>And that’s going to be a simple thing to do.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:24,960 –&gt; 00:00:39,679<br>So we have, in this case, our input is our recipe for AL and a recipe for beer in our profit,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:39,679 –&gt; 00:00:46,200<br>which is our objective function, and then the all the slack variables.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:46,200 –&gt; 00:00:54,359<br>So we put our matrix A, our M equations, and N unknowns in this part of the array.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:54,359 –&gt; 00:01:00,920<br>And then we put our slack variables next to them, and then the right-hand side to the equations,</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:00,920 –&gt; 00:01:08,319<br>which is B, and then the initial values of the objective function.</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:08,319 –&gt; 00:01:13,439<br>And we don’t have to put in the constraints that everything’s positive.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:13,439 –&gt; 00:01:15,799<br>So that’s what we start with, the tableau.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:15,799 –&gt; 00:01:23,319<br>It’s really the matrices and vectors that we have as input to the problem, all put into</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:23,319 –&gt; 00:01:25,639<br>a single array.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:25,639 –&gt; 00:01:32,559<br>And that’s, again, just to reduce the amount of code we have to worry about.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:32,559 –&gt; 00:01:41,639<br>So the idea is that when we run the algorithm, all we’re doing is transforming a few entries</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:41,639 –&gt; 00:01:43,439<br>in this array.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:43,439 –&gt; 00:01:50,399<br>And when we’re done, this is the representation of the equations that we ended up with before.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:50,400 –&gt; 00:02:02,000<br>And what they tell us is the immediately they tell us the value of the objective function.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:02,000 –&gt; 00:02:06,000<br>And not only that, they tell us how many barrels of beer and ale to make,</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:06,000 –&gt; 00:02:15,200<br>because we’re sitting at a point where we have our AMB in the basis,</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:15,199 –&gt; 00:02:21,280<br>and therefore the slack variables are zero.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:21,280 –&gt; 00:02:29,239<br>So it just tells us immediately that we better make 28 barrels of beer and 12 barrels of ale.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:29,239 –&gt; 00:02:31,719<br>So that’s the idea.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:31,719 –&gt; 00:02:34,959<br>We only just work with the elements in this tableau.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:34,959 –&gt; 00:02:40,479<br>And then all we’re going to do is write the code to build the tableau and then to do the</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:40,479 –&gt; 00:02:42,039<br>pivots.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:42,039 –&gt; 00:02:46,879<br>And this is very straightforward Java code.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:46,879 –&gt; 00:02:49,959<br>So it’s going to be two-dimensional array clearly.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:49,959 –&gt; 00:02:54,639<br>We have our number of constraints and our number of variables.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:54,639 –&gt; 00:03:07,439<br>So we’ll write a constructor that takes the constraints and then the writing side for</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:07,439 –&gt; 00:03:15,199<br>the constraints in the coefficients for the objective function as argument.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:15,199 –&gt; 00:03:20,000<br>So it picks out M and M. And so how big an array do we need?</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:20,000 –&gt; 00:03:24,039<br>M plus 1 times M plus N plus 1.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:24,039 –&gt; 00:03:30,000<br>So we just make that array and just fill it in from our argument.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:30,000 –&gt; 00:03:40,879<br>So in first the coefficients and then put the initial values of the slack variables along</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:40,879 –&gt; 00:03:43,719<br>the diagonal here.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:43,719 –&gt; 00:03:45,319<br>Java arrays are initialized to zero.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:45,319 –&gt; 00:03:48,560<br>So we’re not going to have to initialize all the others.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:48,560 –&gt; 00:03:55,920<br>And then you put the objective function and the writing side of the constraint equations</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:55,920 –&gt; 00:03:56,920<br>into the tableau.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:56,920 –&gt; 00:03:58,240<br>Simple as that.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:58,240 –&gt; 00:04:02,920<br>So every one of those lines of that code is completely transparent.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:02,920 –&gt; 00:04:10,320<br>That’s building the initial value of the tableau.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:10,320 –&gt; 00:04:19,400<br>So now we have to find the column that is going to, we’re going to pivot on.</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:19,400 –&gt; 00:04:25,160<br>So we’re going to need to pivot on some entry in the array.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:25,160 –&gt; 00:04:29,560<br>It’s going to have B and Rope B and column Q. And the rule we’ve given, which is called</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:29,560 –&gt; 00:04:30,560<br>Blan’s Rule.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:30,560 –&gt; 00:04:39,960<br>And remember, Blan does the one who wrote the classic scientific American article about beer.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:39,960 –&gt; 00:04:46,080<br>So we use Blan’s Rule to just go through and look at the last row, which is the objective</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:46,080 –&gt; 00:04:48,080<br>function and look for positive.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:48,080 –&gt; 00:04:51,680<br>So it does, it just goes through and looks for positive.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:51,680 –&gt; 00:04:54,079<br>If it finds positive, it returns that column.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:54,079 –&gt; 00:04:56,519<br>And that’s what we’re going to use.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:56,519 –&gt; 00:04:57,879<br>So it’s the first one that’s positive.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:57,879 –&gt; 00:05:01,400<br>If it’s a lot of them are positive, it always returns the first one.</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:01,400 –&gt; 00:05:03,879<br>And if it can’t find one, then it’s optimal.</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:03,879 –&gt; 00:05:04,879<br>We can stop.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:04,879 –&gt; 00:05:07,240<br>So that’s the entering column.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:07,240 –&gt; 00:05:11,000<br>We also have to find the entering row.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:11,000 –&gt; 00:05:15,120<br>And to find the entering row, we use the minimum ratio rule.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:15,120 –&gt; 00:05:21,480<br>So we just go through for all the possible rows.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:21,480 –&gt; 00:05:30,640<br>We just do this calculation involving the ratio between the current element and the element</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:30,640 –&gt; 00:05:32,480<br>that we would pivot on.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:32,480 –&gt; 00:05:35,160<br>We only worry about the positive ones.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:35,160 –&gt; 00:05:37,720<br>And so it’s just a little check.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:37,720 –&gt; 00:05:45,560<br>And again, if there’s a tie, you choose the first one and a simple calculation going through</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:45,560 –&gt; 00:05:50,560<br>all the entries to figure out which row gives you the minimum ratio and then return P.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:50,560 –&gt; 00:05:55,240<br>So now we have P and Q where we want to pivot.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:55,240 –&gt; 00:06:03,840<br>And so we have the values P and Q. And we just go through and do the pivot.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:03,840 –&gt; 00:06:10,439<br>And then this is the same calculation that you do for Gaussian elimination.</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:10,439 –&gt; 00:06:14,840<br>Scale everything zero up on Q and then scale the row.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:14,840 –&gt; 00:06:18,319<br>And I’m not going to do the details of that calculation.</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:18,319 –&gt; 00:06:23,000<br>That’s what you get when you solve for one variable sub-tune into the other equations.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:23,000 –&gt; 00:06:30,240<br>It’s the same calculation as for when you’re solving simultaneous equations.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:30,240 –&gt; 00:06:32,240<br>And that’s it.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:32,240 –&gt; 00:06:40,600<br>The simplex algorithm is just until you get a minus one return from bland, you just compute</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:40,600 –&gt; 00:06:47,480<br>Q, you compute P and pivot and keep going until you’re done.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:47,480 –&gt; 00:06:54,400<br>And then to look at your maximize value, I just look in the corner.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:54,400 –&gt; 00:06:58,400<br>Not too much code to implement D-bear bones, implementation of simplex.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:58,400 –&gt; 00:07:02,320<br>It’s fairly straightforward algorithm.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:02,320 –&gt; 00:07:09,800<br>Now what’s remarkable about it is remember in multiple dimensions, the number of points</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:09,800 –&gt; 00:07:12,560<br>in the simplex could be high, could be exponential.</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:12,560 –&gt; 00:07:17,879<br>But what’s remarkable about the simplex algorithm is still today even somewhat mysterious.</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:17,879 –&gt; 00:07:23,639<br>But certainly very mysterious for the first several decades that we’ve used is that it seems</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:23,639 –&gt; 00:07:28,519<br>to find the answer after just the linear number of pivots.</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:28,519 –&gt; 00:07:32,360<br>There’s all those points out there on the simplex.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:32,360 –&gt; 00:07:37,280<br>But when Delta Airlines is scheduling its airline pirates or an oil company is looking</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:37,279 –&gt; 00:07:42,159<br>for where to drill or wherever, our Walmart’s trying to move its trucks around, these huge</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:42,159 –&gt; 00:07:45,519<br>problems with millions of variables, it’s linear time.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:45,519 –&gt; 00:07:48,599<br>It could be exponential time, but it’s linear time.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:48,599 –&gt; 00:07:51,839<br>That’s why it’s been so effective.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:51,839 –&gt; 00:07:57,519<br>Now you could use other pivoting rules and there has certainly been a huge amount of research</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:57,519 –&gt; 00:08:01,799<br>on trying to figure out exactly what to do.</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:01,799 –&gt; 00:08:06,639<br>Nobody knows a pivot rule that’ll guarantee that the algorithm is faster, it runs a polynomial</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:06,639 –&gt; 00:08:08,199<br>time.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:08,199 –&gt; 00:08:14,199<br>Most of them are known to be exponential in the worst case, but again the real problems maybe</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:14,199 –&gt; 00:08:16,719<br>aren’t worst case.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:16,719 –&gt; 00:08:23,079<br>And certainly people have looked at all different ways to look at it to try to understand why</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:23,079 –&gt; 00:08:27,079<br>the simplex algorithm usually takes some polynomial time.</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:27,079 –&gt; 00:08:31,599<br>This is a recent paper on the topic.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:31,600 –&gt; 00:08:38,120<br>Now there are things that can happen during the execution of the algorithm that we’ve</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:38,120 –&gt; 00:08:40,720<br>lost over.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:40,720 –&gt; 00:08:48,920<br>One thing is that you could get stuck in that you could have a new basis, you could make</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:48,920 –&gt; 00:08:53,080<br>your substitution, but still wind up at the same extreme point.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:53,080 –&gt; 00:08:58,519<br>Like if a bunch of lines intersect at the same extreme point.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:58,519 –&gt; 00:09:01,160<br>So it’s called stalling.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:01,159 –&gt; 00:09:06,600<br>That’s not a good situation that you have to watch out for.</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:06,600 –&gt; 00:09:11,719<br>And the other thing is when you have this kind of degeneracy you could get in a cycle</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:11,719 –&gt; 00:09:17,839<br>where you go through different bases, always corresponding to the same extreme point.</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:17,839 –&gt; 00:09:21,639<br>It doesn’t seem to occur in practice.</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:21,639 –&gt; 00:09:26,000<br>And the way that we implement it and the way that we implement it, just choosing the</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:26,000 –&gt; 00:09:32,039<br>first one that’s planned for rule is going to guarantee that at least you don’t get caught</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:32,039 –&gt; 00:09:34,200<br>in an infinite loop which would be bad.</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:34,200 –&gt; 00:09:35,559<br>That doesn’t seem to happen anyway.</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:35,559 –&gt; 00:09:38,279<br>But it’s a problem to think about.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:38,279 –&gt; 00:09:43,759<br>There’s another thing that has to be thought about in order to actually try to use this</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:43,759 –&gt; 00:09:47,240<br>to schedule airlines or whatever.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:47,240 –&gt; 00:09:52,960<br>So you certainly have to be careful to avoid stalling.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:52,960 –&gt; 00:10:01,759<br>One thing is that most of the equations tend to involve relatively fee variables in people</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:01,759 –&gt; 00:10:05,360<br>who have experience with calculating systems of equations.</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:05,360 –&gt; 00:10:13,080<br>Know that in some situations you can find yourself filled up with lots of non-zero values.</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:13,080 –&gt; 00:10:21,400<br>So you want to take a rule that implements the thing with sparse matrix width.</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:21,400 –&gt; 00:10:27,360<br>So your amount of space you take is proportional to the number of non-zero entries.</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:27,360 –&gt; 00:10:33,920<br>So we look a couple of times at some data structures of that sort and that’s certainly a consideration</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:33,920 –&gt; 00:10:36,639<br>in simplex implementations.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:36,639 –&gt; 00:10:40,560<br>The other thing that we haven’t talked about much in this course, but whenever you’re</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:40,559 –&gt; 00:10:46,079<br>working with floating point approximations of real numbers and you’re making a lot of calculations,</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:46,079 –&gt; 00:10:51,039<br>you have to make sure that you have control over the errors in the calculations.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:51,039 –&gt; 00:10:56,959<br>And scientific computation is certainly concerned with keeping control of that situation.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:56,959 –&gt; 00:11:02,399<br>It’s something that we haven’t talked about much in this course.</p>
<p>131<br>00:11:02,399 –&gt; 00:11:10,439<br>And the other thing is that actually it could be the case that your constraints are infeasible</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:10,440 –&gt; 00:11:12,760<br>there’s no way to satisfy them.</p>
<p>133<br>00:11:12,760 –&gt; 00:11:20,040<br>And it’s a bad idea to run simplex for infeasible situations because we won’t ever get to the optimum.</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:20,040 –&gt; 00:11:27,040<br>So typically what we have to do in practice is run a different simplex algorithm</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:27,040 –&gt; 00:11:30,760<br>on a transformed version of the problem.</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:30,760 –&gt; 00:11:34,680<br>And there’s really interesting theory behind that all.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:34,680 –&gt; 00:11:40,400<br>And it’s used the same code to figure out an infeasibility, but it has something that has to be done.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:40,399 –&gt; 00:11:44,480<br>And the other possibilities are not enough constraints.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:44,480 –&gt; 00:11:51,840<br>So that you missed one of those half planes, you missed somewhere and then it gets infinite.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:51,840 –&gt; 00:11:56,000<br>And that’s also a situation that you want to avoid.</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:56,000 –&gt; 00:12:01,679<br>And with the code that we gave, that would be the case where you’ve planned for you to find a column</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:01,679 –&gt; 00:12:04,639<br>and looking for a row and there’s no row.</p>
<p>143<br>00:12:04,639 –&gt; 00:12:07,199<br>So you have to check for that as well.</p>
<p>144<br>00:12:07,200 –&gt; 00:12:13,759<br>And each one of these things is complicated enough that in this case we’ve probably say the best practices</p>
<p>145<br>00:12:13,759 –&gt; 00:12:23,879<br>don’t go in and try to implement simplex unless you’re prepared to devote really substantial amount of time to it.</p>
<p>146<br>00:12:23,879 –&gt; 00:12:32,759<br>And there’s really no need to do that nowadays because basic implementations of simplex are readily available</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:32,759 –&gt; 00:12:36,600<br>in many different programming environments.</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:36,600 –&gt; 00:12:44,200<br>And routinely nowadays people solve LPs with millions of variables.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:44,200 –&gt; 00:12:49,639<br>The airline, and they’re so easy to reduce practical problems to an AP.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:49,639 –&gt; 00:12:52,000<br>And LPs just throw in another constraint.</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:52,000 –&gt; 00:13:00,200<br>Any constraints that you might have, certain pilot doesn’t want to be scheduled early in the day or late in the day or union rules or whatever.</p>
<p>152<br>00:13:00,200 –&gt; 00:13:08,920<br>You just put all these things in as constraints without worrying that much about it and then add more variables whatever you need to do.</p>
<p>153<br>00:13:08,920 –&gt; 00:13:18,759<br>And then send it to an industrial strength solver and people nowadays solve LPs with huge numbers of variables.</p>
<p>154<br>00:13:18,759 –&gt; 00:13:30,160<br>And not only are there solvers nowadays there’s modeling languages that make it even easier to write down the LP.</p>
<p>155<br>00:13:30,159 –&gt; 00:13:39,600<br>And so there’s plenty of resources available to make use of the simplex algorithm nowadays.</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:39,600 –&gt; 00:13:47,319<br>And it’s important, this is a important quote from just a few years ago that’s worth reviewing.</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:47,319 –&gt; 00:13:55,600<br>So they have, this is so widely used, they have benchmarks on how well linear programming implementations do.</p>
<p>158<br>00:13:55,680 –&gt; 00:14:05,320<br>So even in 1988, not all that far back, they have a benchmark that would have taken 82 years to solve.</p>
<p>159<br>00:14:05,320 –&gt; 00:14:08,519<br>And even that’s just a guess.</p>
<p>160<br>00:14:08,519 –&gt; 00:14:13,279<br>And using the best linear programming algorithms the day would take 82 years.</p>
<p>161<br>00:14:13,279 –&gt; 00:14:17,920<br>But just 15 years later, you could solve the same problem in one minute.</p>
<p>162<br>00:14:17,920 –&gt; 00:14:21,680<br>That’s a factor of 43 million.</p>
<p>163<br>00:14:21,679 –&gt; 00:14:25,559<br>Of this factor of 1,000 was due to increased processor speed.</p>
<p>164<br>00:14:25,559 –&gt; 00:14:29,359<br>So 15 years we have computers that are a thousand times faster.</p>
<p>165<br>00:14:29,359 –&gt; 00:14:34,159<br>But 43,000 is due to algorithm improvements.</p>
<p>166<br>00:14:34,159 –&gt; 00:14:37,279<br>And there’s been more even since then.</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:37,279 –&gt; 00:14:46,399<br>So the importance of knowing good algorithms and working with good algorithms is unquestioned in this case.</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:46,399 –&gt; 00:14:52,959<br>And of course, this algorithm is still being heavily, heavily studied.</p>
<p>169<br>00:14:52,959 –&gt; 00:15:03,079<br>So starting with Danzig’s simplex algorithm and other basic knowledge about the algorithm and about linear programming.</p>
<p>170<br>00:15:03,079 –&gt; 00:15:09,840<br>That was applied in practice in 1948.</p>
<p>171<br>00:15:09,840 –&gt; 00:15:19,440<br>And it’s basic idea of linear programming actually precedes Danzig and actually went up with the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>172<br>00:15:19,440 –&gt; 00:15:29,000<br>But what’s interesting is there was, the algorithm was so good, there was actually not much development for about three decades.</p>
<p>173<br>00:15:29,000 –&gt; 00:15:38,759<br>But then an amazing surprising result, Kachian proved that you could solve linear programming problems</p>
<p>174<br>00:15:38,759 –&gt; 00:15:40,200<br>in polynomial time.</p>
<p>175<br>00:15:40,200 –&gt; 00:15:42,600<br>That was quite a shock at the time.</p>
<p>176<br>00:15:42,600 –&gt; 00:15:47,480<br>And we’ll talk more about that in the last lecture of the course.</p>
<p>177<br>00:15:47,480 –&gt; 00:15:55,000<br>And then since then, knowing that there are algorithms that potentially could beat simplex,</p>
<p>178<br>00:15:55,000 –&gt; 00:15:58,840<br>people have actually developed algorithms that do beat simplex.</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:58,840 –&gt; 00:16:05,799<br>And so there’s still a great deal of research going on on the simplex,</p>
<p>180<br>00:16:05,799 –&gt; 00:16:09,959<br>on implementations of linear programming solvers.</p>
<p>181<br>00:16:09,959 –&gt; 00:16:14,359<br>That’s a quick outline of what it means to implement and solve linear programming.</p>
