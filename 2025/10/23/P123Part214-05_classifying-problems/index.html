                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:11,439<br>Okay, so next we’ll look at what the idea of the class is P and N P, a mean in terms of</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:11,439 –&gt; 00:00:17,519<br>the actual problems we’re looking at solving. We want to classify our problems the same way</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:17,519 –&gt; 00:00:24,000<br>it’s which scientists classify elements and the key technique that we’re going to use</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:24,000 –&gt; 00:00:33,920<br>is reduction. So the problem that we’re going to start with that is the key to this theory is the</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:33,920 –&gt; 00:00:40,640<br>Boolean-Satisfy-Builded problem. And we talked about at the beginning it’s not that different</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:40,640 –&gt; 00:00:46,240<br>than Gaussian and then systems of linear equations just that everything has to be Boolean variables.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:46,240 –&gt; 00:00:56,960<br>And so given a system of Boolean equations find a solution. And even on its own it’s a very</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:56,960 –&gt; 00:01:05,680<br>significant problem. It has come it comes up and people solve huge and face huge</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:05,680 –&gt; 00:01:13,280<br>satisfiability problems in trying to understand whether trying to prove whether software to verify</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:13,280 –&gt; 00:01:23,359<br>software works correctly. Also hardware for design automation people model what’s going on with</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:23,359 –&gt; 00:01:32,960<br>huge satisfiability problems in solving. It’s so basic that it even arises in physics and</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:32,960 –&gt; 00:01:39,439<br>scientific studies in the so-called mean field deluded spin glass model. That’s a very fundamental</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:40,319 –&gt; 00:01:49,679<br>problem that is just about logical reasoning about what’s going on in some complex system.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:51,439 –&gt; 00:01:57,439<br>Now the question is so it’s a search problem we know of that and what that means is that</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:59,200 –&gt; 00:02:02,879<br>if we have a solution we can efficiently check that we have a solution.</p>
<p>16<br>00:02:02,959 –&gt; 00:02:12,560<br>But the question is is it in P? Can we find an algorithm that guarantees to find a solution</p>
<p>17<br>00:02:12,560 –&gt; 00:02:21,519<br>in polynomial time? Now people solve huge problems but in some sense maybe they’re lucky because</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:21,519 –&gt; 00:02:27,359<br>the instances that they’re trying to solve don’t cause the algorithm to run in polynomial time.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:28,160 –&gt; 00:02:33,360<br>But the real question is can we guarantee that we’ll get done in a polynomial time?</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:34,800 –&gt; 00:02:44,240<br>So well what do we do? Well for satisfiability as I mentioned it’s pretty easy to use exhaustive</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:44,240 –&gt; 00:02:50,720<br>search. Just try all the truth assignments. And really what that means is they have an algorithm</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:50,720 –&gt; 00:02:56,720<br>that if it doesn’t find the right truth assignment it might wind up trying all of them. But you might</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:56,719 –&gt; 00:03:03,520<br>find one earlier and that’s what happens in practice. But the big question is can we do anything that’s</p>
<p>24<br>00:03:03,520 –&gt; 00:03:11,520<br>really substantially more clever than SAT and the brute force algorithm that is an algorithm run</p>
<p>25<br>00:03:11,520 –&gt; 00:03:18,960<br>brute force in the worst case. That’s a pretty stringent definition of substantially. But that’s the</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:18,960 –&gt; 00:03:26,320<br>one that we’re talking about. Can we get less than exponential worst case performance?</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:27,120 –&gt; 00:03:32,480<br>And some people have worked on this for long enough now that most people agree that</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:33,920 –&gt; 00:03:40,960<br>there’s no polynomial time algorithm for SAT. To start classifying problems what we’re going to do is</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:42,240 –&gt; 00:03:46,960<br>kind of adopt that as an assumption or at least we’ll classify problems</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:47,760 –&gt; 00:03:55,120<br>according to the difficulty of SAT. And what that means is we’re going to use reduction from SAT.</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:55,760 –&gt; 00:04:04,080<br>So if we reduce SAT to some problem as we talked about in the reduction letter lecture that means if</p>
<p>32<br>00:04:04,080 –&gt; 00:04:08,719<br>we could solve that problem efficiently we also could solve SAT efficiently and we’re going to</p>
<p>33<br>00:04:09,680 –&gt; 00:04:16,000<br>call a problem like that intractable. If we could solve it efficiently we could solve SAT</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:16,000 –&gt; 00:04:21,759<br>efficiently. We don’t think we can solve SAT efficiently. That problem is intractable. That’s our</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:21,759 –&gt; 00:04:27,519<br>meaning of the word intractable. All right so now what are we going to do to classify problems?</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:27,519 –&gt; 00:04:33,279<br>So the first thing is which search problems in P. So there’s no really easy answers for that</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:33,279 –&gt; 00:04:40,560<br>except for devising algorithms. But we do have this reduction technique that is going to help us.</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:41,519 –&gt; 00:04:46,959<br>It’s now we can be a little more general than when we were actually designing algorithms</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:46,959 –&gt; 00:04:53,519<br>they were going to use. And we could have the reduction take polynomial amount of time before</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:53,519 –&gt; 00:04:59,680<br>we’re insisting linear time. And not only that we can take a polynomial number of calls to</p>
<p>41<br>00:05:01,199 –&gt; 00:05:09,279<br>the one that we’re reducing to. And again all of this is about is that if you have a polynomial</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:09,279 –&gt; 00:05:15,599<br>time algorithm for y then the reduction gives you a polynomial time algorithm for x. We’re just</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:15,599 –&gt; 00:05:23,199<br>trying to have the most general definition that preserves that property. And so the consequences</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:23,199 –&gt; 00:05:30,719<br>that if we have a polynomial time reduction from SAT to a given problem y then we can conclude that</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:31,359 –&gt; 00:05:37,919<br>y is well it’s intractable by our definition. That is it’s as difficult as SAT and we think that</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:37,920 –&gt; 00:05:43,680<br>there’s no polynomial time algorithm for it. So that’s the main tool that we’re going to start out with</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:43,680 –&gt; 00:05:54,160<br>to use for classifying problems. So let’s look at an example. So actually you can work with simpler</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:54,160 –&gt; 00:06:00,240<br>versions of SAT. Now you can actually reduce any SAT problem to just the form where you have a</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:00,240 –&gt; 00:06:07,439<br>bunch of equations using literal certain negation connected with ORIES. So usually we use a simpler</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:07,439 –&gt; 00:06:12,879<br>example like that. So given that SAT, given the system of Boolean equations find a solution.</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:14,160 –&gt; 00:06:21,120<br>So now we have another problem, ILP, given a system of linear inequalities find a solution.</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:21,920 –&gt; 00:06:34,959<br>So what we want to do is characterize SAT as an ILP problem. So that is if we had an efficient</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:34,959 –&gt; 00:06:42,639<br>solution to ILP it’d give us a solution to SAT. So let’s take a look at this example. So whatever</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:42,639 –&gt; 00:06:48,799<br>SAT problem we have we put it in this form. And now we’re going to introduce a variable C1</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:50,000 –&gt; 00:06:59,919<br>and for every literal in the SAT problem we’re going to put C1 greater than or equal to</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:00,319 –&gt; 00:07:08,879<br>either the literal if it’s not negated or 1 minus the literal if it is negated. So in this case</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:11,840 –&gt; 00:07:16,960<br>so we have C1 greater than or equal to 1 minus x1 greater than or equal to x3 like that.</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:18,480 –&gt; 00:07:24,400<br>And then we’re going to have a fourth inequality that says that it has to be less than or equal to</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:25,039 –&gt; 00:07:34,239<br>the sum of those three. So what this construction does is if the equation is satisfied,</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:34,239 –&gt; 00:07:41,759<br>if there’s somewhere to satisfy this equation then it’s going to be C1 equals 1.</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:43,279 –&gt; 00:07:52,399<br>So that is if there’s a way to make each one of these terms 1 say by setting x1 to 0,</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:53,359 –&gt; 00:08:02,719<br>x2 to 1 and x3 to 1 then this thing will all be, those things will all be true.</p>
<p>63<br>00:08:04,159 –&gt; 00:08:12,560<br>And then this one also will be true. And all four of these are true if and only if</p>
<p>64<br>00:08:13,359 –&gt; 00:08:20,000<br>the equation is satisfied. And we make a little group like that for all four of the SAT equations.</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:20,959 –&gt; 00:08:29,120<br>And then we do a similar thing with a variable that’s true if and only if all of the C’s are true.</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:29,120 –&gt; 00:08:34,399<br>So this variable has got to be less than or four of these. And the only way that this thing is</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:34,399 –&gt; 00:08:40,879<br>going to be one is if all the equations are satisfied. So this system has a solution.</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:41,759 –&gt; 00:08:47,600<br>If and only if there’s a SAT solution and from the solution this system you can find the SAT</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:47,600 –&gt; 00:08:55,519<br>solution. So that’s a reduction from SAT to integer linear programming. Because of this reduction</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:55,519 –&gt; 00:09:01,360<br>we feel that we don’t we’re not going to have a polynomial time solution to integer linear programming.</p>
<p>71<br>00:09:01,360 –&gt; 00:09:08,159<br>If we did we’d have a fast solution to SAT. So that’s an important piece of knowledge. We</p>
<p>72<br>00:09:08,159 –&gt; 00:09:13,120<br>focus on this one hard problem that we know about and that tells us another problem.</p>
<p>73<br>00:09:13,200 –&gt; 00:09:16,720<br>Is it is the reduction tells us another problem is at least as hard.</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:18,399 –&gt; 00:09:24,080<br>And that by itself is interesting. Intrusting integer linear programming is a very important</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:24,080 –&gt; 00:09:33,279<br>computation with lots of applications. But the amazing thing that was shown by Dick Carp</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:34,240 –&gt; 00:09:45,039<br>in the 70s is that there are lots and lots of problems that you can reduce satisfiability to.</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:46,319 –&gt; 00:09:52,879<br>And actually Carp reduced SAT to the so-called independent set problem and then reduced that</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:52,879 –&gt; 00:09:57,120<br>one to ILP. But if you do two reductions it still works.</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:57,519 –&gt; 00:10:06,399<br>I could solve ILP quickly. I could solve independent set quickly and then I could use that to solve SAT quickly.</p>
<p>80<br>00:10:07,440 –&gt; 00:10:14,159<br>So if you can prove any problem on this set if you can reduce any problem on this set to</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:15,039 –&gt; 00:10:24,480<br>your new problem then that’s like proving that SAT reduces to it. So if we adopt the idea that SAT</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:24,480 –&gt; 00:10:33,120<br>is intractable means all of these problems are intractable. In these are lots of important problems</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:33,120 –&gt; 00:10:39,840<br>that people were looking for solutions and couldn’t find good solutions to. And what Carp</p>
<p>84<br>00:10:39,840 –&gt; 00:10:46,080<br>showed was including traveling salesman problem in so-called Hamilton Path problem which is the</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:46,639 –&gt; 00:10:51,120<br>like probably finding the that’s the problem of finding a path on the graph that visits all the</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:51,120 –&gt; 00:11:01,840<br>vertices. So what Carp showed is that all of these problems are intractable. They’re all at least</p>
<p>87<br>00:11:01,840 –&gt; 00:11:09,120<br>as difficult to SAT as SAT. If we had a efficient, if we had a polynomial of time solution to any one</p>
<p>88<br>00:11:09,120 –&gt; 00:11:18,159<br>of them would have a polynomial of time solution to SAT. That was quite a powerful idea of</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:19,039 –&gt; 00:11:27,439<br>using polynomial time reduction to classify problems in this way. In fact it’s such a powerful idea</p>
<p>90<br>00:11:27,439 –&gt; 00:11:37,679<br>that nowadays there’s maybe 6,000 papers per year with reductions from some problem that has</p>
<p>91<br>00:11:37,679 –&gt; 00:11:46,319<br>been shown to reduce from SAT to some new problem. And these are important problems in all fields of</p>
<p>92<br>00:11:46,320 –&gt; 00:11:53,680<br>a human endeavor. So for example the so-called protein folding problem which in biochemistry</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:54,560 –&gt; 00:12:01,600<br>where people are trying to understand what’s going on in living organisms has been reduced from</p>
<p>94<br>00:12:01,600 –&gt; 00:12:06,720<br>SAT would like to solve that problem. But that would help us understand what’s going on in</p>
<p>95<br>00:12:06,720 –&gt; 00:12:12,800<br>living organisms much better. But if we had an efficient solution for a guaranteed polynomial</p>
<p>96<br>00:12:12,799 –&gt; 00:12:19,039<br>of time solution to that problem would have a guaranteed polynomial of time solution to SAT.</p>
<p>97<br>00:12:19,039 –&gt; 00:12:27,439<br>And so we don’t think so. Or economics with if you just make the arbitrage problem a little more</p>
<p>98<br>00:12:27,439 –&gt; 00:12:35,919<br>complicated and a little more realistic where there’s a little cost involved with doing things turns</p>
<p>99<br>00:12:35,919 –&gt; 00:12:42,799<br>out to be that you can’t have an efficient solution to that one unless because it would imply</p>
<p>100<br>00:12:42,799 –&gt; 00:12:50,079<br>an efficient solution to SAT. In many many other examples of voting power and politics,</p>
<p>101<br>00:12:51,120 –&gt; 00:12:59,519<br>experimental design and statistics, thousands and thousands of papers per year involving reductions</p>
<p>102<br>00:12:59,600 –&gt; 00:13:09,279<br>from SAT. A very very powerful concept that the idea of reducing from SAT. So now we have two ways</p>
<p>103<br>00:13:09,279 –&gt; 00:13:16,639<br>to classify problems. We can find a polynomial time algorithm and then we know problems in P</p>
<p>104<br>00:13:17,600 –&gt; 00:13:26,639<br>or we can develop a polynomial time reduction from SAT. And that’ll prove that at least if you believe</p>
<p>105<br>00:13:26,639 –&gt; 00:13:31,360<br>that SAT is difficult you should believe that it’ll be difficult to find a solution to your problem.</p>
<p>106<br>00:13:32,240 –&gt; 00:13:35,199<br>So that’s the first step in classifying problems.</p>
