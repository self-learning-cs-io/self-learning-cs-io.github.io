                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,439<br>Welcome back. Today we’re going to look at merge sort, which is one of two classic sorting</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,439 –&gt; 00:00:14,000<br>algorithms that are critical components in the world’s computational infrastructure.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,000 –&gt; 00:00:18,160<br>We have a full scientific understanding of the properties of these algorithms, and they’ve</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,160 –&gt; 00:00:23,960<br>been developed as practical system sorts and application sorts that have been heavily</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,960 –&gt; 00:00:29,359<br>used over the past 50 years. In fact, a quick sort, which we’ll consider next time, was</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,359 –&gt; 00:00:35,439<br>honored as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century in science and engineering.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:35,439 –&gt; 00:00:40,960<br>This lecture we’re going to look at merge sort, which is the basic sort in plenty of</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:40,960 –&gt; 00:00:46,760<br>different programming systems, including Java. Next time we’ll look at quick sort, which</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,760 –&gt; 00:00:55,399<br>is also used in Java for different applications. All right, so basic merge sort algorithm,</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:55,399 –&gt; 00:01:00,879<br>what’s it going to look like? The idea is very simple. What we’re going to do is divide</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:00,879 –&gt; 00:01:08,079<br>an array into two halves, recursively sort each of the halves, and then merge the result.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:08,079 –&gt; 00:01:15,640<br>That’s the overview of merge sort. It was actually one of the first non-trivial algorithms</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:15,640 –&gt; 00:01:23,840<br>implemented on a computer. John Von Neumann realized the development of the Edback, his</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:23,840 –&gt; 00:01:28,560<br>Edback computer, one of the first general purpose computers that was going to need a sorting</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:28,560 –&gt; 00:01:33,760<br>method, and he came up with merge sort as widely credited as being the inventor of merge</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:33,760 –&gt; 00:01:44,040<br>sort. The idea of merge sort is based on the idea of merging. To understand how merging</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:44,040 –&gt; 00:01:51,840<br>works, we’ll think about the idea of an abstract in place merge. We’ve got an array A, and</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:51,840 –&gt; 00:01:57,920<br>its first half is sorted, and its second half is sorted. The computation we need to perform</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:57,920 –&gt; 00:02:05,040<br>is to replace that with the sorted array where those two sub halves are merged together.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:05,040 –&gt; 00:02:15,480<br>Let’s look at a demo. The method that we’re going to use is based on taking an auxiliary</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:15,480 –&gt; 00:02:21,560<br>array to hold the data. This is one of the easiest ways to implement the merge. The first</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:21,560 –&gt; 00:02:29,560<br>thing we do is copy everything over to the auxiliary array. Once that’s done, what we’ll</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:29,560 –&gt; 00:02:36,840<br>want to do is copy back to the original array, but get it in sorted order. In order to do</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:36,840 –&gt; 00:02:43,759<br>that, we’re going to maintain three indices. I, the current entry on the left half, j,</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:43,759 –&gt; 00:02:51,480<br>the current entry on the right half, and k, the current entry in the sorted result.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:51,479 –&gt; 00:02:58,479<br>So the first thing we do is take the smaller of the two entries pointed to by i and j,</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:58,479 –&gt; 00:03:06,679<br>and compare those, and take the smallest one, and move that one to be the next item output.</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:06,679 –&gt; 00:03:12,479<br>In whichever one is taken, we increment its pointer. Now we compare the minimum again. Again,</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:12,479 –&gt; 00:03:18,120<br>the one pointed to do by j is smaller, so we move that one to k, increment that pointer</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:18,120 –&gt; 00:03:26,120<br>j, and also increment k. Now there’s two e’s equal. We always take the first, so the one</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:26,120 –&gt; 00:03:35,120<br>in the left array goes to k’s position, and now we increment i and k. And again, it’s an e</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:35,120 –&gt; 00:03:41,120<br>in their equal, but we’ll take the first one, so we move that one up, increment i and k.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:41,120 –&gt; 00:03:47,800<br>Now jz is smaller than g. It’s the next thing that has to go in the output, so we move that</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:47,800 –&gt; 00:03:54,160<br>one up, and increment j and k. Now the one pointed to by i is the g is smaller, so move that</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:54,160 –&gt; 00:04:03,640<br>up, increment i and k. Move the m up, increment i and k. Now the last element in the left</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:03,640 –&gt; 00:04:10,360<br>subarray is the one that’s going to get moved next. And now that first subarray is exhausted,</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:10,360 –&gt; 00:04:15,360<br>so really all we need to do is take the rest of the elements from the right part and move</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:15,360 –&gt; 00:04:23,080<br>them back in. Actually, since we copied, we could optimize by avoiding these moves. That’s</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:23,080 –&gt; 00:04:31,480<br>an abstract in place merge for taking the two sorted sub halves of an array, using an auxiliary</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:31,480 –&gt; 00:04:36,520<br>array, move them out, and then put them back in in sorted order. All right, so here’s the</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:36,520 –&gt; 00:04:45,319<br>code for merging, which is quite straightforward from the demo. We first, in order to</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:45,319 –&gt; 00:04:54,680<br>sort an array of comparable, in a simple notation, we pass a link to the auxiliary array in</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:54,680 –&gt; 00:05:01,279<br>as well. And we have three arguments, low, mid, and high, so low is the first part of the</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:01,279 –&gt; 00:05:08,519<br>array to be sorted, mids the midpoint, that divides the first part from the second, so our</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:08,519 –&gt; 00:05:15,519<br>conditions are that from low to mid is sorted and from mid plus one to high is sorted. So the</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:15,519 –&gt; 00:05:20,159<br>merge implementation, then the first thing it does is copy everything over to the auxiliary</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:20,159 –&gt; 00:05:27,959<br>array. And then that sets up for this for loop that accomplishes the merge. We start our</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:27,959 –&gt; 00:05:33,079<br>i pointer at the left part of the left half, the j pointer at the left part of the right</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:33,079 –&gt; 00:05:38,959<br>half, that’s mid plus one, and we start the k pointer at the beginning low. And for every</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:38,959 –&gt; 00:05:51,079<br>value of k, what we’re most often doing is comparing whether ox of j is less than ox of i. And if</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:51,079 –&gt; 00:05:59,000<br>it is, we move the element at j over an increment j. If it’s greater, we move the element i over</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:59,000 –&gt; 00:06:05,120<br>an increment i, and then in both cases we’re increment a, that increment k and that</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:05,120 –&gt; 00:06:11,600<br>implements the merge. If the i pointer is exhausted, then we just move over the next j</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:11,600 –&gt; 00:06:18,439<br>element, if the j pointer is exhausted, we move over the next i element. So every time we’re</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:18,439 –&gt; 00:06:25,480<br>moving a new element into k, and that’s the code that implements the abstract in place merge.</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:25,480 –&gt; 00:06:34,840<br>Now, with this code, we’re also introducing the idea of making assertions just to make it easier</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:34,840 –&gt; 00:06:42,600<br>to debug in our code and to have confidence that it’s correct. In this case, this insertion</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:42,600 –&gt; 00:06:52,840<br>just says we want to be sure that a of load of mid is sorted and that mid plus one to high is sorted</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:53,239 –&gt; 00:07:00,119<br>before our code. And then we want to check that the whole thing is sorted after our code. In</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:00,119 –&gt; 00:07:07,799<br>generally programmers, Java programmers know that it’s a good idea to try to do these assertions.</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:09,159 –&gt; 00:07:14,039<br>Not only does it help detect bugs, but it also documents what the code is supposed to do. And</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:14,039 –&gt; 00:07:19,159<br>that merge code is a good example of this. If you put it at the beginning of the code, what you</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:19,160 –&gt; 00:07:25,400<br>expect in the form of an assertion, which is code itself, and you put it at the end of the code,</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:25,400 –&gt; 00:07:30,120<br>what you think it’s going to do, again, in the form of an assertion. You’re both testing that</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:30,120 –&gt; 00:07:35,160<br>these conditions hold and also telling someone reading the code what you’re trying to do with it.</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:36,840 –&gt; 00:07:44,200<br>So Java is just an assert statement. It takes a Boolean condition. In this case, we’re using that</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:44,199 –&gt; 00:07:51,000<br>method is sorted that we wrote before. That returns true if the port of the array is sorted and false</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:51,000 –&gt; 00:07:57,800<br>if it’s not. And what assert will do is it’ll throw an exception unless that condition is true.</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:58,839 –&gt; 00:08:03,560<br>Now the thing about assertions in Java is that you can enable or disable them at runtime.</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:04,439 –&gt; 00:08:10,039<br>And that’s really important because it means that you can put them into your code to check</p>
<p>71<br>00:08:10,040 –&gt; 00:08:17,879<br>while developing, but it doesn’t incur any extra costs at all in production code. So by default,</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:17,879 –&gt; 00:08:25,879<br>assertions are disabled. Something goes wrong. Somebody analyzing the situation can enable insertions.</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:26,439 –&gt; 00:08:34,600<br>And they often will help find out what the problem is. So the best practice is to use insertions</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:34,680 –&gt; 00:08:41,000<br>just as we did in that example with merge and to assume that they’re not going to be there in</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:41,000 –&gt; 00:08:45,800<br>production code. So you shouldn’t use them for things like checking if the input is the way you like it.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:48,040 –&gt; 00:08:54,040<br>All right, so with that merge implementation, then the sort implementation is a quite simple</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:54,040 –&gt; 00:09:01,800<br>recursive procedure shown here. So we use the merge procedure we just showed. And then our sort</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:01,799 –&gt; 00:09:08,839<br>procedure is recursive. So checks that we have something to do first. And it computes the value</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:08,839 –&gt; 00:09:16,279<br>of the midpoint, the same way as we did for binary search, sort the first half, sort the second half,</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:16,279 –&gt; 00:09:24,679<br>and then merge them together. And then the actual sort is takes just the one argument of the array,</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:25,479 –&gt; 00:09:34,359<br>creates the auxiliary array and then uses that. Now it’s important to not create the auxiliary array</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:34,359 –&gt; 00:09:42,759<br>in the recursive routine because that could lead to extensive cost of extra array creation.</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:43,479 –&gt; 00:09:49,159<br>You’ll sometimes see merge sort performing poorly because of that bug. Otherwise,</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:50,120 –&gt; 00:09:56,839<br>this is a very straightforward implementation. And it’s actually a prototype for algorithm design</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:56,839 –&gt; 00:10:02,120<br>that we’ll see come up again again. It’s called dividing conquer. Solve a problem by dividing</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:02,120 –&gt; 00:10:07,399<br>in a two halves, solving the two halves, and then putting the solutions together to get an appropriate answer.</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:11,399 –&gt; 00:10:16,839<br>Here’s a trace of what merge sort does. And if you haven’t studied a recursive program before,</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:17,560 –&gt; 00:10:26,360<br>it’s worthwhile studying this thing in some detail. This gives exactly what happens during</p>
<p>89<br>00:10:26,360 –&gt; 00:10:31,639<br>each of the calls to merge. We start out with a big problem to solve, but we divide it in half,</p>
<p>90<br>00:10:31,639 –&gt; 00:10:35,639<br>then we divide that one in half, and then we divide that one in half. And the very first thing</p>
<p>91<br>00:10:35,639 –&gt; 00:10:41,400<br>that we actually do is just compare and exchange if necessary the first two elements. And then we</p>
<p>92<br>00:10:41,480 –&gt; 00:10:47,319<br>do the same thing for the next two elements, then merge those two together to get the first four done.</p>
<p>93<br>00:10:47,959 –&gt; 00:10:52,360<br>Then we do the same thing for the next four in the array. So now we have two sorted sub-raises</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:52,360 –&gt; 00:10:57,480<br>in size four. We merge those together to get one of size eight. And then we do the same thing on</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:57,480 –&gt; 00:11:02,519<br>the right. And eventually we have two eighths that we merge together to get the final result.</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:03,159 –&gt; 00:11:09,879<br>Very instructive to study this trace to really understand what this recursive algorithm is doing.</p>
<p>97<br>00:11:11,399 –&gt; 00:11:16,199<br>So now we can animate, and again merge sorts more efficient so we can do more and more items.</p>
<p>98<br>00:11:18,199 –&gt; 00:11:22,919<br>You can see it’s got the first half sorted. Now it’s working on the second half.</p>
<p>99<br>00:11:24,039 –&gt; 00:11:27,720<br>And then once it gets the second half sorted, then it’s going to go ahead and merge them right</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:27,720 –&gt; 00:11:35,879<br>together to get the sorted result. And it’s got a little extra dynamics in the animation because</p>
<p>101<br>00:11:35,879 –&gt; 00:11:41,000<br>of the auxiliary array. Let’s look at it when it’s in reverse order.</p>
<p>102<br>00:11:43,639 –&gt; 00:11:47,159<br>Again, it gets the first half done. Now it’s working on the second half.</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:49,399 –&gt; 00:11:53,240<br>Once it gets the second half done, then it goes ahead and merges together the whole thing.</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:54,120 –&gt; 00:11:58,200<br>It’s just as fast and reverse sorted as in arbitrary order.</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:58,200 –&gt; 00:12:07,160<br>So you can run merge sort on huge problems. It’s a very efficient algorithm.</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:07,160 –&gt; 00:12:16,520<br>And so for example, what this table shows, if you were to try to use insertion sort for a huge file,</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:16,520 –&gt; 00:12:21,800<br>say a file of a billion elements on your PC, it’d take a few centuries to finish.</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:22,279 –&gt; 00:12:29,639<br>Even on a supercomputer, if you’re using insertion sort nowadays, it may be take a week or more.</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:30,199 –&gt; 00:12:34,519<br>But if you have a good algorithm like merge sort and you’re trying to do a billion items,</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:34,519 –&gt; 00:12:41,959<br>you can do it in just less than half an hour on your PC. And a supercomputer can do it in an</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:41,959 –&gt; 00:12:48,599<br>instant. And smaller problems only take an instant even on your PC. So you can spend a lot of money</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:49,240 –&gt; 00:12:55,879<br>or a lot of time or you can use a good algorithm. And that’s one of our main themes in this course.</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:56,680 –&gt; 00:13:03,159<br>A good algorithm is much more effective than spending one of your time wasting one of your time</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:03,159 –&gt; 00:13:11,960<br>using a bad one. So let’s look at the analysis of merge sort. That’s a bit of math but very</p>
<p>115<br>00:13:11,960 –&gt; 00:13:20,200<br>instructive because this really shows the power of the divide and conquer method,</p>
<p>116<br>00:13:21,000 –&gt; 00:13:27,560<br>and allow us to take a problem that was taking us quadratic time with methods like insertion</p>
<p>117<br>00:13:27,560 –&gt; 00:13:34,680<br>and selection sort and get it done in n log n time with merge sort. So that’s the proposition.</p>
<p>118<br>00:13:34,680 –&gt; 00:13:41,080<br>Merge sort uses that most n log n compares and 6a n log n array accesses to sort any array of size n.</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:42,200 –&gt; 00:13:51,160<br>And the way to prove this proposition is to from examining the code to write down what’s</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:51,160 –&gt; 00:13:57,800<br>called recurrence relation. And all that is it’s a mathematical reflection of what’s going on in</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:57,800 –&gt; 00:14:06,200<br>the code. If we’re sorting n items then let’s see a van denote the number of compares that we need</p>
<p>122<br>00:14:06,200 –&gt; 00:14:12,120<br>to sort the n items. In order to get that done we’re sorting the left half and the right half.</p>
<p>123<br>00:14:13,400 –&gt; 00:14:20,840<br>And there’s notation ceiling of n over 2 and floor of n over 2. That’s the n over 2 round up and</p>
<p>124<br>00:14:20,840 –&gt; 00:14:26,920<br>over 2 round down. Now that’s the size of the two sub arrays. And we’re going to call the same routine</p>
<p>125<br>00:14:26,920 –&gt; 00:14:31,160<br>for that size. So the number of compares you need for that is c of n over 2.</p>
<p>126<br>00:14:32,120 –&gt; 00:14:36,919<br>ceiling of n over 2 for the left and c of floor of n over 2 for the right. And then for the merge</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:36,919 –&gt; 00:14:45,319<br>we need at least at most n compares. If neither one exhaust we need exactly n compares.</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:45,799 –&gt; 00:14:50,679<br>And so in that’s true as long as n’s bigger than one if there’s only one thing we’re not doing</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:50,679 –&gt; 00:14:57,639<br>any compares at all. So this is a mathematical formula that we derive by examining the code.</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:58,600 –&gt; 00:15:05,319<br>But it completely describes mathematically what we an upper bound on the number of compares</p>
<p>131<br>00:15:05,319 –&gt; 00:15:10,840<br>that are going to be needed. And similarly for the number of array accesses if you count up the</p>
<p>132<br>00:15:10,840 –&gt; 00:15:17,799<br>number of times you’re accessing an array for a merge it could be at most 6 n. So these are</p>
<p>133<br>00:15:17,799 –&gt; 00:15:23,720<br>mathematical formulas and there’s techniques for solving them and we won’t go into that. This is</p>
<p>134<br>00:15:23,720 –&gt; 00:15:32,680<br>not a course in discrete mathematics. But what we can do is show how to solve the recurrence when</p>
<p>135<br>00:15:32,680 –&gt; 00:15:38,120<br>n is a power of 2. And then it turns out that it holds for all n which we can prove by induction</p>
<p>136<br>00:15:38,120 –&gt; 00:15:47,320<br>from the recurrence. So if you have this recurrence which is similar to the ones that we’re talking</p>
<p>137<br>00:15:47,320 –&gt; 00:15:54,040<br>about it’s exactly the same one n is a power of 2. Let’s let’s look at this one. If d of n is</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:54,040 –&gt; 00:16:01,240<br>2 d of n over 2 plus n with d of 1 equals 0 then d of n equals n log n. And we’ll look at three</p>
<p>139<br>00:16:01,240 –&gt; 00:16:07,960<br>proofs of that just assuming that n is a power of 2. If n is a power of 2 then n over 2 is also a</p>
<p>140<br>00:16:07,960 –&gt; 00:16:15,560<br>power of 2 so the recurrence makes sense. So this is just a graphical representation. If we want to</p>
<p>141<br>00:16:15,559 –&gt; 00:16:24,679<br>compute d of n we want to compute d of n over 2 twice. So that’s 2. And then the extra cost for</p>
<p>142<br>00:16:24,679 –&gt; 00:16:33,319<br>the merge is n. But if we’re going to do this twice then we have 2 n over 2. We have 2 n over 2.</p>
<p>143<br>00:16:34,119 –&gt; 00:16:40,839<br>And then for each one of these we have divided into n over 4s and each one of those 4 n over 4s</p>
<p>144<br>00:16:40,840 –&gt; 00:16:47,639<br>has an extra cost for the merge of n over 4. Well 2 over 2 is n, 4 over 4 is n. And we keep going</p>
<p>145<br>00:16:47,639 –&gt; 00:16:53,800<br>down doing that till we get down to d of 2. And we always for the extra cost of the merge we have n.</p>
<p>146<br>00:16:54,519 –&gt; 00:16:59,879<br>And how many stages do we have here? Well it’s the number of times you divide n by 2 to get</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:59,879 –&gt; 00:17:06,039<br>down to 2. That’s exactly the log base 2 of n. So the grand total of all the costs for the merge</p>
<p>148<br>00:17:06,200 –&gt; 00:17:13,399<br>which is where the compares are is log n times n and log n. It’s kind of a graphical proof or</p>
<p>149<br>00:17:13,399 –&gt; 00:17:20,599<br>proof by picture that recurrence has that solution. Here’s a little bit more mathematical one.</p>
<p>150<br>00:17:21,879 –&gt; 00:17:28,759<br>We write the recurrence down and then we divide both sides by n.</p>
<p>151<br>00:17:29,079 –&gt; 00:17:39,799<br>So then it says d of n over n equals d of n over 2 over n over 2 plus 1. So it’s dividing by n.</p>
<p>152<br>00:17:40,440 –&gt; 00:17:47,400<br>So now this is a recurrence that telescopes. The first term on the right hand side is exactly the</p>
<p>153<br>00:17:47,400 –&gt; 00:17:53,559<br>same as the left hand side. So we can apply the same formula. And all it does is divides by 2</p>
<p>154<br>00:17:53,559 –&gt; 00:17:59,639<br>again and then throws out another one. And we keep doing that until we get down to d of 1 which is</p>
<p>155<br>00:17:59,639 –&gt; 00:18:07,240<br>0. And when we’ve done that we’ve thrown out log n ones. So we get d of n over n equals log n or d</p>
<p>156<br>00:18:07,240 –&gt; 00:18:16,919<br>of n equals n log n. That’s another proof by expansion. Or using either one of those techniques you</p>
<p>157<br>00:18:16,920 –&gt; 00:18:26,360<br>could just get the idea that d of n is close to n log n. Or you can write a program to</p>
<p>158<br>00:18:26,360 –&gt; 00:18:35,000<br>expand the recurrence and find that. And then once we have the idea that d of n equals n log n</p>
<p>159<br>00:18:35,000 –&gt; 00:18:43,080<br>we can plug back into the original formula with the inductive hypothesis that d of n equals n log</p>
<p>160<br>00:18:43,720 –&gt; 00:18:50,679<br>we want to show that d of 2n equals 2n log 2n. Using the recurrence d of 2n equals 2d of n plus</p>
<p>161<br>00:18:50,679 –&gt; 00:18:59,000<br>throughout the 2n. Plugging in n log n we get the desired result. You use this same idea on our</p>
<p>162<br>00:18:59,000 –&gt; 00:19:06,359<br>initial recurrences for compares and array accesses to show that the running the number of compares</p>
<p>163<br>00:19:06,359 –&gt; 00:19:12,919<br>and array accesses proportional to n log n for merge sort. So that’s the running time. Merge sort</p>
<p>164<br>00:19:12,919 –&gt; 00:19:20,439<br>is fast. The other thing that we usually want to know is memory. And one of merge sort’s characteristics</p>
<p>165<br>00:19:20,439 –&gt; 00:19:27,000<br>is that in practical applications it uses extra space proportional to n. That is we need that</p>
<p>166<br>00:19:27,000 –&gt; 00:19:33,639<br>extra auxiliary array for the last merge. We took two sorted sub arrays and we talked about an</p>
<p>167<br>00:19:33,640 –&gt; 00:19:39,080<br>abstract in place merge but we didn’t have an actual in place merge. We were using an extra sub</p>
<p>168<br>00:19:39,080 –&gt; 00:19:47,880<br>array. So in place is important. A lot of times we’re sorting everything we have. We want to</p>
<p>169<br>00:19:47,880 –&gt; 00:19:54,280<br>fill up the memory with stuff to sort and then sort it. In search and selection and shell sort</p>
<p>170<br>00:19:54,280 –&gt; 00:20:00,200<br>in place then we use much extra memory. Of a merge sort you can only sort really half of what</p>
<p>171<br>00:20:00,200 –&gt; 00:20:07,000<br>you can fit in memory because you need that auxiliary array for the other half. If you want again</p>
<p>172<br>00:20:07,000 –&gt; 00:20:11,960<br>if you think that the things we’re studying are easy think about the idea of actually doing an</p>
<p>173<br>00:20:11,960 –&gt; 00:20:18,519<br>in place merge. People have come up with methods for getting this done so it’s theoretically possible</p>
<p>174<br>00:20:18,519 –&gt; 00:20:24,200<br>but the methods are generally too complex to be useful in practice and they’re not used</p>
<p>175<br>00:20:24,200 –&gt; 00:20:29,799<br>but there could be out there some easy way to do an in place merge. That’s another great algorithm</p>
<p>176<br>00:20:29,799 –&gt; 00:20:35,799<br>waiting to be discovered. Now there’s a number of practical improvements that we can use to make</p>
<p>177<br>00:20:35,799 –&gt; 00:20:41,879<br>merge sort even more efficient than the simple one that we’ve looked at. We’ll take a look at those</p>
<p>178<br>00:20:41,879 –&gt; 00:20:49,319<br>because there are examples of techniques that we can use for other algorithms. First thing is that</p>
<p>179<br>00:20:49,319 –&gt; 00:20:55,720<br>merge sort is too complicated to use for tiny arrays. So say the sub arrays are only of size 2</p>
<p>180<br>00:20:56,519 –&gt; 00:21:02,519<br>or 3 or 4. There’s too much overhead with the recursive calls and so forth to get that done</p>
<p>181<br>00:21:02,519 –&gt; 00:21:10,440<br>efficiently and what’s worse is the recursive nature of the sort definitely means that there’s</p>
<p>182<br>00:21:10,440 –&gt; 00:21:16,519<br>going to be lots of sub arrays to be sorted. So one improvement that we can make is to use insertion</p>
<p>183<br>00:21:16,519 –&gt; 00:21:22,360<br>sort and just cut off and use insertion sort which is simple and efficient for small sub arrays.</p>
<p>184<br>00:21:22,359 –&gt; 00:21:27,719<br>So that’s adding this one line of code to merge sort. We’ll make it quite a bit faster, maybe 20%</p>
<p>185<br>00:21:27,719 –&gt; 00:21:34,279<br>faster. A second improvement that we can make that’ll improve the performance for cases when</p>
<p>186<br>00:21:35,000 –&gt; 00:21:41,879<br>the array is partly sorted. This should just stop if it’s already sorted and that’s going to happen</p>
<p>187<br>00:21:41,879 –&gt; 00:21:46,599<br>in the case where the biggest element in the first half is less than or equal to small side</p>
<p>188<br>00:21:46,599 –&gt; 00:21:53,079<br>in the second half. That means it’s done. So that’s easy. We just put a test in the recursive merge</p>
<p>189<br>00:21:53,079 –&gt; 00:21:59,559<br>sort for that to this one line of code to check whether we’re done. Now that way, for example, if you</p>
<p>190<br>00:21:59,559 –&gt; 00:22:07,000<br>were to call merge sort for an array that’s already in order, it would just do this test every time</p>
<p>191<br>00:22:07,639 –&gt; 00:22:13,799<br>and it would be done in linear time. That’s pretty helpful although not totally helpful but there’s</p>
<p>192<br>00:22:13,799 –&gt; 00:22:21,079<br>a lot of situations where that’s helpful. The other thing that’s possible to do in it’s a little</p>
<p>193<br>00:22:21,079 –&gt; 00:22:29,639<br>mind bending so the recommended only for experts is to save a little bit of time. You don’t really</p>
<p>194<br>00:22:29,639 –&gt; 00:22:36,839<br>have to copy over into the auxiliary array. You can kind of switch the role of the input in the</p>
<p>195<br>00:22:36,839 –&gt; 00:22:43,639<br>auxiliary array every time you make a recursive call. You still need that array but you can set</p>
<p>196<br>00:22:43,640 –&gt; 00:22:53,000<br>up the code in this way which to sort an array put the result in the other one to merge an array</p>
<p>197<br>00:22:53,000 –&gt; 00:22:59,800<br>put the result back in the first one. So it’s a recursive argument switchery to get the job done</p>
<p>198<br>00:22:59,800 –&gt; 00:23:05,080<br>and it’s effective. It means you don’t have to actually move items and that saves a little bit of time.</p>
<p>199<br>00:23:05,079 –&gt; 00:23:14,359<br>So here’s a visualization of what the practical merge sort might look like and this is with</p>
<p>200<br>00:23:15,079 –&gt; 00:23:24,599<br>big cut off to small sub files. So you get a visual feeling of how this sort gets the job done.</p>
<p>201<br>00:23:25,240 –&gt; 00:23:30,279<br>That’s the first little chunk and then the next little chunk and then merges us together and</p>
<p>202<br>00:23:30,279 –&gt; 00:23:36,839<br>so forth and so on. A good visual representation of how merge sort gets its job done.</p>
<p>203<br>00:23:37,720 –&gt; 00:23:46,200<br>That’s the basic merge sort algorithm that we’re going to look at different versions of the next.</p>
