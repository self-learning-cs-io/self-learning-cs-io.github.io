                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,000<br>Now we’ll look at an interesting application of priority cues that’s actually representative</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,000 –&gt; 00:00:14,240<br>of a whole family of critically important applications in applications of computing.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,240 –&gt; 00:00:18,199<br>It’s called event driven simulation.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,199 –&gt; 00:00:25,800<br>And the idea is we want to study some property of the natural world by simulating it.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:25,800 –&gt; 00:00:32,359<br>And that’s something that’s very, very common in scientific inquiry nowadays.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:32,359 –&gt; 00:00:35,600<br>And this is a very natural idea.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:35,600 –&gt; 00:00:40,039<br>Actually, the idea goes back to Einstein.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:40,039 –&gt; 00:00:47,519<br>So we want to simulate the motion of in-moving particles that might collide with a priority</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:47,519 –&gt; 00:00:53,079<br>– this kind of simulation is enabled by priority cues.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:53,079 –&gt; 00:00:58,759<br>Without something like priority cues, you couldn’t do this for a large number of particles</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:58,759 –&gt; 00:01:04,840<br>because it would require quadratic time and simply can’t be afforded for a huge number</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:04,840 –&gt; 00:01:06,640<br>of particles.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:06,640 –&gt; 00:01:12,319<br>So let’s take a look at how we can possibly make this happen.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:12,319 –&gt; 00:01:17,840<br>So we use a simple scientific model called the hard disk model.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:17,840 –&gt; 00:01:22,799<br>And then this is just first simplicity to get this done and just part of a lecture.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:22,799 –&gt; 00:01:26,560<br>Clearly, these things can be extended in many ways.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:26,560 –&gt; 00:01:30,560<br>So we’re going to have moving particles that either collide with each other and with the</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:30,560 –&gt; 00:01:32,040<br>walls.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:32,040 –&gt; 00:01:37,800<br>And each particle is a disk that’s got known position, velocity, mass, and radius.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:37,800 –&gt; 00:01:39,640<br>And there’s no other forces involved.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:39,640 –&gt; 00:01:45,200<br>It gets more complicated if there’s more forces, like gravity involved.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:45,200 –&gt; 00:01:48,799<br>And this one by itself is very significant.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:48,799 –&gt; 00:01:57,640<br>As I mentioned, goes back to a study of physics with trying to understand pressure and temperature</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:57,640 –&gt; 00:02:04,719<br>in Einstein’s famous experiment on pollen grains showing that their motion was browning</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:04,719 –&gt; 00:02:06,520<br>in a random.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:06,520 –&gt; 00:02:13,159<br>So whether it’s individual atoms and molecules or it’s some bigger kinds of particles, it’s</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:13,159 –&gt; 00:02:20,240<br>a complex dynamic situation that is better understood through computer simulation.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:20,240 –&gt; 00:02:26,319<br>And nowadays, that means priority cues.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:26,319 –&gt; 00:02:34,719<br>So as a warm-up, here’s the code to implement bouncing balls without the collisions.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:34,719 –&gt; 00:02:44,079<br>And this is an elementary programming exercise that is the code at the left has the effect</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:44,079 –&gt; 00:02:46,319<br>shown at the right.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:46,319 –&gt; 00:02:56,240<br>So we have a data type called ball that represents just one of the particles and has instance</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:56,240 –&gt; 00:03:00,360<br>variables that has the position in the velocity.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:00,360 –&gt; 00:03:02,400<br>So we make a bunch of them.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:02,400 –&gt; 00:03:10,720<br>And then we have a wild loop, which is just every 50 milliseconds.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:10,720 –&gt; 00:03:18,560<br>Clear the whole drawing and then move the balls a little bit and then draw them in their</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:18,560 –&gt; 00:03:19,560<br>current position.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:20,280 –&gt; 00:03:32,280<br>The only thing that moves operation does is to update the position of the ball by the velocity,</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:32,280 –&gt; 00:03:34,360<br>which is just another number.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:34,360 –&gt; 00:03:36,319<br>And then it does the bouncing off the walls.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:36,319 –&gt; 00:03:42,879<br>If it happens to hit the left wall, you reflect the x coordinate and the right wall.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:42,879 –&gt; 00:03:44,680<br>Reflect the x coordinate and bottom and top.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:44,680 –&gt; 00:03:47,159<br>You do the same for the y coordinates.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:47,159 –&gt; 00:03:53,680<br>So this is an easy programming exercise given the right display primitives.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:53,680 –&gt; 00:04:01,079<br>And it’s a good exercise in object or error programming showing how just one implementation,</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:01,079 –&gt; 00:04:06,240<br>then we can use that same implementation to simulate a number of instances.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:06,240 –&gt; 00:04:10,400<br>So that’s our starting point in terms of the code.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:10,400 –&gt; 00:04:15,240<br>So this is the implementation of the ball class.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:15,240 –&gt; 00:04:22,079<br>So it’s got position and velocity, as I mentioned, and every ball has a radius.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:22,079 –&gt; 00:04:25,800<br>And then there’s a constructor and maybe we have a constructor that takes arguments that</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:25,800 –&gt; 00:04:30,879<br>would initialize the position and the velocity, or maybe initialize them to random position</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:30,879 –&gt; 00:04:32,840<br>if there’s no arguments.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:32,840 –&gt; 00:04:35,360<br>And then here’s the move method.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:35,360 –&gt; 00:04:41,759<br>And the move method, again, most of the times just takes the x and y coordinates and adds</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:41,759 –&gt; 00:04:49,040<br>the current velocity times the speed constant, dt, or speed variable that’s given as argument</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:49,040 –&gt; 00:04:50,639<br>dt.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:50,639 –&gt; 00:04:54,639<br>And then these tests are for whether it hits the walls, in which case you have to flip</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:54,639 –&gt; 00:04:58,160<br>the x or y velocity.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:58,160 –&gt; 00:05:02,280<br>And then draw is just using standard draw, just draw the ball.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:02,279 –&gt; 00:05:07,639<br>So that’s all the code for doing the bouncing ball simulation.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:07,639 –&gt; 00:05:13,759<br>Now what’s missing in this is what happens when the balls collide with each other.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:13,759 –&gt; 00:05:22,519<br>And to cope with that, we need to do both a little bit of high school physics and a little</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:22,519 –&gt; 00:05:24,879<br>bit of basic computer science.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:24,879 –&gt; 00:05:29,079<br>So the physics problem is exactly what happens when two balls hit and they bounce off each</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:29,079 –&gt; 00:05:33,719<br>other according to some well understood physical process.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:33,719 –&gt; 00:05:35,680<br>And that’s the high school physics.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:35,680 –&gt; 00:05:42,639<br>And the CS problem is how and when do we exactly do these computations for each of the balls?</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:42,639 –&gt; 00:05:45,560<br>And how can we do it efficiently?</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:45,560 –&gt; 00:05:50,319<br>That is in log n time versus quadratic time.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:50,319 –&gt; 00:05:54,839<br>Because if we have a computational process that takes quadratic time, then it’s not going</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:54,839 –&gt; 00:05:55,839<br>to scale.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:55,839 –&gt; 00:05:58,759<br>We’re not going to be able to do large numbers of particles.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:58,759 –&gt; 00:06:04,199<br>Simulations of the real world usually we wind up doing huge amounts of data and we cannot</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:04,199 –&gt; 00:06:06,360<br>have a quadratic algorithm.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:06,360 –&gt; 00:06:10,439<br>This is just a first indication of that.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:10,439 –&gt; 00:06:15,039<br>Why if you want to do this simulation, you better know about some data structure like</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:15,039 –&gt; 00:06:16,439<br>prior to cues.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:16,439 –&gt; 00:06:20,240<br>If you try to do it without it, you’re not going to be successful.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:20,240 –&gt; 00:06:23,680<br>All right, so let’s take a look at what happens.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:23,680 –&gt; 00:06:28,480<br>So there’s a number of things that you might consider trying.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:28,480 –&gt; 00:06:33,520<br>So one idea is a so-called time driven simulation.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:33,520 –&gt; 00:06:40,240<br>And we just say we’re going to update everything every DT seconds.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:40,240 –&gt; 00:06:42,360<br>Then we go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:42,360 –&gt; 00:06:46,040<br>And then we could check if there’s a collision.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:46,040 –&gt; 00:06:50,840<br>If the two balls, some pieces of two balls are occupying the same space.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:50,840 –&gt; 00:06:56,080<br>And if there is, then we could roll back time just a little bit and try to figure out exactly</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:56,079 –&gt; 00:07:00,879<br>the moment at which they collided and then figure out how their position of velocity should</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:00,879 –&gt; 00:07:04,839<br>change accordingly and then continue the simulation.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:04,839 –&gt; 00:07:07,079<br>But this has a huge problem.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:07,079 –&gt; 00:07:11,759<br>The first one is that you have to check all pairs of balls for overlap.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:11,759 –&gt; 00:07:13,039<br>So that’s quadratic.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:13,039 –&gt; 00:07:16,839<br>So it’s going to be really a lot of overall.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:16,839 –&gt; 00:07:21,159<br>It actually not going to be able to do it for a huge value of n.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:21,160 –&gt; 00:07:29,960<br>But the other thing is even if n is small, if you do a very small DT, then you’re just doing</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:29,960 –&gt; 00:07:31,640<br>this calculation over and over again.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:31,640 –&gt; 00:07:37,240<br>And there’s just too much computation moving the balls a little bit at a time.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:37,240 –&gt; 00:07:43,480<br>On the other hand, if you try and prove things by making DT too large, you might completely</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:43,480 –&gt; 00:07:47,360<br>miss a collision as shown in the example at right.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:47,360 –&gt; 00:07:54,160<br>So figuring out the value of DT that would really work is a huge problem for the time driven</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:54,160 –&gt; 00:07:55,879<br>simulation.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:55,879 –&gt; 00:08:01,080<br>Instead, what we want to do is a called an event driven simulation.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:01,080 –&gt; 00:08:05,800<br>And this is a very general concept that’s useful in all kinds of contexts.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:05,800 –&gt; 00:08:09,000<br>And we’re only going to change things when something happens.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:09,000 –&gt; 00:08:14,520<br>So since the only thing that matters is collisions, we’re going to figure that particles move</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:14,519 –&gt; 00:08:17,319<br>in a straight line between collisions.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:17,319 –&gt; 00:08:22,839<br>And what we’re going to do is focus only on the times when the collisions are going to occur.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:22,839 –&gt; 00:08:27,159<br>And so the way we’re going to do that is to maintain a priority queue.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:27,159 –&gt; 00:08:32,519<br>And that priority queue is going to have all the possible collisions that could happen in the future.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:32,519 –&gt; 00:08:35,079<br>And they’re going to be prioritized by time.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:35,079 –&gt; 00:08:42,120<br>And when we remove the minimum element from the priority queue, that’s the next collision that we have to deal with.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:42,120 –&gt; 00:08:44,519<br>And so we have two phases.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:44,519 –&gt; 00:08:46,799<br>We have prediction and resolution.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:46,799 –&gt; 00:08:51,759<br>So at some time, we can take two particles.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:51,759 –&gt; 00:08:55,240<br>We know their position and velocity is shown at the bottom here.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:55,240 –&gt; 00:09:06,399<br>And we can predict exactly the moment which they’ll collide, assuming that something else doesn’t happen to them in between.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:06,399 –&gt; 00:09:12,080<br>And then so then we’ll put that predicted collision time on the priority queue.</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:12,080 –&gt; 00:09:21,080<br>And later on, when that time comes to pass, we’ll be right at the moment when they collide and we can figure out what to do.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:21,080 –&gt; 00:09:26,879<br>Now there is a possibility that something else happened to them in between and we’ll talk about that change too.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:26,879 –&gt; 00:09:31,800<br>So we have to do collision prediction, which is given position velocity and radius.</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:31,800 –&gt; 00:09:36,040<br>When’s it going to hit with another particle or the wall?</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:36,039 –&gt; 00:09:47,039<br>And then there’s resolution, which is to figure out how to change the velocities of the particles according to physical laws.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:47,039 –&gt; 00:09:56,919<br>Now, this part, I’m not going to talk about in that much detail right now because it’s high school physics.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:56,919 –&gt; 00:10:10,079<br>So I think most students have had some high school physics and be able to do this math or at least be convinced that the code that does this math is correct.</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:10,079 –&gt; 00:10:21,879<br>So if you know that you have a particle that’s at a certain position or X, R, Y, and it’s got a certain velocity, VX in the X direction, VY in the Y direction.</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:21,879 –&gt; 00:10:32,039<br>Then from the distance to the vertical wall, you can figure out how many seconds it’s going to take until it hits it.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:32,039 –&gt; 00:10:37,439<br>It’s basically that distance divided by the velocity.</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:37,439 –&gt; 00:10:39,879<br>And so that’s the prediction.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:39,879 –&gt; 00:10:46,600<br>And then the resolution when it hits the wall is just going to change the velocity.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:46,600 –&gt; 00:10:50,879<br>So you know what the position is.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:50,879 –&gt; 00:10:55,240<br>So that’s just an example of collision prediction.</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:55,240 –&gt; 00:11:00,720<br>When’s it going to hit the wall and resolution what do you do when it gets to the wall?</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:00,720 –&gt; 00:11:05,000<br>When you have two particles, there’s definitely more math.</p>
<p>133<br>00:11:05,000 –&gt; 00:11:07,840<br>And again, this is high school physics.</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:07,840 –&gt; 00:11:13,600<br>And we’re not going to test on it or even go through the details.</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:13,600 –&gt; 00:11:27,639<br>But it’s just a little bit of arithmetic with the velocities and the positions to deal with what happens when how to predict when a given particle is going to collide with another given particle knowing their velocity and position.</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:27,639 –&gt; 00:11:34,200<br>So you have to take both velocities and divide their distance by those and so forth.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:34,200 –&gt; 00:11:39,200<br>So there’s simple formulas to tell us what to do.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:39,200 –&gt; 00:11:45,840<br>And we can also figure out the formulas for what we do once they do collide.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:45,840 –&gt; 00:11:52,360<br>And again, nobody’s claiming that this is easy, but this is the physics part.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:52,360 –&gt; 00:11:56,800<br>And it’s worked out and it comes from Newton’s second law.</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:56,799 –&gt; 00:12:03,439<br>And anybody taking high school physics will be able to deal with these formulas.</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:03,439 –&gt; 00:12:10,319<br>The rest of us may have to go to our reference book to get up to speed on them.</p>
<p>143<br>00:12:10,319 –&gt; 00:12:18,319<br>But once it’s reduced to code, we can be, it might have some trouble debugging at first, but at least we can be convinced that it works.</p>
<p>144<br>00:12:18,319 –&gt; 00:12:21,399<br>But now let’s look at the computer science code.</p>
<p>145<br>00:12:21,399 –&gt; 00:12:31,439<br>So this is just extending our ball data type that we use for the bouncing balls that didn’t collide to taking into account these extra things.</p>
<p>146<br>00:12:31,439 –&gt; 00:12:38,799<br>So ours will have mass so there’ll be some big, heavy ones that make things more interesting.</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:38,799 –&gt; 00:12:44,240<br>And there’s also a variable called count, which is the number of collisions the particles have been involved in.</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:44,240 –&gt; 00:12:48,159<br>And that’s useful for a couple of purposes.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:48,159 –&gt; 00:12:58,799<br>So we’re going to need a bunch of procedures which do the prediction and the collision resolution.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:58,799 –&gt; 00:13:00,799<br>What’s given a particle?</p>
<p>151<br>00:13:00,799 –&gt; 00:13:03,919<br>What’s the time until we hit that particle?</p>
<p>152<br>00:13:03,919 –&gt; 00:13:06,799<br>What’s the time until we hit a vertical horizontal wall?</p>
<p>153<br>00:13:06,799 –&gt; 00:13:13,120<br>And the same thing is if we’re at the point where we’re hitting a particle, what do we do?</p>
<p>154<br>00:13:13,120 –&gt; 00:13:15,799<br>Same with vertical and horizontal wall.</p>
<p>155<br>00:13:15,799 –&gt; 00:13:17,319<br>So that’s the skeleton.</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:17,319 –&gt; 00:13:23,039<br>We need those procedures that implement those physics rules for every particle.</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:23,039 –&gt; 00:13:25,439<br>And this is what they look like.</p>
<p>158<br>00:13:25,439 –&gt; 00:13:28,079<br>And again, this is high school physics.</p>
<p>159<br>00:13:28,079 –&gt; 00:13:34,919<br>So we’re not going to do it in detail other than to point out it’s really not a huge amount of code.</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:34,919 –&gt; 00:13:41,399<br>Lots of dexes and dewise and dvs, but really not huge amount of code.</p>
<p>161<br>00:13:41,399 –&gt; 00:13:45,759<br>And the other point is we’re going to return infinity if there’s no collision at all.</p>
<p>162<br>00:13:45,759 –&gt; 00:13:49,240<br>So that is going to keep that on the particle.</p>
<p>163<br>00:13:49,240 –&gt; 00:13:52,120<br>That’s the end on the particle forever.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:52,120 –&gt; 00:13:56,679<br>OK, so that’s the procedures that we need.</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:56,679 –&gt; 00:14:00,879<br>And then there’s similar ones for the horizontal and vertical walls.</p>
<p>166<br>00:14:00,879 –&gt; 00:14:10,759<br>OK, so now let’s look at the main loop for the invent-driven simulation.</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:10,759 –&gt; 00:14:15,399<br>So the first thing is we’re going to, for every particle,</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:15,399 –&gt; 00:14:21,120<br>we’re going to compute the next time that it might hit every horizontal and vertical wall.</p>
<p>169<br>00:14:21,120 –&gt; 00:14:24,360<br>Well, actually, if it’s going away from a wall, it’s not going to hit it.</p>
<p>170<br>00:14:24,360 –&gt; 00:14:26,279<br>So that would be infinity.</p>
<p>171<br>00:14:26,279 –&gt; 00:14:30,799<br>But if it’s going towards a wall, then we’ll compute the time.</p>
<p>172<br>00:14:30,799 –&gt; 00:14:33,840<br>And then that’s a time in the future.</p>
<p>173<br>00:14:33,840 –&gt; 00:14:38,240<br>And we’ll put that event on the priority queue with that time as the key.</p>
<p>174<br>00:14:38,240 –&gt; 00:14:41,120<br>And then we’ll do the same thing for all pairs of particles.</p>
<p>175<br>00:14:41,120 –&gt; 00:14:50,440<br>So we do have a quadratic initialization phase that we perform just wants to get the priority queue filled up.</p>
<p>176<br>00:14:50,440 –&gt; 00:14:53,720<br>Now, all collisions might not happen.</p>
<p>177<br>00:14:53,720 –&gt; 00:14:58,200<br>So we might have two particles that are on a collision course.</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:58,200 –&gt; 00:15:03,720<br>And we’re going to predict that point for both of those particles, even right at the beginning.</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:03,720 –&gt; 00:15:08,639<br>But it might be the case that there’s a third particle that knocks one of those out before that thing happens.</p>
<p>180<br>00:15:08,639 –&gt; 00:15:11,399<br>And that event would be invalidated.</p>
<p>181<br>00:15:11,399 –&gt; 00:15:17,399<br>So the simulation has to be careful to take that into account.</p>
<p>182<br>00:15:17,399 –&gt; 00:15:20,639<br>But that’s not difficult to do.</p>
<p>183<br>00:15:20,639 –&gt; 00:15:23,159<br>So here’s what the main loop is.</p>
<p>184<br>00:15:23,159 –&gt; 00:15:26,120<br>So we’re going to take the next event from the priority queue.</p>
<p>185<br>00:15:26,120 –&gt; 00:15:28,319<br>That’s the next collision that’s going to happen.</p>
<p>186<br>00:15:28,319 –&gt; 00:15:33,600<br>From all our calculations, there’s one collision that’s going to happen next.</p>
<p>187<br>00:15:33,600 –&gt; 00:15:36,960<br>Then we test whether that event has been invalidated.</p>
<p>188<br>00:15:36,960 –&gt; 00:15:42,000<br>And we do that by using that count field in the particle.</p>
<p>189<br>00:15:42,000 –&gt; 00:15:45,639<br>So then that tells us what time it’s going to be next.</p>
<p>190<br>00:15:45,639 –&gt; 00:15:50,759<br>So then we have to go through all the particles and change their positions on a straight line trajectory.</p>
<p>191<br>00:15:50,759 –&gt; 00:15:54,320<br>Where would there be after that much time?</p>
<p>192<br>00:15:54,320 –&gt; 00:15:58,440<br>Then we have to take the two particles that collide and change their velocities.</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:58,440 –&gt; 00:16:00,680<br>They bounce off one another.</p>
<p>194<br>00:16:00,680 –&gt; 00:16:04,000<br>Now those two particles velocities have changed.</p>
<p>195<br>00:16:04,000 –&gt; 00:16:08,240<br>Essentially, that invalidates the future collisions involving those.</p>
<p>196<br>00:16:08,240 –&gt; 00:16:12,440<br>And then what we have to do is for those two particles is go through and</p>
<p>197<br>00:16:12,440 –&gt; 00:16:17,519<br>predict the future collisions with any walls and collisions with any other particles.</p>
<p>198<br>00:16:17,519 –&gt; 00:16:21,120<br>And put all those new events onto the priority queue.</p>
<p>199<br>00:16:21,120 –&gt; 00:16:22,000<br>But that’s it.</p>
<p>200<br>00:16:22,000 –&gt; 00:16:31,120<br>You got two particles, change their velocities, figure out the future collisions of those particles with the wall and update the priority queue.</p>
<p>201<br>00:16:31,120 –&gt; 00:16:35,279<br>And then the main loop is take the next thing off the priority queue and keep going.</p>
<p>202<br>00:16:35,279 –&gt; 00:16:39,240<br>That’s the code that we’ll look at next.</p>
<p>203<br>00:16:39,240 –&gt; 00:16:48,519<br>So we have a bunch of convictions just to reduce the code.</p>
<p>204<br>00:16:48,519 –&gt; 00:16:56,680<br>And if we have this thing called event, which involves, it says between two particles,</p>
<p>205<br>00:16:56,680 –&gt; 00:16:59,120<br>something is going to happen at a certain time.</p>
<p>206<br>00:16:59,120 –&gt; 00:17:04,880<br>And we’re going to adopt the conventions that if neither particle is null,</p>
<p>207<br>00:17:04,880 –&gt; 00:17:07,160<br>then we’re talking about two particles.</p>
<p>208<br>00:17:07,160 –&gt; 00:17:13,400<br>If one of the particles is null, then we’re talking about a wall, a vertical or horizontal wall.</p>
<p>209<br>00:17:13,400 –&gt; 00:17:17,960<br>And if both particles are null, we’re saying we just want to redraw things.</p>
<p>210<br>00:17:17,960 –&gt; 00:17:21,680<br>That’s a bit of a hack, but it cuts down a lot of code.</p>
<p>211<br>00:17:21,680 –&gt; 00:17:24,720<br>Our compare to is by time.</p>
<p>212<br>00:17:24,720 –&gt; 00:17:30,759<br>And then again, we need an is valid to check about intervening collision.</p>
<p>213<br>00:17:30,759 –&gt; 00:17:37,960<br>And then here’s the skeleton of what’s going to happen with the collision system,</p>
<p>214<br>00:17:37,960 –&gt; 00:17:49,920<br>which is the key thing is this prediction method that takes a particle as argument</p>
<p>215<br>00:17:49,920 –&gt; 00:17:56,800<br>and adds to the priority queue all the possible collisions involving this particle.</p>
<p>216<br>00:17:56,800 –&gt; 00:18:02,400<br>So it’s going to go through every particle and call the time to hit method for that particle.</p>
<p>217<br>00:18:02,400 –&gt; 00:18:10,400<br>And then it’ll put an event on the priority queue for that time, this particle with that particle.</p>
<p>218<br>00:18:10,400 –&gt; 00:18:15,800<br>And then it’ll also put an event for the vertical wall in the horizontal wall,</p>
<p>219<br>00:18:15,799 –&gt; 00:18:21,720<br>again using this null convention to say that the second argument null is vertical,</p>
<p>220<br>00:18:21,720 –&gt; 00:18:24,919<br>first argument null is horizontal.</p>
<p>221<br>00:18:24,919 –&gt; 00:18:33,960<br>So that’s a key method that gets used in the simulation for each of the two particles that are going to collide.</p>
<p>222<br>00:18:33,960 –&gt; 00:18:40,319<br>So now we can look finally at the main event driven simulation loop.</p>
<p>223<br>00:18:40,319 –&gt; 00:18:45,839<br>So there’s build the priority queue.</p>
<p>224<br>00:18:45,839 –&gt; 00:18:50,480<br>There’s do this prediction for every one of the particles.</p>
<p>225<br>00:18:50,480 –&gt; 00:18:54,839<br>And then also we’re going to put, as the first thing that happened,</p>
<p>226<br>00:18:54,839 –&gt; 00:18:59,240<br>always an event that says redraw everything.</p>
<p>227<br>00:18:59,240 –&gt; 00:19:05,679<br>So that’s just a way of ensuring that the simulation keeps proceeding.</p>
<p>228<br>00:19:05,679 –&gt; 00:19:09,119<br>It’s an easy way to get things drawn.</p>
<p>229<br>00:19:10,960 –&gt; 00:19:19,599<br>OK, so now the main loop is while the priority queue is not empty, we’re going to pull off an event.</p>
<p>230<br>00:19:19,599 –&gt; 00:19:22,799<br>We’re going to test whether it’s valid.</p>
<p>231<br>00:19:22,799 –&gt; 00:19:27,439<br>And that’s just check if anything happened with those two particles.</p>
<p>232<br>00:19:27,439 –&gt; 00:19:30,279<br>We’re going to pull off the two particles.</p>
<p>233<br>00:19:30,279 –&gt; 00:19:38,639<br>And then we’re going to all part, we’re going to move all particles by the amount of time that has elapsed</p>
<p>234<br>00:19:38,640 –&gt; 00:19:40,759<br>since the last event.</p>
<p>235<br>00:19:40,759 –&gt; 00:19:44,400<br>And then we’re going to test which of the four types of events that it is.</p>
<p>236<br>00:19:44,400 –&gt; 00:19:51,680<br>It’s either redraw, bounce B of A, or bounce off a vertical or horizontal wall.</p>
<p>237<br>00:19:51,680 –&gt; 00:19:56,200<br>And then we’ll go ahead and do the predictions of each of those particles, A and B,</p>
<p>238<br>00:19:56,200 –&gt; 00:19:58,640<br>against all other particles.</p>
<p>239<br>00:19:58,640 –&gt; 00:20:03,440<br>That’s pretty much all the code for the simulation.</p>
<p>240<br>00:20:03,440 –&gt; 00:20:06,400<br>So this is data-driven code.</p>
<p>241<br>00:20:06,400 –&gt; 00:20:16,080<br>So one thing we can do is just run it for 100 balls in random position at random velocity.</p>
<p>242<br>00:20:16,080 –&gt; 00:20:20,640<br>But what’s nice about data-driven code is now that the code’s working.</p>
<p>243<br>00:20:20,640 –&gt; 00:20:25,560<br>And again, we’re not saying this is a trivial code to write.</p>
<p>244<br>00:20:25,560 –&gt; 00:20:33,519<br>But it’s definitely manageable and it’s enabled by priority queues.</p>
<p>245<br>00:20:33,519 –&gt; 00:20:39,519<br>Without priority queues, we quite a bit more complicated to figure out how to do this.</p>
<p>246<br>00:20:39,519 –&gt; 00:20:46,200<br>And also, it wouldn’t be reasonably efficient at all for large data sets.</p>
<p>247<br>00:20:46,200 –&gt; 00:20:52,119<br>So that’s a simple simulation, just generate random positions.</p>
<p>248<br>00:20:52,119 –&gt; 00:20:57,359<br>People might be interested in this one.</p>
<p>249<br>00:20:57,359 –&gt; 00:21:02,559<br>Now, this isn’t exactly precisely what would happen in the real world,</p>
<p>250<br>00:21:02,559 –&gt; 00:21:11,119<br>mainly because we didn’t put in the simulation what happens when three particles are touching,</p>
<p>251<br>00:21:11,119 –&gt; 00:21:14,159<br>or there’s two touching in another one hits them.</p>
<p>252<br>00:21:14,159 –&gt; 00:21:22,159<br>And also, nobody racks up a set of billiard balls such that all 15 are touching in all places.</p>
<p>253<br>00:21:22,159 –&gt; 00:21:28,079<br>So life can be complicated when you’re trying to simulate the natural world.</p>
<p>254<br>00:21:28,079 –&gt; 00:21:33,759<br>This is a little bit about Einstein’s experiment.</p>
<p>255<br>00:21:33,759 –&gt; 00:21:40,079<br>If you got one big particle like a pollen grain and lots of little particles,</p>
<p>256<br>00:21:40,079 –&gt; 00:21:50,960<br>like atoms molecules, bouncing against it, the big one is going to move about randomly.</p>
<p>257<br>00:21:50,960 –&gt; 00:21:58,559<br>And then this is another famous physics experiment showing diffusion.</p>
<p>258<br>00:21:58,559 –&gt; 00:22:03,920<br>And there’s many other things that you can do with this basic collision system.</p>
<p>259<br>00:22:03,920 –&gt; 00:22:08,559<br>If you have huge numbers of particles and you measure the number that hit the size and the frequency</p>
<p>260<br>00:22:08,559 –&gt; 00:22:15,920<br>with which they hit the sides, you can do experiments relating temperature and pressure</p>
<p>261<br>00:22:15,920 –&gt; 00:22:19,519<br>in many other things or do three-dimensional versions.</p>
<p>262<br>00:22:19,519 –&gt; 00:22:27,359<br>Again, simulation of the natural world is an increasingly important application of computing</p>
<p>263<br>00:22:28,400 –&gt; 00:22:34,960<br>and need efficient data structures like priority cues to get it done.</p>
