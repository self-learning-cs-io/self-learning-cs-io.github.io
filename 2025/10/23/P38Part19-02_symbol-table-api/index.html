                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,799<br>Welcome back. In this in the next few lectures, we’re going to look at symbol tables, a fundamental</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,799 –&gt; 00:00:14,599<br>and extremely important data type that have led to all kinds of fascinating implementations.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,599 –&gt; 00:00:19,719<br>And we’re going to look at several of them in this course. To begin, we’ll take a look</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,719 –&gt; 00:00:25,280<br>at the API and some elementary implementations and various operations that people want to</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:25,280 –&gt; 00:00:32,960<br>perform on symbol tables. Start with the API. The idea behind symbol tables is to implement</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:32,960 –&gt; 00:00:40,880<br>the following abstraction. We’re going to have keys like our keys in priority cues, but</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:40,880 –&gt; 00:00:47,439<br>the whole idea is that we’re going to want to associate values with each key. So the</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:47,439 –&gt; 00:00:53,000<br>two operations that we’re going to perform in symbol tables is the insert operation. We’re</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:53,000 –&gt; 00:00:59,079<br>really putting a key value pair into the symbol table, a value with a specified key. And then</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:59,079 –&gt; 00:01:05,439<br>given a key, we want to search for the corresponding value. Those are the two basic operations. Now</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:05,439 –&gt; 00:01:11,960<br>the keys in the values can interchange roles, and that’s why we have the abstraction to separate them.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:11,960 –&gt; 00:01:21,280<br>So for example, a domain name server might have a look up where you’ve got a table that’s got an</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:21,280 –&gt; 00:01:30,200<br>IP address and a URL associated with that IP address. In different clients, we might want to use</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:30,200 –&gt; 00:01:37,439<br>this data in different ways. One might want to use the URL as key, given the URL, give us the</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:37,439 –&gt; 00:01:45,480<br>corresponding IP address. Another client might want to use the IP address as key, have an IP address,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:45,480 –&gt; 00:01:52,520<br>give me the corresponding client. So those are just a couple of examples. This is a very fundamental</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:52,520 –&gt; 00:02:03,080<br>and basic abstraction. And the list of applications is huge. In fact, almost any computer application</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:03,080 –&gt; 00:02:10,520<br>system is going to have a symbol table or multiple symbols tables at its core. All the way down to the</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:10,520 –&gt; 00:02:20,600<br>basic memory system of the computer or the networking system that your computer access to information depends on.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:20,600 –&gt; 00:02:28,840<br>You can think of it intuitively as a like-addictionary. Well, there used to be books and people would open up</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:28,840 –&gt; 00:02:35,560<br>those books to look for a word to find the definition. Nowadays, you’re more likely to do that online.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:35,960 –&gt; 00:02:43,960<br>Or when you’re trying to find a song to download, you provide the name of the song and then the value of</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:43,960 –&gt; 00:02:49,960<br>tell you what computer go to to get that. Or in commercial computing, the key might be an account</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:49,960 –&gt; 00:02:56,920<br>number and the value might be the transaction details for that account. Web search is something we</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:56,920 –&gt; 00:03:02,840<br>all do multiple times every day and the key is a keyword or a list of keywords and the value is a</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:02,840 –&gt; 00:03:09,159<br>list of places where that keyword is found. In this many, many other applications, including</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:09,159 –&gt; 00:03:17,080<br>scientific applications where, say, in genomics, people use symbol tables to keep track of</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:18,680 –&gt; 00:03:25,879<br>finding markers in a genome and, again, many other applications. So it’s a very fundamental</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:25,879 –&gt; 00:03:32,599<br>concept and we’ll look at plenty of applications. But first, we want to look at some algorithms.</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:33,800 –&gt; 00:03:40,280<br>So the way that it’s convenient to set up a symbol table is to implement the so-called</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:40,280 –&gt; 00:03:48,520<br>associative array abstraction. And the idea behind that is to think about just associating one</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:48,520 –&gt; 00:03:58,680<br>value with each key. And well, it’s like in a Java array of integers, say, we’re only our keys in</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:58,680 –&gt; 00:04:05,400<br>that case are indices that are restricted to be between zero and the array size. But we’re</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:05,400 –&gt; 00:04:11,560<br>only associating one value with each index. We think of storing the value in the array position</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:11,560 –&gt; 00:04:17,639<br>given by that index. And a good way to think of a symbol table is, as shown in the right here,</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:18,519 –&gt; 00:04:26,920<br>when we put a key value pair onto the symbol table, think of that as using the key to index</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:26,920 –&gt; 00:04:34,040<br>an array and storing the value there. Now, this isn’t legal in Java if key is not an int and we’re</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:34,040 –&gt; 00:04:41,319<br>going to do this generic. It can be any type of data. But it’s a good way to think about it. And then</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:41,319 –&gt; 00:04:49,000<br>to retrieve it, you just give that same key and it’ll return the value. So that’s our two primary</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:49,000 –&gt; 00:04:58,759<br>operations. Put a key value pair into the table. So that is associate the value with key and then</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:58,759 –&gt; 00:05:04,600<br>get the value paired with the key. There’s particular rules for null that I’ll talk about in a second.</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:06,439 –&gt; 00:05:14,199<br>Then to properly maintain a symbol table in a dynamic situation, in many clients you want to</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:14,199 –&gt; 00:05:26,120<br>support a delete operation and contains a simpler operation than get convenient for many clients.</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:26,920 –&gt; 00:05:33,480<br>It just tells us whether there’s some value paired with that key in the table is empty and size.</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:34,279 –&gt; 00:05:39,240<br>And then another thing that you might want to do is iterate through all the keys in the table.</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:40,199 –&gt; 00:05:47,319<br>So those are the basic operations that we’re going to want to implement to get the associate of</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:47,319 –&gt; 00:05:54,360<br>array abstraction. And then there’s many, many possibilities for clients and we’ll look at some later on.</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:57,240 –&gt; 00:06:04,360<br>Now there’s a couple of conventions around null and these are not critical but they make it</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:04,360 –&gt; 00:06:13,319<br>a bit more convenient for several implementations. So we’re not going to allow null values. You</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:13,319 –&gt; 00:06:20,680<br>can’t associate null with any key and then we’re going to adopt the convention that the get method</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:20,680 –&gt; 00:06:28,520<br>returns null if the key is not present in the table. And also the associative array abstraction</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:28,519 –&gt; 00:06:35,319<br>is the put method will overwrite an old value with a new value. So these are our consequences.</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:35,319 –&gt; 00:06:42,519<br>So the contains implementation is the same for all our symbol table implementations.</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:43,560 –&gt; 00:06:50,519<br>If get returns a non-null value then there’s a value corresponding to the key in the table if it returns</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:50,519 –&gt; 00:06:58,919<br>null it’s not get returns couldn’t null if keys not present. And the other thing that we can do is we</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:58,919 –&gt; 00:07:07,639<br>can use null in some situations or temporary situations to implement a lazy version of the</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:07,639 –&gt; 00:07:16,439<br>delete operation. We can associate the key with null internally and then applying one of the</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:16,439 –&gt; 00:07:22,360<br>difference whether that’s in there or not and some algorithms take advantage of the ability to</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:22,360 –&gt; 00:07:27,879<br>use null in this way. These are just conventions and somewhat details but it’s important to point</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:27,879 –&gt; 00:07:34,839<br>them out at front. So now we’re going to want the value to be any generic type at all but the key</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:34,839 –&gt; 00:07:40,920<br>type we have to make some natural assumptions about them and actually there’s different assumptions</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:40,920 –&gt; 00:07:47,640<br>that we make in our implementations depending on the application. One of the most useful ones is</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:47,640 –&gt; 00:07:55,240<br>to have comparable keys just as inserting algorithms will assume that the keys have values that come</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:55,240 –&gt; 00:08:01,960<br>from a total order and we can use compare to to compare whether one key is less than or not.</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:02,840 –&gt; 00:08:09,560<br>This is for two reasons. One is we can get more efficient implementations if we can use the</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:09,560 –&gt; 00:08:15,959<br>ordering of the keys to help us find our way around the data structure. And the other reason is that</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:15,959 –&gt; 00:08:23,560<br>we can support a broader set of simple table operations that are very convenient for many clients.</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:23,560 –&gt; 00:08:30,680<br>And it’s very typical for keys to come from an ordered set for example in the dictionary application</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:30,680 –&gt; 00:08:38,039<br>or if keys are strings or numbers or count numbers or many other situations. So if they’re going to</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:38,039 –&gt; 00:08:44,039<br>be comparable we might as well take advantage of it both to get more efficient algorithms and to be</p>
<p>71<br>00:08:44,039 –&gt; 00:08:51,879<br>able to take advantage of a broader set of operations. Now in other situations maybe they’re not comparable</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:52,759 –&gt; 00:08:57,959<br>and all we are allowed to use is to use the equals operation that is everything</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:59,480 –&gt; 00:09:04,679<br>every type of data and Java has to support it equals operation that we use that to test whether</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:04,679 –&gt; 00:09:12,359<br>they’re equal. And there’s another family of methods where there’s no ordering and there’s a</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:12,359 –&gt; 00:09:23,239<br>special method called hash code that helps us inject randomness into the process. That’s built into</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:23,239 –&gt; 00:09:30,519<br>Java and also some classic algorithms depend on that. We’re going to start out with the comparable mostly.</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:30,519 –&gt; 00:09:42,120<br>And again as with priority cues the best practice is to use immutable types and experience programmers know</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:42,120 –&gt; 00:09:47,960<br>this and it’s not difficult not to arrange for the natural types of data that people are going to use</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:47,960 –&gt; 00:09:55,879<br>for simple table keys. Unreasonable to expect the implementation to work well if the client contain the</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:55,879 –&gt; 00:10:02,439<br>valid can change the values of keys that are in the table. If you want that you have to provide that</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:03,320 –&gt; 00:10:10,759<br>as a specific operation in a case of simple tables we’re not going to do that you have to remove it and put</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:10,759 –&gt; 00:10:18,439<br>it back in. All right so there’s equality. Now equality again we’re getting into programming language</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:18,439 –&gt; 00:10:25,399<br>issue but still it’s important to be explicit about what’s going on with equality. How do we test</p>
<p>84<br>00:10:26,279 –&gt; 00:10:38,200<br>if two objects are equal? So Java’s got requirements as for compared to and here’s the basic</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:38,200 –&gt; 00:10:46,840<br>requirements about equals. There’s a method that all Java classes in a here for equals but the</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:46,840 –&gt; 00:10:53,159<br>default implementation is simply to test whether the references are equal. There’s are those</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:53,159 –&gt; 00:10:58,439<br>precisely the same objects are not. Usually in applications when we want to have something more</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:58,439 –&gt; 00:11:04,519<br>general than that have a concept of a value or like a key in our case and then we want to know if two</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:04,519 –&gt; 00:11:09,719<br>references refer to objects that have the same value and we want to call that equal. That’s what</p>
<p>90<br>00:11:09,719 –&gt; 00:11:17,319<br>equals is about. So anyway we’re required to make sure that x is always equal to x and that x</p>
<p>91<br>00:11:17,320 –&gt; 00:11:25,160<br>equals y is the same as y equals x and if x equals y y equals z then x equals z that means that</p>
<p>92<br>00:11:25,160 –&gt; 00:11:34,040<br>mathematical terms equals is called an equivalence relation and also no object is equal to null.</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:34,760 –&gt; 00:11:43,400<br>So those are absolute requirements for Java. And again the default implementation is to check</p>
<p>94<br>00:11:43,399 –&gt; 00:11:49,480<br>whether they refer to the same object and that’s rarely what we want. Java systems programs maybe</p>
<p>95<br>00:11:49,480 –&gt; 00:11:58,439<br>want that. The client programs usually have customized implementations that are based on comparing</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:58,439 –&gt; 00:12:03,799<br>some sort of value. In the standard built-in types of the Java language are going to have those</p>
<p>97<br>00:12:03,799 –&gt; 00:12:09,399<br>customized implementations and we can rely on them doing what we expect. If we’re going to</p>
<p>98<br>00:12:09,399 –&gt; 00:12:17,000<br>implement our own types and then use those types as keys and symbol tables you have to exercise</p>
<p>99<br>00:12:17,000 –&gt; 00:12:23,879<br>a little bit of care and we’ll talk about that briefly. So say we have this simplified date</p>
<p>100<br>00:12:23,879 –&gt; 00:12:30,120<br>implementation that we had talked about before. It’s a mutable type and every date’s got a month</p>
<p>101<br>00:12:30,120 –&gt; 00:12:38,199<br>a day and a year. It seems like it should be easy to implement equals. Basically we’re just going</p>
<p>102<br>00:12:38,200 –&gt; 00:12:43,879<br>to check that all the significant fields are the same. Two dates should be equal if they have the</p>
<p>103<br>00:12:43,879 –&gt; 00:12:50,759<br>same day, month and year and if any one of those are not the same value then just return false.</p>
<p>104<br>00:12:51,640 –&gt; 00:12:58,600<br>So that seems as if it should work but that doesn’t have all the characteristics that we need in</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:58,600 –&gt; 00:13:08,680<br>the Java implementation and so all of this code in red shows a model for what you might do if you’re</p>
<p>106<br>00:13:08,680 –&gt; 00:13:17,639<br>going to implement your own type of data equals for your own type of data. So it shouldn’t use it in</p>
<p>107<br>00:13:17,639 –&gt; 00:13:22,120<br>connection with inheritance so we’re going to use inheritance that much so I won’t talk about that.</p>
<p>108<br>00:13:22,440 –&gt; 00:13:31,560<br>The type of the argument in the equals must be object. You think it should be date and experts debate</p>
<p>109<br>00:13:31,560 –&gt; 00:13:39,960<br>about that and people are interested can look on the web for that kind of date. If it is the case that</p>
<p>110<br>00:13:39,960 –&gt; 00:13:46,680<br>you happen to be testing two objects that are the same object for equality you might as well optimize</p>
<p>111<br>00:13:46,679 –&gt; 00:13:53,399<br>everything and just test that. If y is a reference that’s pointing to the same object as this object</p>
<p>112<br>00:13:53,399 –&gt; 00:13:58,359<br>just return true because if you’re going to test the values they’re going to have the same values anyway</p>
<p>113<br>00:13:58,359 –&gt; 00:14:04,759<br>and that’s a good optimization for lots of situations. Y go through all that rest of that code if you</p>
<p>114<br>00:14:04,759 –&gt; 00:14:12,599<br>know right away they’re equal. There’s this test for null that has to be there and if it’s not there</p>
<p>115<br>00:14:12,600 –&gt; 00:14:21,720<br>can lead to nefarious bugs and unusual problems so you’re equals test you better test that the client</p>
<p>116<br>00:14:21,720 –&gt; 00:14:29,240<br>didn’t give you null. They have to be in the same class and well there’s a couple of different ways</p>
<p>117<br>00:14:29,240 –&gt; 00:14:34,920<br>to check about the same class and that’s another religious debate that will ignore we’ll use</p>
<p>118<br>00:14:35,879 –&gt; 00:14:42,919<br>get class and that’s something that’s got to work or they’ll get an exception in this later</p>
<p>119<br>00:14:44,120 –&gt; 00:14:51,159<br>code because since y had to be an object now we have to cast it to a date and then better be</p>
<p>120<br>00:14:51,159 –&gt; 00:14:59,240<br>the right class or they’re not going to have these fields that we can test for. So details but</p>
<p>121<br>00:14:59,720 –&gt; 00:15:07,560<br>anyway you can use this code as a model to implement equals for any data type that you might wind</p>
<p>122<br>00:15:07,560 –&gt; 00:15:16,039<br>up using as a symbol table key. Okay so that’s a standard this is just in words the standard</p>
<p>123<br>00:15:16,039 –&gt; 00:15:23,240<br>repress a recipe for user type optimized for reference equality check against null. Make sure</p>
<p>124<br>00:15:23,240 –&gt; 00:15:28,519<br>they’re the same type and do the casting and then compare all the similar significant fields.</p>
<p>125<br>00:15:28,519 –&gt; 00:15:33,639<br>It could be that if one of the fields is an object then you use that objects equals which</p>
<p>126<br>00:15:33,639 –&gt; 00:15:44,519<br>replies the world be rule recursively. Then if you have a field that’s an array you can go ahead</p>
<p>127<br>00:15:44,519 –&gt; 00:15:51,879<br>and try applying it to each entry and there’s implementations in Java you don’t want to use a equals</p>
<p>128<br>00:15:51,879 –&gt; 00:15:56,840<br>a dot equals b that checks if those arrays are the same objects and that’s not what you want</p>
<p>129<br>00:15:56,840 –&gt; 00:16:01,480<br>you want to check that all the values are the same. And if it’s array of objects you can see that</p>
<p>130<br>00:16:01,480 –&gt; 00:16:10,600<br>testing for equals can actually involve a lot of code and a lot of cost. All right so and certainly</p>
<p>131<br>00:16:10,600 –&gt; 00:16:17,080<br>you want to follow some of these best practices so fields that are most likely to differ those</p>
<p>132<br>00:16:17,080 –&gt; 00:16:24,040<br>the ones you might want to compare first and you’re also going to want to make compare to consistent</p>
<p>133<br>00:16:24,039 –&gt; 00:16:30,599<br>with the equals. Though we’ll generally if we have comparable types we’ll use compare to and if</p>
<p>134<br>00:16:30,599 –&gt; 00:16:37,480<br>we don’t have comparable types we’ll use equals. Okay so now let’s look at a couple of test clients</p>
<p>135<br>00:16:37,480 –&gt; 00:16:46,120<br>before we look at any particular implementation. So this is a test client so symbol tables are</p>
<p>136<br>00:16:46,120 –&gt; 00:16:56,519<br>ST is the type symbol table they’re generic on key and value and so this</p>
<p>137<br>00:16:59,560 –&gt; 00:17:06,039<br>statement builds a new symbol table with string keys and integer values so it’s going to associate</p>
<p>138<br>00:17:06,039 –&gt; 00:17:13,079<br>integers with strings and so that what the test client’s going to do is going to just</p>
<p>139<br>00:17:13,079 –&gt; 00:17:21,000<br>go in the loop as long as standard in is not empty and it’s going to read strings read a string</p>
<p>140<br>00:17:21,000 –&gt; 00:17:27,159<br>off standard input and then put it in the symbol table associated with the value i where it</p>
<p>141<br>00:17:27,159 –&gt; 00:17:35,480<br>appear in the input. So this is an indexing client where we associate each string with its position</p>
<p>142<br>00:17:35,640 –&gt; 00:17:43,640<br>most recent position in the input and notice it’s an associative array implementation so for</p>
<p>143<br>00:17:43,640 –&gt; 00:17:51,720<br>example we have two E’s and at the end E is associated value 12 the place where it most recently appeared</p>
<p>144<br>00:17:52,440 –&gt; 00:18:01,079<br>we could also keep these things in a bag and do a client that gives all the positions that appear</p>
<p>145<br>00:18:01,079 –&gt; 00:18:04,919<br>this is a simple indexing client that we use for our traces.</p>
<p>146<br>00:18:09,720 –&gt; 00:18:14,839<br>For analysis for bigger problems we’ll use a client called a frequency counter client</p>
<p>147<br>00:18:16,039 –&gt; 00:18:22,119<br>and so that one is going to read a sequence of strings from standard input and print out the one</p>
<p>148<br>00:18:22,119 –&gt; 00:18:30,439<br>that occurs with highest frequency. So for this small data from the beginning of</p>
<p>149<br>00:18:31,079 –&gt; 00:18:38,199<br>Dickens’ tale of two cities if we run a frequency counter the frequency counter client</p>
<p>150<br>00:18:39,559 –&gt; 00:18:47,480<br>and this first argument is just ignore words a fewer than this many letters it’ll say that the</p>
<p>151<br>00:18:47,480 –&gt; 00:18:54,039<br>most frequent word where there’s no word that appears more frequently than it which appears ten times</p>
<p>152<br>00:18:55,000 –&gt; 00:19:03,799<br>and we’ll want this client to work well for huge data sets so Leapsig is a data set from the web of</p>
<p>153<br>00:19:03,799 –&gt; 00:19:12,279<br>20 million words about half a million distinct ones and in that corpus the word government</p>
<p>154<br>00:19:12,279 –&gt; 00:19:21,960<br>appears about 25,000 times. So if you have a quadratic time algorithm for implementing</p>
<p>155<br>00:19:22,920 –&gt; 00:19:29,079<br>symbol tables or linear time for each operation you’re not going to be able to run this client in</p>
<p>156<br>00:19:29,079 –&gt; 00:19:34,840<br>a reasonable amount of time for a big amount of data so that’s the client that we’re going to use for</p>
<p>157<br>00:19:34,840 –&gt; 00:19:42,759<br>analysis. Here’s the code for that frequency counter client. Again it’s similar to the other one</p>
<p>158<br>00:19:42,759 –&gt; 00:19:49,000<br>we’re creating a symbol table that associates strings with integers. We take that command line</p>
<p>159<br>00:19:49,000 –&gt; 00:19:55,319<br>argument which is the minimum length that we care about. We’ll read a new word and we’ll ignore</p>
<p>160<br>00:19:55,319 –&gt; 00:20:02,200<br>the short strings just trap out if the word length is too small and now the integer that we’re</p>
<p>161<br>00:20:02,200 –&gt; 00:20:10,519<br>going to associate with each word is the frequency of occurrence of that word in the symbol table.</p>
<p>162<br>00:20:10,519 –&gt; 00:20:15,480<br>So if the word’s not in the symbol table we’ll put it there with a frequency of occurrence of</p>
<p>163<br>00:20:15,480 –&gt; 00:20:21,160<br>one that’s the first time we saw the word. If it is in the symbol table we’ll just overwrite</p>
<p>164<br>00:20:21,160 –&gt; 00:20:28,680<br>the old value which is stget word with the new value stget word plus one. So increment the frequency</p>
<p>165<br>00:20:28,680 –&gt; 00:20:35,880<br>in the symbol table. So this loop reads in all the data and associates each word with its frequency</p>
<p>166<br>00:20:35,880 –&gt; 00:20:42,039<br>of occurrence and then we’ll have a client that uses the iterator going through all the keys in</p>
<p>167<br>00:20:42,039 –&gt; 00:20:49,720<br>the symbol table. It’ll get the value associated with each key and if that’s bigger than the</p>
<p>168<br>00:20:49,720 –&gt; 00:20:59,000<br>maximum found so far we’ll save that away and then print out the word that occurs the most often</p>
<p>169<br>00:20:59,000 –&gt; 00:21:06,599<br>along with its frequency. So this is a useful and non-trivial client that’s enabled by symbol table</p>
<p>170<br>00:21:07,559 –&gt; 00:21:13,159<br>but it won’t work well unless we have an efficient symbol table operation and we’ll use this</p>
<p>171<br>00:21:13,159 –&gt; 00:21:22,199<br>client to compare different symbol table implementations. So that’s the symbol table API and next we’ll</p>
<p>172<br>00:21:22,200 –&gt; 00:21:24,200<br>take a look at implementations.</p>
