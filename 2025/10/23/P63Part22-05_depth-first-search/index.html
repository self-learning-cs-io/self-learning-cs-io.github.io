                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,560<br>Now we’re going to look at depth first search, which is a classical graph processing algorithm.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,560 –&gt; 00:00:15,000<br>It’s actually maybe one of the oldest algorithms that we study surprisingly.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,000 –&gt; 00:00:18,800<br>One way to think about depth first search is in terms of mazes.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,800 –&gt; 00:00:22,240<br>It’s a pretty familiar way to look at it.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,240 –&gt; 00:00:29,280<br>And so if you have a maze like the one drawn on the left, you can model it with a graph</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,280 –&gt; 00:00:36,000<br>by creating a vertex for every intersection in the maze and an edge for every passage</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:36,000 –&gt; 00:00:39,480<br>connecting to intersection.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:39,480 –&gt; 00:00:45,439<br>And so if you’re at the entrance of this maze and you want to find a pot of gold somewhere,</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:45,439 –&gt; 00:00:52,680<br>what you’re going to need to do is explore every intersection or explore every edge in the</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:52,680 –&gt; 00:00:53,680<br>maze.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:53,679 –&gt; 00:00:59,560<br>And so we’re going to talk about the explorer every intersection option.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,560 –&gt; 00:01:00,560<br>So that’s our goal.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:00,560 –&gt; 00:01:03,719<br>Have an algorithm for doing that.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:03,719 –&gt; 00:01:09,799<br>By the way, this is a famous graph that some of you might recognize.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:09,799 –&gt; 00:01:14,039<br>That’s the graph for the Pac-Man game.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:14,039 –&gt; 00:01:15,039<br>Okay.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:15,040 –&gt; 00:01:23,760<br>So one method, classic method that predates computers for exploring a maze is called</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:23,760 –&gt; 00:01:27,240<br>the Tremo maze exploration algorithm.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:27,240 –&gt; 00:01:31,880<br>The idea is to think about having a ball of string.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:31,880 –&gt; 00:01:43,120<br>And what you do is when you walk down a passage, you unroll the string behind you, and you</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,120 –&gt; 00:01:47,359<br>also mark every place that you’ve been.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:47,359 –&gt; 00:01:50,480<br>So we actually have a ball of string and some chalk maybe.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:50,480 –&gt; 00:01:53,120<br>So in this case, maybe we walk down this passage here.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:53,120 –&gt; 00:01:56,200<br>And now we have some choices about where we might go.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:56,200 –&gt; 00:02:01,880<br>So say we go down here, so we unroll our ball of string and mark it.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:01,880 –&gt; 00:02:07,680<br>And so now the next time at this intersection, we have no choice but to go up here.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:07,680 –&gt; 00:02:10,599<br>We go up here and we see, oh, we’ve already been there.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:10,599 –&gt; 00:02:13,199<br>So we’re not going to go there.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:13,199 –&gt; 00:02:18,240<br>And we come back and we have our ball of string so we can unroll it to figure out where we</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:18,240 –&gt; 00:02:19,560<br>were.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:19,560 –&gt; 00:02:25,599<br>And we go back until we have some other choice, which is this place now.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:25,599 –&gt; 00:02:28,519<br>And we mark that we’ve been these other places.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:28,519 –&gt; 00:02:32,159<br>And so now we take another option and say go down this way.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:32,159 –&gt; 00:02:35,319<br>And here we take another option and go that way.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:35,319 –&gt; 00:02:40,159<br>And then finally, again, we go up this way and we see that we’ve been there.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:40,159 –&gt; 00:02:43,159<br>So we back up and take the last option.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:43,159 –&gt; 00:02:48,719<br>And then that gets us to the last vertex in the graph.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:48,719 –&gt; 00:02:54,719<br>So mark each visited intersection and each visited passage in retrace our steps when</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:54,719 –&gt; 00:02:57,639<br>there’s no unvisited option.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:57,639 –&gt; 00:03:04,960<br>Again, this is a classical algorithm that was studied centuries ago.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:04,960 –&gt; 00:03:11,360<br>In fact, some argue the first use was when Thesius entered the lab room and was trying</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:11,360 –&gt; 00:03:14,400<br>to find a minute or.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:14,400 –&gt; 00:03:21,080<br>And Ariadne didn’t want him to get lost in the maze.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:21,080 –&gt; 00:03:27,080<br>So she instructed Thesius to use a ball of string to find his way back out.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:27,080 –&gt; 00:03:30,960<br>That’s the basic algorithm that we’re going to use.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:30,960 –&gt; 00:03:37,640<br>And it’s been studied by many, many scientists in the time since Thesius.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:37,640 –&gt; 00:03:44,520<br>And in fact, Claude Shannon, the founder of information theory, did experiments on mazes</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:44,520 –&gt; 00:03:49,879<br>with mice to see if they might understand maze exploration.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:49,879 –&gt; 00:03:52,240<br>This might help.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:52,240 –&gt; 00:03:58,520<br>Okay, so here’s what it looks like in a typical maze.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:58,520 –&gt; 00:04:05,800<br>Now, one of the things to remember is in a computer representation, normally we’re just</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:05,800 –&gt; 00:04:11,760<br>looking at the vertices in the set of associated edges, we don’t see anything other than that.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:11,760 –&gt; 00:04:15,600<br>So it’s sometimes frustrating watching these.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:15,600 –&gt; 00:04:19,280<br>You know that it turned the wrong way and it’s going to get trapped here, but the computer</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:19,280 –&gt; 00:04:21,280<br>doesn’t really know that.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:21,280 –&gt; 00:04:24,280<br>So it has to back up along here now.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:24,279 –&gt; 00:04:33,479<br>And it continues to back up to find another option until it gets free again and finds some</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:33,479 –&gt; 00:04:35,199<br>place to go.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:35,199 –&gt; 00:04:37,199<br>And sometimes it’s very frustrating.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:37,199 –&gt; 00:04:42,679<br>It seems to be quite close to the goal like up here and it turns the wrong way.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:42,679 –&gt; 00:04:48,559<br>So we can see it’s going to take a long way, but no way the program could really know that.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:49,040 –&gt; 00:04:57,280<br>Again, all the programs working with is vertex instead of edges associated with that vertex</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:57,280 –&gt; 00:05:00,280<br>and there it finally gets to the goal.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:00,280 –&gt; 00:05:03,280<br>Here’s a bigger one going faster.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:09,560 –&gt; 00:05:15,040<br>Now, the key thing is not so much getting lost and going the wrong way.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:15,040 –&gt; 00:05:19,000<br>The key thing is not going anywhere twice.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:19,000 –&gt; 00:05:20,000<br>That’s the whole thing.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:20,000 –&gt; 00:05:25,080<br>We have to have the string to know to go back where we came from and we have to be able to</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:25,080 –&gt; 00:05:27,600<br>mark where we’ve been.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:27,600 –&gt; 00:05:34,879<br>And with those two things we are, the algorithm is able to avoid going the same place twice.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:34,879 –&gt; 00:05:38,680<br>If you weren’t marking, if you try to do this randomly or some other way, it might take</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:38,680 –&gt; 00:05:40,920<br>you a while to get to the goal.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:40,920 –&gt; 00:05:48,520<br>So it doesn’t seem like much of accomplishment maybe for a maze, but actually to be able</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:48,520 –&gt; 00:05:57,120<br>to get there without going any place twice is sort of a profound idea and leads to an</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:57,120 –&gt; 00:05:59,120<br>efficient algorithm.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:59,120 –&gt; 00:06:08,400<br>Okay, so our idea is given in this medicode to do depth for search.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:08,399 –&gt; 00:06:13,959<br>That is to visit all the places you can get to from a vertex V.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:13,959 –&gt; 00:06:17,679<br>What we’re going to do is this simple recursive algorithm.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:17,679 –&gt; 00:06:24,560<br>Mark the vertex is visited and then recursively visit all on mark versus W that are adjacent</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:24,560 –&gt; 00:06:30,479<br>to V. That’s a very simple description and it leads to very simple code.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:30,479 –&gt; 00:06:37,959<br>It’s so simple actually it really belies the profound idea underneath this algorithm.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:38,839 –&gt; 00:06:45,799<br>So again, there’s lots of applications and for example, this is one way to find whether</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:45,799 –&gt; 00:06:51,560<br>there exists a path between two vertices or to find all the vertices connected to a given</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:51,560 –&gt; 00:06:52,560<br>source vertex.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:52,560 –&gt; 00:06:58,279<br>And we’ll consider some less abstract applications once we’ve looked at the code.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:58,279 –&gt; 00:07:01,279<br>So how to implement.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:01,279 –&gt; 00:07:07,120<br>Well, here’s what we’re going to do for our design pattern for graph processing.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:07,199 –&gt; 00:07:09,879<br>Our first example.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:09,879 –&gt; 00:07:20,199<br>So what we did when we defined an API for graphs was to decouple the graph data type from</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:20,199 –&gt; 00:07:22,319<br>graph processing.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:22,319 –&gt; 00:07:27,800<br>The idea is we’re going to create a graph object using that API which we know allows us</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:27,800 –&gt; 00:07:32,759<br>to represent a big graph within the computer and gives us the basic operations that we’re</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:32,759 –&gt; 00:07:35,159<br>going to need for graph processing.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:35,159 –&gt; 00:07:39,719<br>And then we use that API within a graph processing routine.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:39,719 –&gt; 00:07:45,159<br>And the basic idea is that that graph processing routine will go through the graph and collect</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:45,159 –&gt; 00:07:53,920<br>some information and then a client of that routine will query its API to get information</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:53,920 –&gt; 00:07:55,639<br>about the graph.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:55,639 –&gt; 00:08:04,639<br>So in the case of depth first search, here’s a potential possible API.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:04,639 –&gt; 00:08:12,639<br>So the idea is that what we’re going to implement is a program that can find paths in a graph</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:12,639 –&gt; 00:08:14,800<br>from a given source.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:14,800 –&gt; 00:08:22,079<br>So we give a graph and a vertex and that constructor is going to do what it needs in order to be</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:22,079 –&gt; 00:08:26,319<br>able to answer these two queries.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:26,319 –&gt; 00:08:34,679<br>First one is give a vertex, final give a vertex, is there a path in the graph from the source</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:34,679 –&gt; 00:08:35,679<br>to that vertex?</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:35,679 –&gt; 00:08:40,319<br>You want to be able to answer that efficiently.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:40,319 –&gt; 00:08:44,799<br>And then the other thing is to just give the path, what’s the path from S to V giving</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:44,799 –&gt; 00:08:49,759<br>me all the vertices on the path in time proportional to its length.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:49,759 –&gt; 00:08:55,120<br>So here’s a client of this API.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:55,120 –&gt; 00:09:03,439<br>So it’s going to take a source vertex S and it’s going to build a pathfinder or a path’s</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:03,439 –&gt; 00:09:04,840<br>object.</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:04,840 –&gt; 00:09:11,439<br>And that object is going to do the processing it needs to be able to efficiently implement</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:11,439 –&gt; 00:09:13,240<br>has path to.</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:13,240 –&gt; 00:09:19,519<br>And then what this does is for every vertex in the graph, if there’s a path from S to</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:19,519 –&gt; 00:09:22,360<br>that vertex, it’ll print it out.</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:22,360 –&gt; 00:09:25,399<br>So that prints out all the vertices connected to X.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:25,399 –&gt; 00:09:30,799<br>And that’s just one client of this data type.</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:30,799 –&gt; 00:09:35,680<br>You could print out the paths or whatever else you might.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:35,680 –&gt; 00:09:41,519<br>So that’s our design pattern that we’re going to use over and over again for a graph processing</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:41,519 –&gt; 00:09:42,519<br>routine.</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:42,519 –&gt; 00:09:47,960<br>And it’s important to understand why we use a design pattern like this.</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:47,960 –&gt; 00:09:52,679<br>We’re decoupling the graph representation from the processing of it.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:52,679 –&gt; 00:09:57,360<br>As I mentioned, there’s hundreds of routines for algorithms that have been developed for</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:57,360 –&gt; 00:09:59,159<br>processing graphs.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:59,159 –&gt; 00:10:03,559<br>An alternative might be to put all those algorithms in one big data type.</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:03,559 –&gt; 00:10:08,120<br>That’s a so-called fat interface.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:08,120 –&gt; 00:10:13,960<br>And that would be a bad plan because these things maybe are not so well related to each</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:13,960 –&gt; 00:10:20,480<br>other and actually all of them really are just iterating through the graph and doing different</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:20,480 –&gt; 00:10:22,320<br>types of processing.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:22,320 –&gt; 00:10:29,360<br>With this way, we’re able to separate out and articulate what the graph processing</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:29,360 –&gt; 00:10:30,919<br>clients are doing.</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:30,919 –&gt; 00:10:37,000<br>And then the real applications can be clients of these graph processing routines.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:37,000 –&gt; 00:10:43,200<br>And everybody’s taking advantage of an efficient representation that we already took care of.</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:43,200 –&gt; 00:10:50,360<br>OK, so now let’s look at a demo of how depth research is going to work and then we’ll take</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:50,360 –&gt; 00:10:53,399<br>a look at the implementation.</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:53,399 –&gt; 00:10:59,600<br>OK, so here’s a demo of depth research in operation on our sample graph.</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:59,600 –&gt; 00:11:05,440<br>Again, to visit a vertex, we’re going to mark it and then recursively visit all unmarked</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:05,440 –&gt; 00:11:08,640<br>vertices that are adjacent.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:08,640 –&gt; 00:11:11,360<br>So this is our sample graph.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:11,360 –&gt; 00:11:20,880<br>And so the first thing we do is realize that we’re going to need a vertex indexed array to keep track of which</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:20,880 –&gt; 00:11:22,360<br>vertices are marked.</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:22,360 –&gt; 00:11:29,040<br>So that’ll just be array of Boolean and we’ll initialize that with all false.</p>
<p>142<br>00:11:29,039 –&gt; 00:11:38,480<br>We’re also going to keep another data structured a vertex indexed array of ints that for every vertex</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:38,480 –&gt; 00:11:43,039<br>gives us the vertex that took us there.</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:43,039 –&gt; 00:11:46,919<br>So let’s get started and you’ll see how it works.</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:46,919 –&gt; 00:11:52,000<br>So this is the depth research starting at vertex 0.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:52,000 –&gt; 00:11:56,440<br>So now to visit vertex 0, we want to mark it.</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:56,440 –&gt; 00:12:03,080<br>So that’s mark 0 is true and that’s the starting point for you know anything with edge 2.</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:03,080 –&gt; 00:12:09,559<br>And now what we’re going to do is we’re going to need to check all the vertices that are adjacent to 0.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:09,559 –&gt; 00:12:12,600<br>So that’s 6, 2, 1, and 5.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:12,600 –&gt; 00:12:18,360<br>The order in which their check depends on the representation in the bag,</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:18,360 –&gt; 00:12:22,800<br>we don’t really necessarily care about that.</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:22,800 –&gt; 00:12:25,159<br>Most of the algorithms are going to check them all.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:25,159 –&gt; 00:12:27,240<br>It doesn’t matter that much about the order.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:27,240 –&gt; 00:12:36,960<br>Although in some cases it’s wise to be mindful and maybe use a bag that takes them out in random order.</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:36,960 –&gt; 00:12:41,399<br>OK, so to visit 0, we have to check 6, 2, 1, and 5.</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:41,399 –&gt; 00:12:43,879<br>So let’s go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:43,879 –&gt; 00:12:49,200<br>So in this case, 6 is the first thing to get checked.</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:49,200 –&gt; 00:12:58,799<br>And so now we mark 6 as visited and now we’re going to recursively do a search starting from 6.</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:58,799 –&gt; 00:13:07,399<br>The other difference when we visit 6 from 0, we’re going to put a 0 in this edge 2 entry to say that</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:07,399 –&gt; 00:13:12,879<br>when we first got to 6, the way we got there was from 0.</p>
<p>161<br>00:13:12,879 –&gt; 00:13:24,720<br>And that’s going to be the data structure that will help us implement the client query to give us the path back to 0 from any path from any vertex.</p>
<p>162<br>00:13:24,720 –&gt; 00:13:27,279<br>OK, so what do we have to do to visit 6?</p>
<p>163<br>00:13:27,279 –&gt; 00:13:33,360<br>Well, 6 has 2 adjacent vertices, 0 and 4, so we’re going to have to check them.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:33,360 –&gt; 00:13:37,039<br>So first we check 0 and that’s already marked.</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:37,039 –&gt; 00:13:39,079<br>So we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:39,079 –&gt; 00:13:43,240<br>We’re only supposed to recursively visit unmarked vertices.</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:43,240 –&gt; 00:13:45,679<br>And then we check 4.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:45,679 –&gt; 00:13:52,079<br>And 4 is unmarked, so we’re going to have to recursively visit it.</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:52,079 –&gt; 00:14:02,639<br>So next thing we do is visit 4, mark 4 as having been visited with a true in the marked array, fourth entry of the marked array.</p>
<p>170<br>00:14:02,639 –&gt; 00:14:07,519<br>And we fill an edge 2 saying we got to 4 from 6.</p>
<p>171<br>00:14:07,519 –&gt; 00:14:15,000<br>And so now to visit 4, we have to recursively check 5, 6, and 3.</p>
<p>172<br>00:14:15,000 –&gt; 00:14:18,840<br>And again, that order is where they happen to be in our bag.</p>
<p>173<br>00:14:18,840 –&gt; 00:14:20,759<br>So first we check 5.</p>
<p>174<br>00:14:20,759 –&gt; 00:14:24,240<br>5 is not marked, so we’re going to visit 5.</p>
<p>175<br>00:14:24,240 –&gt; 00:14:31,720<br>We’re going to mark it, say we got there from 4, and then go ahead and visit 3, 4, and 0 in that order.</p>
<p>176<br>00:14:31,720 –&gt; 00:14:36,800<br>From first we visit 3, that one also is not yet marked.</p>
<p>177<br>00:14:36,800 –&gt; 00:14:39,639<br>So we’re going to recursively visit it.</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:39,639 –&gt; 00:14:43,480<br>So that’s mark 3, say we got there from 5.</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:43,480 –&gt; 00:14:51,639<br>And then go ahead and to visit 3 recursively, we have to check 5 and 4.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:51,639 –&gt; 00:14:54,360<br>Check 5, while we just came there, it’s marked.</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:54,360 –&gt; 00:14:55,920<br>So we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:55,920 –&gt; 00:15:01,080<br>Check 4, that’s also been marked, so we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>183<br>00:15:01,120 –&gt; 00:15:06,320<br>So now finally, this is the first time in the recursive calls that we’re ready to return.</p>
<p>184<br>00:15:06,320 –&gt; 00:15:09,639<br>We’re done with that first search from 3.</p>
<p>185<br>00:15:09,639 –&gt; 00:15:13,400<br>So now we’re done with 3, and we can unwinding the recursion.</p>
<p>186<br>00:15:13,400 –&gt; 00:15:18,520<br>We can now continue our search from 5.</p>
<p>187<br>00:15:18,520 –&gt; 00:15:22,680<br>And the next thing we have to do from 5, we’ve already checked 3.</p>
<p>188<br>00:15:22,680 –&gt; 00:15:25,040<br>So now we’re going to check 4.</p>
<p>189<br>00:15:25,040 –&gt; 00:15:28,440<br>And we’ve already visited 4, so we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>190<br>00:15:28,440 –&gt; 00:15:30,120<br>That’s already marked.</p>
<p>191<br>00:15:30,120 –&gt; 00:15:32,400<br>And we check 0, and that one’s already marked.</p>
<p>192<br>00:15:32,400 –&gt; 00:15:37,360<br>So now we’re done with 5, and we can back one more level up in the recursion.</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:37,360 –&gt; 00:15:43,400<br>So now for 4, we have to go through and look at 6 and 3.</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:43,400 –&gt; 00:15:46,280<br>6 is marked, so we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>195<br>00:15:46,280 –&gt; 00:15:49,760<br>3 is marked, so we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>196<br>00:15:49,760 –&gt; 00:15:52,600<br>And so we’re going to be done with 4.</p>
<p>197<br>00:15:52,600 –&gt; 00:15:57,840<br>So after finishing 4, we’re done with 6.</p>
<p>198<br>00:15:57,840 –&gt; 00:16:02,480<br>And so now we’re in the recursion back at 0.</p>
<p>199<br>00:16:02,480 –&gt; 00:16:04,240<br>We’ve already checked 6.</p>
<p>200<br>00:16:04,240 –&gt; 00:16:06,480<br>So now we’ve got to check 2 next.</p>
<p>201<br>00:16:06,480 –&gt; 00:16:11,440<br>We check 2, and so we recurse and go there, marked 2.</p>
<p>202<br>00:16:11,440 –&gt; 00:16:14,160<br>And then say we got there from 0.</p>
<p>203<br>00:16:14,160 –&gt; 00:16:18,080<br>And now to visit 2, all we check is 0, and that’s marked.</p>
<p>204<br>00:16:18,080 –&gt; 00:16:19,200<br>So we don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p>205<br>00:16:19,200 –&gt; 00:16:21,240<br>And we’re done with 2.</p>
<p>206<br>00:16:21,240 –&gt; 00:16:23,000<br>And then check 1.</p>
<p>207<br>00:16:23,000 –&gt; 00:16:24,360<br>Visit 1.</p>
<p>208<br>00:16:24,360 –&gt; 00:16:26,160<br>That’s the last vertex we’re visiting.</p>
<p>209<br>00:16:28,440 –&gt; 00:16:29,960<br>Check 0.</p>
<p>210<br>00:16:29,960 –&gt; 00:16:32,440<br>It’s already marked, so we don’t do anything.</p>
<p>211<br>00:16:32,440 –&gt; 00:16:34,080<br>We returned.</p>
<p>212<br>00:16:34,080 –&gt; 00:16:38,600<br>And now we’re at the last step is from 0.</p>
<p>213<br>00:16:38,600 –&gt; 00:16:39,720<br>5 is on its list.</p>
<p>214<br>00:16:39,720 –&gt; 00:16:41,840<br>We have to check if we’ve been there.</p>
<p>215<br>00:16:41,840 –&gt; 00:16:44,480<br>We can see that it’s marked, and we have been there.</p>
<p>216<br>00:16:44,480 –&gt; 00:16:47,360<br>So we’re done with 0.</p>
<p>217<br>00:16:47,360 –&gt; 00:16:53,080<br>So that’s a depth first search from vertex 0.</p>
<p>218<br>00:16:53,080 –&gt; 00:16:56,560<br>And we have visited all the vertices that</p>
<p>219<br>00:16:56,560 –&gt; 00:16:59,040<br>are reachable from 0.</p>
<p>220<br>00:16:59,040 –&gt; 00:17:02,720<br>Number 1, and number 2, for each one of those vertices,</p>
<p>221<br>00:17:02,720 –&gt; 00:17:07,200<br>we kept track of how we got there from 0.</p>
<p>222<br>00:17:07,200 –&gt; 00:17:10,319<br>So if we now want to know for any one of those vertices,</p>
<p>223<br>00:17:10,319 –&gt; 00:17:14,200<br>how to get back to 0, we have the information that we need.</p>
<p>224<br>00:17:14,200 –&gt; 00:17:20,319<br>For example, say we want to find the path from 5 back to 0.</p>
<p>225<br>00:17:20,319 –&gt; 00:17:22,480<br>We know we got to 5 from 4.</p>
<p>226<br>00:17:22,480 –&gt; 00:17:24,519<br>We know we got to 4 from 6.</p>
<p>227<br>00:17:24,519 –&gt; 00:17:27,559<br>We know we got to 6 from 0.</p>
<p>228<br>00:17:27,559 –&gt; 00:17:31,839<br>So we can go back through using that edge to array</p>
<p>229<br>00:17:31,839 –&gt; 00:17:33,839<br>to find the path.</p>
<p>230<br>00:17:33,839 –&gt; 00:17:35,980<br>So the depth first search calculation</p>
<p>231<br>00:17:35,980 –&gt; 00:17:37,599<br>built these data structures.</p>
<p>232<br>00:17:37,599 –&gt; 00:17:43,120<br>And now clients, these data structures built in the constructor</p>
<p>233<br>00:17:43,120 –&gt; 00:17:49,640<br>serve as the basis for being able to efficiently answer</p>
<p>234<br>00:17:49,640 –&gt; 00:17:51,319<br>client queries.</p>
<p>235<br>00:17:51,319 –&gt; 00:17:54,119<br>That’s a depth first search demo.</p>
<p>236<br>00:17:54,119 –&gt; 00:17:56,879<br>So this is just a summary of the things</p>
<p>237<br>00:17:56,879 –&gt; 00:17:59,679<br>I talked about during that demo.</p>
<p>238<br>00:17:59,679 –&gt; 00:18:02,759<br>Our goal is to find all the vertices connected</p>
<p>239<br>00:18:02,759 –&gt; 00:18:07,000<br>to a given vertex s and also a path</p>
<p>240<br>00:18:07,000 –&gt; 00:18:09,879<br>in order to be able to answer client query.</p>
<p>241<br>00:18:09,879 –&gt; 00:18:11,679<br>And the algorithm we’re going to use</p>
<p>242<br>00:18:11,679 –&gt; 00:18:16,679<br>is based on like maze exploration, where we use recursion.</p>
<p>243<br>00:18:16,679 –&gt; 00:18:19,119<br>Mark each vertex, keep track of the edge.</p>
<p>244<br>00:18:19,119 –&gt; 00:18:24,039<br>We took to visit it and return when there’s no unvisited option.</p>
<p>245<br>00:18:24,039 –&gt; 00:18:28,599<br>We’re using two data structures to implement this.</p>
<p>246<br>00:18:28,599 –&gt; 00:18:32,239<br>Both vertex indexed arrays, one named</p>
<p>247<br>00:18:32,239 –&gt; 00:18:35,959<br>marked that will tell us which vertices we’ve been to.</p>
<p>248<br>00:18:35,959 –&gt; 00:18:41,519<br>And another one, edge two, that maintains the tree of path,</p>
<p>249<br>00:18:41,519 –&gt; 00:18:46,039<br>where edge two w equals v means the vw was taken</p>
<p>250<br>00:18:46,039 –&gt; 00:18:48,559<br>the first time that we went to w.</p>
<p>251<br>00:18:48,559 –&gt; 00:18:49,879<br>So now let’s look at the code.</p>
<p>252<br>00:18:49,879 –&gt; 00:18:53,480<br>Given all this background, the code for implementing depth</p>
<p>253<br>00:18:53,480 –&gt; 00:18:57,039<br>for search is remarkably compact.</p>
<p>254<br>00:18:57,039 –&gt; 00:18:59,639<br>So here’s our private instance variables,</p>
<p>255<br>00:18:59,639 –&gt; 00:19:03,200<br>the marked an edge two vertex indexed arrays in the source</p>
<p>256<br>00:19:03,200 –&gt; 00:19:04,559<br>s.</p>
<p>257<br>00:19:04,559 –&gt; 00:19:08,919<br>And the constructor just goes through and creates the arrays</p>
<p>258<br>00:19:08,919 –&gt; 00:19:10,319<br>and initializes them.</p>
<p>259<br>00:19:10,319 –&gt; 00:19:12,919<br>We won’t repeat that code.</p>
<p>260<br>00:19:12,919 –&gt; 00:19:17,839<br>And so here’s the last thing the constructor does</p>
<p>261<br>00:19:17,839 –&gt; 00:19:22,159<br>after it creates the arrays is does a DFS on the graph</p>
<p>262<br>00:19:22,159 –&gt; 00:19:24,439<br>from the given source.</p>
<p>263<br>00:19:24,439 –&gt; 00:19:29,119<br>And it’s a remarkably compact implementation</p>
<p>264<br>00:19:29,119 –&gt; 00:19:33,359<br>to do depth for search from a vertex v.</p>
<p>265<br>00:19:33,359 –&gt; 00:19:36,959<br>What we do is mark v, that’s it marked to true.</p>
<p>266<br>00:19:36,959 –&gt; 00:19:42,039<br>And for everybody adjacent to v, we check if it’s marked.</p>
<p>267<br>00:19:42,039 –&gt; 00:19:46,359<br>If it’s not marked, then we do a recursive call.</p>
<p>268<br>00:19:46,359 –&gt; 00:19:50,879<br>And we set edge to w equals v.</p>
<p>269<br>00:19:50,879 –&gt; 00:19:55,479<br>Again, remarkably compact code that gets the job done.</p>
<p>270<br>00:19:58,479 –&gt; 00:20:00,759<br>So now let’s look at some of the properties of depth</p>
<p>271<br>00:20:00,759 –&gt; 00:20:02,000<br>for search.</p>
<p>272<br>00:20:02,000 –&gt; 00:20:06,279<br>So first thing is we want to be sure</p>
<p>273<br>00:20:06,279 –&gt; 00:20:11,319<br>that convinced ourselves that it marks all the vertices connected</p>
<p>274<br>00:20:11,319 –&gt; 00:20:15,279<br>to s in time proportional to some of their degrees,</p>
<p>275<br>00:20:15,279 –&gt; 00:20:18,559<br>which first bar is graph is going to be small.</p>
<p>276<br>00:20:18,559 –&gt; 00:20:23,119<br>So first thing is convince yourself</p>
<p>277<br>00:20:23,119 –&gt; 00:20:25,599<br>that if you mark the vertex, then there</p>
<p>278<br>00:20:25,599 –&gt; 00:20:29,799<br>has to be a way to get to that vertex from s.</p>
<p>279<br>00:20:29,799 –&gt; 00:20:33,440<br>And so well, that’s easy to see because the only way</p>
<p>280<br>00:20:33,440 –&gt; 00:20:37,200<br>to mark a vertex is get there through a sequence of recursive</p>
<p>281<br>00:20:37,200 –&gt; 00:20:40,039<br>calls and every recursive call corresponds</p>
<p>282<br>00:20:40,039 –&gt; 00:20:43,639<br>to an edge on a path from s to w.</p>
<p>283<br>00:20:43,640 –&gt; 00:20:45,360<br>But you also have to be able to show</p>
<p>284<br>00:20:45,360 –&gt; 00:20:50,040<br>that you get to every vertex that’s connected to s.</p>
<p>285<br>00:20:50,040 –&gt; 00:20:51,680<br>And that’s a little more intricate.</p>
<p>286<br>00:20:51,680 –&gt; 00:20:55,240<br>And this diagram is supposed to help you out</p>
<p>287<br>00:20:55,240 –&gt; 00:20:57,680<br>in understanding that.</p>
<p>288<br>00:20:57,680 –&gt; 00:21:04,360<br>If you had some unmarked vertex, then maybe there’s</p>
<p>289<br>00:21:04,360 –&gt; 00:21:07,040<br>a bunch of unmarked vertices.</p>
<p>290<br>00:21:07,040 –&gt; 00:21:11,000<br>And so in its connected s and it’s not marked,</p>
<p>291<br>00:21:11,000 –&gt; 00:21:16,839<br>that means there has to be an edge on a path from s to w</p>
<p>292<br>00:21:16,839 –&gt; 00:21:20,960<br>that goes from a marked vertex to an unmarked one.</p>
<p>293<br>00:21:20,960 –&gt; 00:21:24,680<br>But the design of the algorithm says that there’s no such edge.</p>
<p>294<br>00:21:24,680 –&gt; 00:21:27,200<br>If you’re on a marked vertex, then you’re</p>
<p>295<br>00:21:27,200 –&gt; 00:21:29,599<br>going to go through and look at all the adjacent ones.</p>
<p>296<br>00:21:29,599 –&gt; 00:21:32,079<br>And if it’s not marked, you’re going to mark it.</p>
<p>297<br>00:21:32,079 –&gt; 00:21:39,240<br>So that’s an outline of the proof that DFS marks all the vertices.</p>
<p>298<br>00:21:39,240 –&gt; 00:21:42,640<br>And in the running time, it only visits each marked vertex</p>
<p>299<br>00:21:42,640 –&gt; 00:21:44,880<br>once or each vertex connected to s once.</p>
<p>300<br>00:21:44,880 –&gt; 00:21:48,400<br>And so for each one of them, it goes</p>
<p>301<br>00:21:48,400 –&gt; 00:21:49,880<br>through all the adjacent vertices.</p>
<p>302<br>00:21:49,880 –&gt; 00:21:56,200<br>So that’s the basic properties of depth research.</p>
<p>303<br>00:21:56,200 –&gt; 00:22:00,960<br>So now the other thing that is important</p>
<p>304<br>00:22:00,960 –&gt; 00:22:08,400<br>is that a client who uses this algorithm</p>
<p>305<br>00:22:08,400 –&gt; 00:22:10,840<br>after the depth research, after the constructor</p>
<p>306<br>00:22:10,840 –&gt; 00:22:14,160<br>has done the depth research and built these data structures,</p>
<p>307<br>00:22:14,160 –&gt; 00:22:17,080<br>client can find the vertices connected</p>
<p>308<br>00:22:17,080 –&gt; 00:22:22,560<br>to the source in constant time and can find a path to s</p>
<p>309<br>00:22:22,560 –&gt; 00:22:25,519<br>if one exists in time proportion to its length.</p>
<p>310<br>00:22:25,519 –&gt; 00:22:29,040<br>Well, the marked array provides the first part.</p>
<p>311<br>00:22:29,040 –&gt; 00:22:37,680<br>And the second part is just a property of the edge</p>
<p>312<br>00:22:37,680 –&gt; 00:22:39,720<br>to array.</p>
<p>313<br>00:22:39,720 –&gt; 00:22:43,160<br>It’s a what’s called a parent-length representation</p>
<p>314<br>00:22:43,160 –&gt; 00:22:45,960<br>of a tree rooted at s.</p>
<p>315<br>00:22:45,960 –&gt; 00:22:49,400<br>So if a vertex is connected to s, then it’s</p>
<p>316<br>00:22:49,400 –&gt; 00:22:52,759<br>edge to its parent in the tree.</p>
<p>317<br>00:22:52,759 –&gt; 00:22:59,080<br>So this code here is going to for a given well-haz path</p>
<p>318<br>00:22:59,080 –&gt; 00:23:02,200<br>to, so that’s just returned marked as the first part.</p>
<p>319<br>00:23:02,200 –&gt; 00:23:06,640<br>And then to actually get the path to a given vertex.</p>
<p>320<br>00:23:06,640 –&gt; 00:23:09,680<br>So here’s the code for doing that.</p>
<p>321<br>00:23:09,680 –&gt; 00:23:12,880<br>We actually use a stack to keep track of the path</p>
<p>322<br>00:23:12,880 –&gt; 00:23:15,680<br>because we get it in reverse order.</p>
<p>323<br>00:23:15,680 –&gt; 00:23:18,840<br>If there’s no path, we return null.</p>
<p>324<br>00:23:18,840 –&gt; 00:23:21,640<br>Otherwise, we keep a variable x.</p>
<p>325<br>00:23:21,640 –&gt; 00:23:25,960<br>And we just follow up through the edge to array,</p>
<p>326<br>00:23:25,960 –&gt; 00:23:30,160<br>pushing the vertex onto the stack,</p>
<p>327<br>00:23:30,160 –&gt; 00:23:33,560<br>and then moving up the tree in the array,</p>
<p>328<br>00:23:33,560 –&gt; 00:23:36,160<br>then finally push s itself onto the path.</p>
<p>329<br>00:23:36,160 –&gt; 00:23:39,040<br>And then we have a stack, which is interval, which</p>
<p>330<br>00:23:39,040 –&gt; 00:23:41,480<br>will give us our path.</p>
<p>331<br>00:23:41,480 –&gt; 00:23:46,840<br>So that’s in time proportional to the length of the path.</p>
<p>332<br>00:23:46,840 –&gt; 00:23:49,720<br>And it’s worthwhile to check your understanding</p>
<p>333<br>00:23:49,720 –&gt; 00:23:52,800<br>of how stacks and iterator works, iterator’s work,</p>
<p>334<br>00:23:52,800 –&gt; 00:23:58,120<br>to take a look at this code to see that it does the job.</p>
<p>335<br>00:23:58,120 –&gt; 00:24:00,800<br>So that’s depth for search.</p>
<p>336<br>00:24:00,799 –&gt; 00:24:06,039<br>Now, it’s not the optimal graph searching method</p>
<p>337<br>00:24:06,039 –&gt; 00:24:08,119<br>for all applications.</p>
<p>338<br>00:24:08,119 –&gt; 00:24:12,000<br>And here’s an amusing representation</p>
<p>339<br>00:24:12,000 –&gt; 00:24:16,759<br>of how depth for search can maybe create problems sometimes.</p>
<p>340<br>00:24:16,759 –&gt; 00:24:18,639<br>So I’m getting ready for a date.</p>
<p>341<br>00:24:18,639 –&gt; 00:24:21,519<br>What situations do I prepare for?</p>
<p>342<br>00:24:21,519 –&gt; 00:24:24,000<br>Well, medical emergency, dancing, food,</p>
<p>343<br>00:24:24,000 –&gt; 00:24:25,759<br>too expensive.</p>
<p>344<br>00:24:25,759 –&gt; 00:24:28,519<br>OK, what kind of medical emergencies could happen?</p>
<p>345<br>00:24:28,519 –&gt; 00:24:31,160<br>Well, it could be snake bite or a lightning strike</p>
<p>346<br>00:24:31,160 –&gt; 00:24:32,960<br>or fall from a chair.</p>
<p>347<br>00:24:32,960 –&gt; 00:24:34,639<br>Well, what about snakes?</p>
<p>348<br>00:24:34,639 –&gt; 00:24:37,079<br>I have to worry about cornstakes or garter</p>
<p>349<br>00:24:37,079 –&gt; 00:24:39,200<br>snakes or crop or head.</p>
<p>350<br>00:24:39,200 –&gt; 00:24:41,240<br>And then, well, I would have better make a strut</p>
<p>351<br>00:24:41,240 –&gt; 00:24:44,000<br>and I would have better study snakes.</p>
<p>352<br>00:24:44,000 –&gt; 00:24:46,400<br>And then the date says, I’m here to pick you up.</p>
<p>353<br>00:24:46,400 –&gt; 00:24:48,440<br>You’re not dressed.</p>
<p>354<br>00:24:48,440 –&gt; 00:24:53,720<br>And well, so I really need to stop using depth for search.</p>
<p>355<br>00:24:53,720 –&gt; 00:24:57,400<br>So we’re going to look at other graph searching algorithms.</p>
<p>356<br>00:24:57,400 –&gt; 00:25:02,040<br>But if you always try to expand the next thing</p>
<p>357<br>00:25:02,040 –&gt; 00:25:04,120<br>that you come to, that’s depth for search.</p>
<p>358<br>00:25:04,120 –&gt; 00:25:06,560<br>And there’s a lot of natural situations</p>
<p>359<br>00:25:06,560 –&gt; 00:25:09,759<br>where that naturally comes to mind.</p>
<p>360<br>00:25:09,759 –&gt; 00:25:11,360<br>Here’s another example.</p>
<p>361<br>00:25:11,360 –&gt; 00:25:14,440<br>I took this photo of the Taj Mahal a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>362<br>00:25:14,440 –&gt; 00:25:17,920<br>And I didn’t like the color of the sky.</p>
<p>363<br>00:25:17,920 –&gt; 00:25:23,280<br>So I used Photoshop’s magic wand to make it more blue</p>
<p>364<br>00:25:23,280 –&gt; 00:25:24,920<br>in the implementation.</p>
<p>365<br>00:25:24,920 –&gt; 00:25:26,519<br>Now, this is a huge graph.</p>
<p>366<br>00:25:26,519 –&gt; 00:25:29,480<br>The pictures got millions of pixels.</p>
<p>367<br>00:25:29,480 –&gt; 00:25:34,279<br>And the way that the flood filled the magic wand works</p>
<p>368<br>00:25:34,279 –&gt; 00:25:37,799<br>is to build from a photo, what’s called a grid graph,</p>
<p>369<br>00:25:37,799 –&gt; 00:25:40,599<br>where every vertex is a pixel.</p>
<p>370<br>00:25:40,599 –&gt; 00:25:44,319<br>And every edge connects to pixels</p>
<p>371<br>00:25:44,319 –&gt; 00:25:47,519<br>that are the same color or approximately the same color.</p>
<p>372<br>00:25:47,519 –&gt; 00:25:50,359<br>And it builds a blob of all the pixels that</p>
<p>373<br>00:25:50,359 –&gt; 00:25:53,039<br>have the same color as a given pixel.</p>
<p>374<br>00:25:53,039 –&gt; 00:25:55,759<br>So when I click on one, it does a depth for search</p>
<p>375<br>00:25:55,759 –&gt; 00:25:59,079<br>to find all the connected pixels.</p>
<p>376<br>00:25:59,079 –&gt; 00:26:02,759<br>And there are four change them to the new color.</p>
<p>377<br>00:26:02,759 –&gt; 00:26:05,279<br>That’s a fine example of depth for search</p>
<p>378<br>00:26:05,279 –&gt; 00:26:09,640<br>on a huge graph that people use every day.</p>
<p>379<br>00:26:09,640 –&gt; 00:26:12,079<br>So that’s our first non-trivial graph processing</p>
<p>380<br>00:26:12,079 –&gt; 00:26:14,720<br>algorithm, depth for search.</p>
