                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:12,560<br>As our final die graph processing algorithm, we’ll take a look at computing strong components.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:12,560 –&gt; 00:00:19,800<br>So definition two vertices, V and W in a die graph, are strongly connected if there’s</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:19,800 –&gt; 00:00:26,839<br>a directed path from V to W and another directed path from W to V. And the thing about strongly</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:26,839 –&gt; 00:00:33,799<br>connected is that it’s an equivalence relation. That is, each vertex is strongly connected</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:33,799 –&gt; 00:00:42,039<br>to itself. If V is connected to W strongly and W is strongly connected to V, that just</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:42,039 –&gt; 00:00:47,640<br>means this direct path is connecting them. And it’s also transitive. If V is connected</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:47,640 –&gt; 00:00:55,120<br>to W and W to X, then V is strongly connected to X. To get from V to X, you go from V to</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:55,119 –&gt; 00:01:03,000<br>W and W to X, you get from X to V, you go from X to W and W to V. So that means that since</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:03,000 –&gt; 00:01:09,239<br>it’s an equivalence relation, it divides the die graph up into components, into sets,</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:09,239 –&gt; 00:01:14,840<br>called strongly connected components, that have the property that there’s directed paths</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:14,840 –&gt; 00:01:24,439<br>connecting each pair of vertices in the set. So for example, nine in 12 are strongly connected</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:24,439 –&gt; 00:01:34,280<br>as a path from 12 to 9, another one from 9 to 12 and so forth. So our challenge is to compute</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:34,280 –&gt; 00:01:44,039<br>the strong components in die graphs. And it’s worth comparing this to what we did for</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:44,039 –&gt; 00:01:51,799<br>connected components in undirected graphs. So this is just a quick review in an undirected</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:51,799 –&gt; 00:01:56,359<br>graph. If there’s a path between two vertices, they’re connected, that’s an equivalence relation,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:56,359 –&gt; 00:02:05,359<br>divides them up into connected components. And what we did was our design pattern is to build</p>
<p>17<br>00:02:05,359 –&gt; 00:02:11,960<br>our graph processing algorithm as a constructor that takes a graph and does the pre-processing</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:11,960 –&gt; 00:02:19,719<br>to create a table like this one, which assigns a unique ID to all the vertices in each given</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:19,719 –&gt; 00:02:27,520<br>component so that we can have a constant time client query to check whether two given vertices</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:27,520 –&gt; 00:02:34,000<br>are in the same connected component or not. So linear time processing, pre-processing in the</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:34,000 –&gt; 00:02:41,879<br>constructor to build the table constant time client queries. And that’s as good performance as we</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:41,879 –&gt; 00:02:48,759<br>could expect to have for a graph processing algorithm. Remarkably, we’re able to do the same</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:48,759 –&gt; 00:02:57,159<br>thing for strong connectivity. It’s a much more sophisticated algorithm, but the design pattern</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:57,159 –&gt; 00:03:03,639<br>in the bottom line for the client is the same. There’s a constructor that processes the graph in</p>
<p>25<br>00:03:03,639 –&gt; 00:03:10,439<br>linear time and it signs a unique ID to each one of the strongly connected components in the graph.</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:10,599 –&gt; 00:03:19,079<br>So one’s in a component by itself, 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, and 8, 7, and 9, 10, and 12. There’s five</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:19,079 –&gt; 00:03:24,759<br>different strongly connected components in this graph. The constructor builds that array and the</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:24,759 –&gt; 00:03:33,079<br>client gets to in constant time, whether two vertices are strongly connected or not. It’s quite</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:33,080 –&gt; 00:03:40,440<br>amazing that we can solve this problem in this way. And as I mentioned, it’s got an interesting</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:40,440 –&gt; 00:03:47,240<br>history that I’ll talk about in a second. So here’s an example of strong component application.</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:47,240 –&gt; 00:03:55,240<br>So the food-wed graph, this is a very small subset of that graph. The vertices are all the species</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:56,200 –&gt; 00:04:05,640<br>and an edge goes from producer to consumer. So if an animal A eats animal B, there’s an edge from A to B.</p>
<p>33<br>00:04:06,760 –&gt; 00:04:14,280<br>And what a strong component corresponds to in this graph is kind of a subset of species that</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:14,280 –&gt; 00:04:21,960<br>have a common energy flow. They mutually eat each other. And that’s extremely important in ecological</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:21,959 –&gt; 00:04:32,439<br>studies. Another example is, again, in processing software, big software is made up of modules.</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:33,319 –&gt; 00:04:42,519<br>And the vertices are the modules and the edges if one depends on another. And so a strong</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:42,519 –&gt; 00:04:50,279<br>component in this graph is a subset of mutually interacting modules. In a huge program like internet</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:50,279 –&gt; 00:04:55,719<br>explorer, you want to know what the strong components are so that you can package them together</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:56,439 –&gt; 00:05:05,639<br>and maybe improve the design. So again, these graphs can be huge. And this kind of graph processing</p>
<p>40<br>00:05:05,639 –&gt; 00:05:14,839<br>can be extremely important in improving the design of software. Now again, this algorithm has</p>
<p>41<br>00:05:14,919 –&gt; 00:05:21,399<br>an interesting history, along with scheduling and other things. It’s a core problem in operations</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:21,399 –&gt; 00:05:30,120<br>research that was widely studied but really not understood how difficult it was. In Targets paper</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:30,120 –&gt; 00:05:39,879<br>in 1972 was a big surprise that this could be solved in a linear time with depth for search.</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:40,439 –&gt; 00:05:48,120<br>Now, this algorithm had a couple of other data structures and is, I guess, a diligent student in</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:48,120 –&gt; 00:05:55,399<br>this class could understand it with quite a bit of work. But it really demonstrated the importance</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:55,399 –&gt; 00:06:02,199<br>of depth for search in graph processing. Now, the algorithm that we’re going to talk about today</p>
<p>47<br>00:06:02,759 –&gt; 00:06:11,639<br>actually was invented in the 80s by Kossaraju independently by Shireer. The story goes that Kossaraju</p>
<p>48<br>00:06:12,519 –&gt; 00:06:18,680<br>had to go lecture about Targets’ algorithm and he forgot his notes and he had taught it a number</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:18,680 –&gt; 00:06:24,199<br>of times. He was trying to figure out what Targets’ algorithm did and he developed this other</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:24,199 –&gt; 00:06:30,360<br>algorithm that’s extremely simple to implement. That’s what we’re going to look at today.</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:31,319 –&gt; 00:06:42,040<br>And actually, in the 1990s, Gebao and Melhorn, particularly Melhorn, had to implement this algorithm</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:42,840 –&gt; 00:06:50,360<br>for a big software package and I found another simple linear time algorithm. So this story</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:50,360 –&gt; 00:06:57,960<br>indicates even from fundamental problems in graph processing, there’s algorithms out there</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:57,959 –&gt; 00:07:05,399<br>still waiting to be discovered. This algorithm is a good example of that. So I get the intuition</p>
<p>55<br>00:07:05,399 –&gt; 00:07:10,599<br>in the code and you see how the algorithm works. Fully convincing yourself or approving</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:11,959 –&gt; 00:07:18,679<br>why it works is a bit more of a challenge. We’ll leave that mostly for the book. But let’s describe</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:18,679 –&gt; 00:07:27,639<br>what it is. So the first idea is to think about the reverse graph. So if we take a graph and we</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:27,639 –&gt; 00:07:33,000<br>reverse the sense of all the edges, we’re going to get the same strong components. We need edges</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:33,000 –&gt; 00:07:37,560<br>in both directions. So if we switch the directions, we’re still going to have edges in both directions.</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:39,240 –&gt; 00:07:47,719<br>The second concept is called the kernel DAG. And what that does is it kind of, you think about</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:48,360 –&gt; 00:07:55,319<br>contracting each strong component into a single vertex and then just worry about the edges that</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:56,040 –&gt; 00:08:07,000<br>go from one strong component to another. So the digraph that you get that way turns out to be a</p>
<p>63<br>00:08:07,000 –&gt; 00:08:15,560<br>cyclic. If it was cyclic, it would involve, it would create a bigger strong component,</p>
<p>64<br>00:08:15,560 –&gt; 00:08:24,519<br>a couple of strong components into one. So we think about that processing that kernel DAG,</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:24,519 –&gt; 00:08:31,319<br>that’s the edges that go between strong components. And we get a DAG and we know how to deal with a</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:31,319 –&gt; 00:08:40,600<br>DAG. So the idea of the algorithm is to go ahead and compute the topological order or the reverse</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:40,600 –&gt; 00:08:49,720<br>post order in the kernel DAG. At least put out the edges of the original digraph in order so that</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:49,720 –&gt; 00:08:55,000<br>all the edges in the kernel DAG point from right to left. That’s like a topological sort.</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:56,120 –&gt; 00:09:03,560<br>And then we run DFS, but instead of considering the vertices in numerical order for the DFS,</p>
<p>70<br>00:09:03,560 –&gt; 00:09:11,240<br>we consider them in that reverse topological order. So it’s extremely easy to implement this algorithm.</p>
<p>71<br>00:09:11,240 –&gt; 00:09:20,200<br>So of course we’re going to use DFS. So let’s look at a demo at how the algorithm works.</p>
<p>72<br>00:09:24,200 –&gt; 00:09:29,720<br>Okay, so this is a diagram and our goal is to compute the strong components. And we’re going to do it in</p>
<p>73<br>00:09:29,720 –&gt; 00:09:37,159<br>two phases, two DFSs. One is to compute the reverse post order in the reverse of the graph.</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:38,039 –&gt; 00:09:43,719<br>And the other is to run the DFS, but for the order in which we visit the vertices, we use</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:44,279 –&gt; 00:09:52,439<br>that reverse post order that we compute it. So here goes. So first we’ll do the DFS in the reverse graph.</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:54,360 –&gt; 00:10:01,559<br>So that’s the graph. That’s the reverse graph. Remember these two have the same strong components.</p>
<p>77<br>00:10:02,519 –&gt; 00:10:08,759<br>So there’s our marked array. We do the DFS and reverse post order means that when we’re done with</p>
<p>78<br>00:10:08,759 –&gt; 00:10:21,639<br>the vertex, we put it out. So check six on mark, check eight on mark, check six, it’s marked. So we’re</p>
<p>79<br>00:10:21,639 –&gt; 00:10:27,639<br>done with eight. And so that’s the reverse post order. And again, as before, we put it on a stack,</p>
<p>80<br>00:10:28,600 –&gt; 00:10:38,199<br>but we’ll just list them in reverse order in this demo. So each done, so six, lots of places to go from six.</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:39,000 –&gt; 00:10:45,480<br>So let’s check seven. That’s unmarked. So we go to seven. No place to go from seven. So we’re done</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:45,480 –&gt; 00:10:52,200<br>with seven. We put it on the reverse post order list. We’re also done with six, because four and</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:52,200 –&gt; 00:11:00,840<br>nine are coming in in this example. So put it on the list. Next place to go from zero is two. So we</p>
<p>84<br>00:11:00,840 –&gt; 00:11:09,400<br>check two. That’s unmarked. So we mark it in reverse and we check the vertices adjacent to two.</p>
<p>85<br>00:11:10,200 –&gt; 00:11:19,720<br>First four, that’s unmarked. So we go to four. We got to go to 11 first in reverse. So now we’re at 11.</p>
<p>86<br>00:11:19,720 –&gt; 00:11:28,120<br>And from 11, we go to nine, which is unmarked. So we have a pretty long recursive stack right here.</p>
<p>87<br>00:11:29,000 –&gt; 00:11:36,200<br>So from nine, we have to check a bunch of things. We’ll check 12 first. And then visit 12. It’s unmarked.</p>
<p>88<br>00:11:37,160 –&gt; 00:11:43,560<br>From 12, we check 11, which is marked. Now we’re at a go. Then we check 10. That’s unmarked. So we go to 10.</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:44,519 –&gt; 00:11:50,759<br>Visit 10. It’s unmarked. So we’re a recurs. And then go to nine.</p>
<p>90<br>00:11:52,119 –&gt; 00:11:57,079<br>And that’s marked. And that’s everywhere we get from 10. So we’re done with 10. So we put it on the list</p>
<p>91<br>00:11:58,199 –&gt; 00:12:05,000<br>in return. And now we’re done with 12. So we put it on the list in return. And now at nine, we have to</p>
<p>92<br>00:12:05,000 –&gt; 00:12:10,199<br>check seven, which is marked and six, which is marked. And then we’re done. So we put it on the list.</p>
<p>93<br>00:12:11,160 –&gt; 00:12:17,480<br>Then we’re done with 11. We put it on the list. Then we’re finished with four. So we check six, which is marked.</p>
<p>94<br>00:12:17,480 –&gt; 00:12:25,080<br>And we check five, which is unmarked. So we recurse to five. From five, we check three, which is unmarked.</p>
<p>95<br>00:12:25,080 –&gt; 00:12:32,120<br>So we recurse. Then we check four, which is marked. We check two, which is marked. And then we’re done with three.</p>
<p>96<br>00:12:32,120 –&gt; 00:12:39,720<br>So we put it on the list. And then from five, we check zero. It’s marked. So we’re done with five.</p>
<p>97<br>00:12:39,720 –&gt; 00:12:48,759<br>We put on the list. And that means that we’re now done with four. And then we’re also done with two.</p>
<p>98<br>00:12:49,560 –&gt; 00:12:59,080<br>After checking three. And then we go to zero and put it on the list. So that’s all the vertices that</p>
<p>99<br>00:12:59,080 –&gt; 00:13:06,040<br>you get to from zero. So we look for more vertices. And it’s one in its mark. So that’s the last one in</p>
<p>100<br>00:13:06,040 –&gt; 00:13:12,680<br>the reverse post order. So that’s a reverse post order of the reverse graph. And all we’re going to do is</p>
<p>101<br>00:13:12,680 –&gt; 00:13:20,680<br>take that order and use that order to check vertices at the top level in the depth first search of our</p>
<p>102<br>00:13:20,680 –&gt; 00:13:26,280<br>regular graph. We have to check all the other vertices to make sure we’re done. So that’s phase one.</p>
<p>103<br>00:13:27,159 –&gt; 00:13:32,439<br>So now we just do a DFS in the original graph using that order that we just compute it.</p>
<p>104<br>00:13:32,439 –&gt; 00:13:40,120<br>So we don’t start with zero the way we always have. Now we start with one. We visit one. It’s unmarked.</p>
<p>105<br>00:13:41,079 –&gt; 00:13:47,319<br>And now all the vertices that we visit during that DFS are going to be in the same strong component.</p>
<p>106<br>00:13:47,319 –&gt; 00:13:53,399<br>That’s the theorem that makes this algorithm work. In this case, there’s the only the only the one. So</p>
<p>107<br>00:13:56,439 –&gt; 00:14:01,399<br>vertex one is the only is it’s in its own strong component with label zero.</p>
<p>108<br>00:14:02,279 –&gt; 00:14:08,120<br>So now we’ve got to start one’s all done. So now we have to start with looking for another vertex to</p>
<p>109<br>00:14:08,120 –&gt; 00:14:14,439<br>search from. In this case, it’s zero is second on the list. So that’s where we start with zero.</p>
<p>110<br>00:14:15,079 –&gt; 00:14:20,839<br>And now all the vertices that we can reach from zero are going to have a strong in this graph are</p>
<p>111<br>00:14:20,840 –&gt; 00:14:27,480<br>going to have strong component label one. So we do the DFS. So first we get to five. That’s in the same</p>
<p>112<br>00:14:27,480 –&gt; 00:14:35,879<br>strong component. We check four and it’s unmarked. So we label it. We check three. It’s unmarked. We check</p>
<p>113<br>00:14:36,440 –&gt; 00:14:45,639<br>five, which is marked. We check two, which is unmarked. So now we have shown that zero, two, three,</p>
<p>114<br>00:14:45,639 –&gt; 00:14:53,319<br>four and five are all in the same strong component. And now we’re going to find both vertices we</p>
<p>115<br>00:14:53,319 –&gt; 00:15:00,759<br>get to from two or mark. So we’re done with two. Then we’re done with three. Four, we have to check</p>
<p>116<br>00:15:00,759 –&gt; 00:15:08,120<br>two, which is marked. And then we’re done with four and five. From zero, we can check one, but</p>
<p>117<br>00:15:08,120 –&gt; 00:15:15,399<br>that’s already marked. So that’s not relevant for this search. And then we’re done with zero. And we</p>
<p>118<br>00:15:15,399 –&gt; 00:15:20,199<br>have established that zero, two, three, four and five are all in the same strong component.</p>
<p>119<br>00:15:21,480 –&gt; 00:15:28,120<br>So that’s the second one. So now we continue and we check all of those in their all marked.</p>
<p>120<br>00:15:29,240 –&gt; 00:15:36,439<br>So the next vertex in the reverse post sort of reverse graph is 11. So we visit 11.</p>
<p>121<br>00:15:37,159 –&gt; 00:15:43,240<br>Check four. It’s already marked. Check 12. It’s not so we mark it. And these are the third</p>
<p>122<br>00:15:43,240 –&gt; 00:15:50,360<br>strong component. They get labeled with two. Then we get to nine. From nine, we check 11.</p>
<p>123<br>00:15:51,480 –&gt; 00:15:57,960<br>And nowhere to go. Then we check 10. And so that’s in the strong component. From 10, we check 12,</p>
<p>124<br>00:15:57,960 –&gt; 00:16:03,639<br>which is marked. We’re done with 10. We’re done with nine. We’re done with 12. And we’re done with</p>
<p>125<br>00:16:03,639 –&gt; 00:16:11,159<br>11. So that’s our third strong component, 9, 10, 11 and 12.</p>
<p>126<br>00:16:11,719 –&gt; 00:16:19,159<br>So we’re done with those. And now we go through the list to find another unmarked vertex.</p>
<p>127<br>00:16:19,159 –&gt; 00:16:26,519<br>9’s marked, 12’s marked, 10’s marked. We get to six from six. Nine’s already marked.</p>
<p>128<br>00:16:27,799 –&gt; 00:16:35,720<br>Four’s already marked. Eight’s not marked. So we go there. From eight, we can get to six. And that’s it.</p>
<p>129<br>00:16:35,720 –&gt; 00:16:43,160<br>Zero’s already marked. So we can only get to eight from six at this point. And so that’s a strong</p>
<p>130<br>00:16:43,160 –&gt; 00:16:50,360<br>component. And then finally, we finish up by doing seven. So the end of the computation</p>
<p>131<br>00:16:51,000 –&gt; 00:16:58,120<br>gives us the strong component array, which is a unique ID for each of the vertices. So that two</p>
<p>132<br>00:16:58,120 –&gt; 00:17:05,160<br>vertices in the same strong component have the same ID. And that’s a sports constant time,</p>
<p>133<br>00:17:05,640 –&gt; 00:17:13,320<br>strong connectivity checks for clients. So the bottom line is that this algorithm is a very simple,</p>
<p>134<br>00:17:14,120 –&gt; 00:17:21,240<br>even though it might be mysterious, algorithm for computing the strong component. First, run DFS</p>
<p>135<br>00:17:21,240 –&gt; 00:17:27,720<br>on the reverse graph to compute the reverse post-order. Then run DFS on the original graph,</p>
<p>136<br>00:17:27,720 –&gt; 00:17:37,319<br>considering the vertices in the order given by the first DFS. And so these diagrams give a</p>
<p>137<br>00:17:37,319 –&gt; 00:17:45,240<br>summary of the computation. I’m not going to spend too much time explaining why and how it works</p>
<p>138<br>00:17:45,240 –&gt; 00:17:53,319<br>in this lecture. But these kinds of diagrams give the detail that can give some intuition</p>
<p>139<br>00:17:54,119 –&gt; 00:18:04,279<br>about how and why the algorithm works. The proof is required some mathematical sophistication</p>
<p>140<br>00:18:04,279 –&gt; 00:18:11,799<br>and you’ll find it in the book. But the programming of it is quite simple and prove that it’s</p>
<p>141<br>00:18:12,279 –&gt; 00:18:20,519<br>efficient. All it does is run DFS twice. But to really see the correctness proof, you want to</p>
<p>142<br>00:18:20,519 –&gt; 00:18:26,839<br>look at the second printing of the textbook. We got it wrong in the first printing. But look</p>
<p>143<br>00:18:26,839 –&gt; 00:18:32,920<br>at the implementation. So this is connected components in an undirected graph with DFS that we did</p>
<p>144<br>00:18:32,920 –&gt; 00:18:38,920<br>last time. And I’m sure many of you thought it was one of the simplest algorithms that we looked at.</p>
<p>145<br>00:18:39,720 –&gt; 00:18:45,960<br>We just marked the vertices and do recursive DFS and that’s the end of it. If you take that code</p>
<p>146<br>00:18:46,840 –&gt; 00:18:57,960<br>and just add, well, change the names. And then just instead of going for the vertices from zero</p>
<p>147<br>00:18:57,960 –&gt; 00:19:05,960<br>through V minus one, if you first compute the depth first order that you get by running</p>
<p>148<br>00:19:08,360 –&gt; 00:19:14,200<br>doing a depth first search of the reverse graph and then you iterate through the vertices in that</p>
<p>149<br>00:19:14,200 –&gt; 00:19:20,279<br>order, you get an algorithm for strong connectivity. It’s really remarkable that just changing that one</p>
<p>150<br>00:19:20,279 –&gt; 00:19:31,080<br>line will perform this computation that was thought to be difficult for many years and people were</p>
<p>151<br>00:19:31,080 –&gt; 00:19:40,360<br>learning quite difficult codes for many, many years. So that’s a quick summary of die graph processing.</p>
<p>152<br>00:19:40,359 –&gt; 00:19:47,719<br>We talked about single source reachability, getting the paths from a vertex to any vertex that</p>
<p>153<br>00:19:47,719 –&gt; 00:19:54,199<br>can be reached from that vertex with a directed path. We talked about topological sort in graphs that</p>
<p>154<br>00:19:54,199 –&gt; 00:20:02,519<br>have no cycles and that uses DFS. And we talked about computing strong components in a die graph with</p>
<p>155<br>00:20:02,519 –&gt; 00:20:12,759<br>two DFSs. Die graph processing is really a testimony to the ingenuity that’s possible in algorithmic</p>
<p>156<br>00:20:12,759 –&gt; 00:20:14,599<br>graph processing.</p>
