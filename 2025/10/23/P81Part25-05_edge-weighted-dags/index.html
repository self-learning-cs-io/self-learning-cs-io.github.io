                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,640<br>Now we’re going to look at shortest paths in edge weighted digs.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,640 –&gt; 00:00:15,919<br>This is a very common situation and we’ll see a couple of important applications.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,919 –&gt; 00:00:22,440<br>Suppose that you’ve got an edge weighted digraph that’s our input to shortest paths but</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:22,440 –&gt; 00:00:28,039<br>there you know there’s no directed cycle and actually that’s true in many applications</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:28,039 –&gt; 00:00:29,400<br>that we’ll see some.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,399 –&gt; 00:00:34,839<br>The question is does the fact that it has no directed cycles make it easier to find</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:34,839 –&gt; 00:00:38,640<br>shortest paths than in a general digraph?</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:38,640 –&gt; 00:00:42,200<br>In the answer is yes, it certainly does.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:42,200 –&gt; 00:00:44,799<br>So let’s take a look at what happens.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:44,799 –&gt; 00:00:47,959<br>And the algorithm is very simple.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:47,959 –&gt; 00:00:53,439<br>What we’re going to do is just consider the vertices in topological order.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:53,439 –&gt; 00:00:59,200<br>Since there’s no cycles we know there’s a topological ordering where…</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:59,200 –&gt; 00:01:05,359<br>we can lay out the graph and all the edges point to vertices that we haven’t seen yet.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:05,359 –&gt; 00:01:10,040<br>And so we’re just relax all edges pointing from each vertex taking them in topological</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:10,040 –&gt; 00:01:11,040<br>order.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:11,040 –&gt; 00:01:15,599<br>Again this will be easy to see in an example.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:15,599 –&gt; 00:01:22,079<br>All right so here’s an edge weighted directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:22,079 –&gt; 00:01:28,200<br>The first thing that we do is sort of the vertices in topological order.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,200 –&gt; 00:01:34,520<br>And we talked about an algorithm for doing that a couple of lectures ago.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:34,520 –&gt; 00:01:37,439<br>So just using depth for search.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:37,439 –&gt; 00:01:43,400<br>So we consider vertex 0 and relax all the edges coming from vertex 0.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:43,400 –&gt; 00:01:53,159<br>And that gives us shortest paths to 1, 4 and 7.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:53,159 –&gt; 00:01:57,480<br>So next we consider vertex 1.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:57,480 –&gt; 00:02:03,000<br>We don’t do anything except take the next vertex in topological order.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:03,000 –&gt; 00:02:06,680<br>We could have also taken 4 in this case.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:06,680 –&gt; 00:02:12,960<br>And so we’re going to add that and then just relax along all the edges coming from that</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:12,960 –&gt; 00:02:14,800<br>vertex.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:14,800 –&gt; 00:02:22,360<br>In this case that gives us a new shortest path to 2 and to 3.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:22,360 –&gt; 00:02:24,240<br>Next is 4.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:24,240 –&gt; 00:02:30,280<br>And that gives us new shortest paths to 5 and 6.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:30,280 –&gt; 00:02:33,320<br>Next in topological order is 7.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:33,320 –&gt; 00:02:34,320<br>Relax.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:34,320 –&gt; 00:02:39,719<br>And that gives us the new shortest path to 2 but not to 5.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:39,719 –&gt; 00:02:44,080<br>The path that we already had to 5 is better.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:44,080 –&gt; 00:02:47,000<br>So next to the order is 5.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:47,000 –&gt; 00:02:48,000<br>Relax along edges.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:48,000 –&gt; 00:02:53,640<br>And it gives us better ways to get to both 2 and to 6.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:53,639 –&gt; 00:02:58,279<br>And then we do 3 and relax.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:58,279 –&gt; 00:02:59,479<br>And that’s as a help.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:59,479 –&gt; 00:03:02,479<br>And then we do 6.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:02,479 –&gt; 00:03:08,000<br>And when we’re done, all we did was consider the edges in topological order and relax.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:08,000 –&gt; 00:03:21,119<br>Then we have a shortest path to 3 from the source to every vertex in the directed a-cyclic</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:21,120 –&gt; 00:03:25,680<br>weighted diagram.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:25,680 –&gt; 00:03:29,520<br>So that’s a demo of a simple algorithm for that case.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:29,520 –&gt; 00:03:30,520<br>All right.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:30,520 –&gt; 00:03:37,400<br>Why does that algorithm considering the vertices in topological order work for iterated</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:37,400 –&gt; 00:03:39,200<br>digs?</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:39,200 –&gt; 00:03:44,759<br>Now one thing that’s pretty important about this is that the edge of weights could even</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:44,759 –&gt; 00:03:48,680<br>be negative, doesn’t matter to this algorithm.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:48,680 –&gt; 00:03:51,200<br>So let’s look again.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:51,200 –&gt; 00:03:55,560<br>Every edge is relaxed exactly one.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:55,560 –&gt; 00:04:04,040<br>When we add a vertex to the tree, we relax each of the edges that go from that vertex.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:04,040 –&gt; 00:04:10,439<br>And again, just as with Dykstra, after we’re done with the relaxation, we have this condition</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:10,439 –&gt; 00:04:16,720<br>hold that distance w is less than or equal distance to v plus the edge weight.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:16,720 –&gt; 00:04:21,920<br>Either it was beforehand and we ignored the weight or we made it equal.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:21,920 –&gt; 00:04:30,040<br>And so when we relax an edge, we have that condition.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:30,040 –&gt; 00:04:35,520<br>And again, the inequality holds until the algorithm terminates.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:35,520 –&gt; 00:04:43,600<br>Well first, again, we only decrease values in the distru array.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:43,600 –&gt; 00:04:44,600<br>We don’t change at the increase.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:44,600 –&gt; 00:04:49,960<br>So the only thing that can happen to distru w is that it gets smaller and that’s not going</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:49,960 –&gt; 00:04:52,920<br>to violate the inequality.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:52,920 –&gt; 00:04:58,920<br>And then the other thing is distru v is not going to change because of the topological</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:58,920 –&gt; 00:05:00,240<br>order.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:00,240 –&gt; 00:05:04,260<br>When we process v’s in topological order, that means we’re not going to find an edge that</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:04,260 –&gt; 00:05:05,920<br>points to v.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:05,920 –&gt; 00:05:10,240<br>So distru v is not going to change and the edge weight doesn’t change.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:10,240 –&gt; 00:05:12,160<br>So the inequality holds.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:12,160 –&gt; 00:05:16,800<br>This is true even if the edge weights are negative.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:16,800 –&gt; 00:05:20,439<br>So shortest path up the malady conditions hold.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:20,439 –&gt; 00:05:28,080<br>And so this simple algorithm finds shortest path in the edge weighted directed acycocraft,</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:28,080 –&gt; 00:05:35,960<br>whether or not the edge weights are positive or negative.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:35,960 –&gt; 00:05:38,680<br>Pretty easy algorithm to implement.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:38,680 –&gt; 00:05:42,840<br>So this is acyclic shortest path.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:42,840 –&gt; 00:05:46,280<br>So the goal is to compute edge 2 and distru.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:46,280 –&gt; 00:05:50,360<br>And then we use those to respond to client queries of the length of the shortest path in</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:50,360 –&gt; 00:05:52,960<br>the path itself.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:52,960 –&gt; 00:05:54,920<br>This is the constructor.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:54,920 –&gt; 00:05:56,600<br>We build the array.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:56,600 –&gt; 00:06:02,319<br>We initialize his distances to infinity, distance to source to zero.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:02,319 –&gt; 00:06:11,319<br>And then we use our topological sort algorithm on digraph to compute an interval that gives</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:11,319 –&gt; 00:06:15,040<br>us the vertices in topological order.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:15,040 –&gt; 00:06:19,079<br>And that’s the order method in this topological class.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:19,079 –&gt; 00:06:27,240<br>That’s using the API that we set up for topological sorting, which has to be adapted to weighted</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:27,240 –&gt; 00:06:28,240<br>digraphs.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:28,240 –&gt; 00:06:34,240<br>But that’s just adding some moment clature.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:34,240 –&gt; 00:06:37,759<br>So we take the vertices in topological order.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:37,759 –&gt; 00:06:43,439<br>We take for every vertex in topological order, take in topological order, we take every</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:43,439 –&gt; 00:06:46,680<br>edge that emanates from that vertex and relax it.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:46,680 –&gt; 00:06:49,040<br>That couldn’t be simpler.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:49,040 –&gt; 00:06:50,040<br>And then we’re done.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:50,040 –&gt; 00:06:56,840<br>We have the shortest path in that work, even for negative edge weights.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:56,840 –&gt; 00:06:58,560<br>Pretty simple.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:58,560 –&gt; 00:07:08,320<br>Now as an example of a familiar application of shortest paths in digs and weighted digs,</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:08,320 –&gt; 00:07:12,520<br>we’ll look at the idea of seam carving.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:12,520 –&gt; 00:07:18,560<br>This is a relatively recent algorithm that was developed that has an important application</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:18,560 –&gt; 00:07:23,120<br>that you’ll see in this YouTube film clip.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:23,120 –&gt; 00:07:27,639<br>Seem carving for content aware image resizing.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:27,639 –&gt; 00:07:31,560<br>Digital media today has the ability to support dynamic page layouts.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:31,560 –&gt; 00:07:35,680<br>By changing the window or display size, we can change the layout of a document.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:35,680 –&gt; 00:07:40,759<br>However, images embedded in a document typically remain rigid in size and shape.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:40,759 –&gt; 00:07:44,800<br>Resizing is also important to fit images into different displays.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:44,800 –&gt; 00:07:48,480<br>Some techniques, including cropping or scaling, are limited in their abilities to capture</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:48,480 –&gt; 00:07:51,560<br>the image content.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:51,560 –&gt; 00:07:54,920<br>We present a method for content aware resizing of images.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:54,920 –&gt; 00:07:59,120<br>Our technique enables resizing while adapting the image content and layout.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:59,120 –&gt; 00:08:06,560<br>This is sometimes called retargeting.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:06,560 –&gt; 00:08:12,960<br>We also define a flexible multi-size representation for images that supports continuous resizing.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:13,959 –&gt; 00:08:18,479<br>An image can be shrunken and non-uniform in a manner while preserving its features,</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:18,479 –&gt; 00:08:24,319<br>but it can also be extended beyond its original size.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:24,319 –&gt; 00:08:28,399<br>Instead of scrolling through images that do not fit in a given display, we gracefully</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:28,399 –&gt; 00:08:34,480<br>resize them to fit inside the window.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:34,480 –&gt; 00:08:37,720<br>For example, assume that we need to change the width of an image.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:37,720 –&gt; 00:08:41,879<br>The simplest way to do this is to remove columns of pixels from the image.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:41,879 –&gt; 00:08:46,679<br>The best column to remove would be the least noticeable or least important column.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:46,679 –&gt; 00:08:50,799<br>We can search for this column by defining an important Sir Energy function on the image.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:50,799 –&gt; 00:08:54,879<br>In this example, we use the gradient magnitude of the image.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:54,879 –&gt; 00:08:58,360<br>Next we look for the column which contains the least energy and remove it.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:58,360 –&gt; 00:09:02,039<br>However, using such an approach quickly leads to serious artifacts.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:02,039 –&gt; 00:09:06,240<br>Therefore, instead of using rigid columns, we search for connected paths of pixels or</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:06,240 –&gt; 00:09:11,679<br>seams from one side of the image to the other that contain the least energy.</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:11,679 –&gt; 00:09:15,519<br>This can be done using a simple dynamic programming algorithm that is described in the paper</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:15,519 –&gt; 00:09:19,159<br>in both vertical and horizontal directions.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:19,159 –&gt; 00:09:23,599<br>Here is another example of an image, its energy function, and the least noticeable horizontal</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:23,599 –&gt; 00:09:27,279<br>and vertical seams.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:27,279 –&gt; 00:09:32,279<br>By successfully removing horizontal and vertical seams, the image can be resized in a non-uniform</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:32,279 –&gt; 00:09:33,919<br>manner.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:33,919 –&gt; 00:09:38,120<br>The order of seam removal in an image defines an order on the pixels of the image.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:38,120 –&gt; 00:09:44,960<br>By storing the simple indexing information, we create content to wear multi-size images.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:44,960 –&gt; 00:09:53,240<br>So that’s an amazingly powerful image processing process.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:53,240 –&gt; 00:10:01,000<br>You’ll find it all over image processing applications from Photoshop to GIMP to Image Magic.</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:01,000 –&gt; 00:10:08,919<br>And actually nowadays, almost any image that you see on your cell phone or your tablet.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:08,919 –&gt; 00:10:12,480<br>What really does that have to do with shortest paths?</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:12,480 –&gt; 00:10:21,919<br>Well, it’s actually a direct application of shortest paths on a directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:21,919 –&gt; 00:10:25,600<br>So what we do is build a huge directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:25,600 –&gt; 00:10:32,800<br>This is a really huge graph because images now at high resolution can have millions or</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:32,800 –&gt; 00:10:35,600<br>billions of pixels.</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:35,600 –&gt; 00:10:41,000<br>And so every pixel corresponds to a vertex in this graph.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:41,000 –&gt; 00:10:47,639<br>And the edges are going to be just directed edges from every pixel to its three downward</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:47,639 –&gt; 00:10:50,440<br>neighbors.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:50,440 –&gt; 00:10:53,639<br>And then there’s what weight do we assign to the pixels?</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:53,639 –&gt; 00:10:58,679<br>Well, there’s an energy function that has to do with the image processing.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:58,679 –&gt; 00:11:03,759<br>That is a function of the eight neighboring pixels.</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:03,759 –&gt; 00:11:08,199<br>Every pixel has a relationship with all its neighboring pixels.</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:08,199 –&gt; 00:11:19,439<br>And the energy function is an image processing concept that is perfect for assigning weights</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:19,439 –&gt; 00:11:22,080<br>in this instance.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:22,080 –&gt; 00:11:24,840<br>And so that is the weights.</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:24,840 –&gt; 00:11:31,320<br>And then a seam is just the shortest path that goes from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:31,320 –&gt; 00:11:39,600<br>So you can imagine the imaginary source that goes all to the top ones and just run the shortest</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:39,600 –&gt; 00:11:42,560<br>path algorithm that we just gave.</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:42,560 –&gt; 00:11:45,960<br>And it’ll find a seam.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:45,960 –&gt; 00:11:51,639<br>So that’s the lowest energy one pixel cut through the image.</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:51,639 –&gt; 00:12:00,519<br>And then the resizing algorithm just deletes one pixel on each row along that seam and that’s</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:00,519 –&gt; 00:12:01,519<br>the algorithm.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:01,519 –&gt; 00:12:12,120<br>So the shortest path algorithm that allows and enables the resizing for a really huge graph.</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:12,120 –&gt; 00:12:18,080<br>And it’s really important to realize that you have to have an efficient implementation</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:18,080 –&gt; 00:12:22,320<br>of the shortest path algorithm because there’s so many pixels.</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:22,320 –&gt; 00:12:27,120<br>And certainly the topological sort algorithm that we gave is extremely efficient linear</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:27,120 –&gt; 00:12:28,679<br>time algorithm.</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:28,679 –&gt; 00:12:33,879<br>And you can see the effects of that efficient algorithm all around you.</p>
<p>160<br>00:12:33,879 –&gt; 00:12:41,919<br>Here’s another completely different application of shortest paths in directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>161<br>00:12:41,919 –&gt; 00:12:51,439<br>And the idea is that actually since negative weights are allowed, we can find longest path</p>
<p>162<br>00:12:51,439 –&gt; 00:12:57,639<br>in educated dags just by negating all the weights.</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:57,639 –&gt; 00:13:06,319<br>So what I want is I have an educated dag.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:06,319 –&gt; 00:13:10,319<br>And what I want is this is with I guess five of the source.</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:10,320 –&gt; 00:13:13,120<br>I don’t want the shortest path from five to two.</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:13,120 –&gt; 00:13:16,160<br>I want the longest path from five to two.</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:16,160 –&gt; 00:13:20,120<br>I will see an application why that’s important in a minute.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:20,120 –&gt; 00:13:26,680<br>In order to get that, all I do is just negate all the weights and then run shortest path.</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:26,680 –&gt; 00:13:33,200<br>And if you add up negative weights to get the smallest negative number, then negate the</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:33,200 –&gt; 00:13:34,200<br>answer.</p>
<p>171<br>00:13:34,200 –&gt; 00:13:36,920<br>That’s the longest path.</p>
<p>172<br>00:13:36,919 –&gt; 00:13:43,039<br>And it works because the algorithm topological sort algorithm doesn’t care whether the weights</p>
<p>173<br>00:13:43,039 –&gt; 00:13:45,039<br>are positive or negative.</p>
<p>174<br>00:13:45,039 –&gt; 00:13:50,120<br>In general graphs, it does matter as we’ll see in a minute, but for acyclic graph doesn’t</p>
<p>175<br>00:13:50,120 –&gt; 00:13:51,120<br>matter.</p>
<p>176<br>00:13:51,120 –&gt; 00:13:56,240<br>We can find longest paths in acyclic graphs just by negating all the weights.</p>
<p>177<br>00:13:56,240 –&gt; 00:14:00,599<br>Therefore we can solve the longest paths problem.</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:00,599 –&gt; 00:14:02,199<br>So that’s a key point.</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:02,199 –&gt; 00:14:05,839<br>And now we can look at applications of that problem.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:05,840 –&gt; 00:14:11,200<br>And there’s a really important application for longest path in aged weighted, directed</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:11,200 –&gt; 00:14:12,960<br>acyclic graphs.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:12,960 –&gt; 00:14:16,120<br>And that’s called the job scheduling problem.</p>
<p>183<br>00:14:16,120 –&gt; 00:14:21,560<br>And this is just another example to show the importance of the shortest paths problem as</p>
<p>184<br>00:14:21,560 –&gt; 00:14:24,280<br>a problem solving model.</p>
<p>185<br>00:14:24,280 –&gt; 00:14:28,440<br>This particular problem doesn’t seem related to shortest paths at all, but we’ll show how</p>
<p>186<br>00:14:28,440 –&gt; 00:14:31,320<br>to formulate it as a shortest path problem.</p>
<p>187<br>00:14:31,320 –&gt; 00:14:34,879<br>And that’s great because we have an efficient solution to the shortest path problem.</p>
<p>188<br>00:14:34,879 –&gt; 00:14:38,600<br>Or actually it’s the longest path problem in this case.</p>
<p>189<br>00:14:38,600 –&gt; 00:14:45,960<br>So this is just an example that arises in manufacturing or other applications.</p>
<p>190<br>00:14:45,960 –&gt; 00:14:49,279<br>We have a complex set of interacting processes.</p>
<p>191<br>00:14:49,279 –&gt; 00:14:52,960<br>So this is called job scheduling, parallel job scheduling.</p>
<p>192<br>00:14:52,960 –&gt; 00:14:58,559<br>So I’ve got a bunch of, as I say, a factory manager has a bunch of jobs to manage and</p>
<p>193<br>00:14:58,559 –&gt; 00:15:03,240<br>they have durations and precedence constraints.</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:03,240 –&gt; 00:15:07,440<br>So durations just means the job takes a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>195<br>00:15:07,440 –&gt; 00:15:14,720<br>And precedence constraints means that you can’t start job one until after job zero is done.</p>
<p>196<br>00:15:14,720 –&gt; 00:15:21,879<br>Or seven or nine, one seven and nine, have to start sometime after job zero.</p>
<p>197<br>00:15:21,879 –&gt; 00:15:27,320<br>And similarly three and eight have to start after six and so forth.</p>
<p>198<br>00:15:27,320 –&gt; 00:15:29,759<br>So maybe this is manufacturing a car.</p>
<p>199<br>00:15:30,600 –&gt; 00:15:36,480<br>You can paint the car until after you put the doors on or whatever else you can imagine.</p>
<p>200<br>00:15:36,480 –&gt; 00:15:46,799<br>Easily setting up precedence constraints that are natural for trying to complete this whole set of job.</p>
<p>201<br>00:15:46,799 –&gt; 00:15:56,279<br>And so what we want to do is find a start time for each job that minimizes the completion time.</p>
<p>202<br>00:15:56,279 –&gt; 00:16:00,799<br>While still respecting all the precedence constraints.</p>
<p>203<br>00:16:00,799 –&gt; 00:16:02,559<br>So when do we start each job?</p>
<p>204<br>00:16:02,559 –&gt; 00:16:05,240<br>That’s the parallel job scheduling problem.</p>
<p>205<br>00:16:05,240 –&gt; 00:16:10,079<br>We assume that we’ve got enough workers that we can have a bunch of jobs going on at the same time.</p>
<p>206<br>00:16:10,079 –&gt; 00:16:11,879<br>Same time.</p>
<p>207<br>00:16:11,879 –&gt; 00:16:25,079<br>So this graph model shows that we can change the job scheduling problem into a graph processing problem.</p>
<p>208<br>00:16:25,080 –&gt; 00:16:31,680<br>So what we’re going to do is create an edge weighted directed a cyclic graph the following way.</p>
<p>209<br>00:16:31,680 –&gt; 00:16:41,680<br>We’re going to have a source and sink vertex that the source is begin everything and the sink is end everything.</p>
<p>210<br>00:16:41,680 –&gt; 00:16:47,960<br>And then we’ll have a zero weight edge from the for every job.</p>
<p>211<br>00:16:47,960 –&gt; 00:16:51,200<br>We’ll have a start and a finish vertex for that job.</p>
<p>212<br>00:16:51,200 –&gt; 00:16:55,759<br>And then we’ll have an edge whose weight is the duration.</p>
<p>213<br>00:16:55,759 –&gt; 00:17:06,360<br>And from the finish vertex of every job, we’ll have edges to the start vertex of the jobs that it has to complete before that those are the precedence constraints.</p>
<p>214<br>00:17:06,360 –&gt; 00:17:19,680<br>We have a zero weight edge from the overall source to every job start and a zero weight edge from the overall from every job finish to the sink vertex.</p>
<p>215<br>00:17:19,680 –&gt; 00:17:24,880<br>And so in summary, there’s three edges for every job.</p>
<p>216<br>00:17:24,880 –&gt; 00:17:34,279<br>This is from the beginning to the end, the start to the finish, weighted by the duration from the source to the beginning zero weight and from the end of the sink zero weight.</p>
<p>217<br>00:17:34,279 –&gt; 00:17:39,720<br>And the edges for the precedence constraints also have zero weight.</p>
<p>218<br>00:17:39,720 –&gt; 00:17:41,840<br>So that’s a graph model.</p>
<p>219<br>00:17:41,839 –&gt; 00:17:45,759<br>We took our scheduling problem and now we have a graph.</p>
<p>220<br>00:17:45,759 –&gt; 00:17:58,879<br>And what relates this to what we’ve been talking about is the longest path from the source to each job turns out to give a schedule.</p>
<p>221<br>00:17:58,879 –&gt; 00:18:09,319<br>So the job scheduling problem corresponds to a solution to the longest path problem in directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>222<br>00:18:09,319 –&gt; 00:18:16,679<br>By the way, this graph doesn’t have any cycles because that would mean you’d have to do a job before another job.</p>
<p>223<br>00:18:16,679 –&gt; 00:18:21,799<br>It insists that one be done after zero and the two be done after one.</p>
<p>224<br>00:18:21,799 –&gt; 00:18:31,599<br>You can’t also insist that zero be done after two because that would be a precedence cycle that couldn’t be satisfied at all.</p>
<p>225<br>00:18:31,599 –&gt; 00:18:42,799<br>And so now you have to think about this quite a while to understand why the longest path from the source will schedule each job.</p>
<p>226<br>00:18:42,799 –&gt; 00:18:50,439<br>But that’s a fact in that it means then we have a fast linear time algorithm for solving this problem.</p>
<p>227<br>00:18:50,439 –&gt; 00:18:57,839<br>On the gate all the weights run shortest paths with topological sort and the gate the answer and you have the start time for every job.</p>
<p>228<br>00:18:57,839 –&gt; 00:19:08,480<br>In fact, in the book in the book site you’ll find code that solves this schedule and parallel job scheduling problem using the critical path method.</p>
<p>229<br>00:19:08,480 –&gt; 00:19:15,679<br>Again, showing how important it is to have a fast and efficient solution to the shortest paths problem.</p>
