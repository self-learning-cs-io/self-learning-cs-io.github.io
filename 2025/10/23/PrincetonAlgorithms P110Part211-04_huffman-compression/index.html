                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:10,320<br>Next we’ll look at huffman encoding. This is a classic algorithm that is still widely used</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:10,320 –&gt; 00:00:16,179<br>and effectively used today. It’s definitely on the list of algorithms that everyone should</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,179 –&gt; 00:00:24,280<br>know because it’s quite ingenious. So we start out with the idea of variable length codes.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:24,280 –&gt; 00:00:28,519<br>So far we’ve talked about codes where every character is represented with the same number</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:28,519 –&gt; 00:00:35,840<br>of bits but there’s no reason to do that. For example look at Morse code. The idea in a way</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:35,840 –&gt; 00:00:42,359<br>that we assign dots and dashes to letters is that frequently used letters should have a smaller</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:42,359 –&gt; 00:00:50,159<br>number of characters. So for example an E is only one dot and so forth and letters that are</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:50,159 –&gt; 00:00:58,320<br>used less frequently like you are going to be longer, more dashes and more characters.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:58,320 –&gt; 00:01:09,960<br>So with this we can, it’s an idea, compression idea of let’s use fewer characters for fewer bits</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:09,960 –&gt; 00:01:17,159<br>or fewer code characters for frequently used characters. Now there’s an issue with this and that</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:17,159 –&gt; 00:01:25,200<br>is that it can be ambiguous. So this message everybody knows looks like SOS 3 dots followed</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:25,200 –&gt; 00:01:36,760<br>by 3 dashes followed by 3 dots but actually it could be any one of these others like v is dot dot</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:36,760 –&gt; 00:01:46,240<br>dot dash. So that’s good. And then 7 is dash dash dot dot dot so it could be v7 or it could be either</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:46,240 –&gt; 00:01:51,719<br>of these two. There’s lots of different things that this thing could be. So Morse code is actually</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:51,719 –&gt; 00:02:00,599<br>it’s not just dots and dashes. It actually has a little space between the code words to avoid this</p>
<p>16<br>00:02:00,599 –&gt; 00:02:10,759<br>problem that there’s ambiguity caused by the fact that one code word can be prefix of another and</p>
<p>17<br>00:02:10,759 –&gt; 00:02:19,960<br>there’s no way to tell it is not without separating the code words. So now that’s the way it’s solved in Morse code</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:19,960 –&gt; 00:02:26,680<br>and that’s not necessarily the most efficient way to solve it and that’s what huffman code addresses. Also a</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:26,680 –&gt; 00:02:32,800<br>problem with Morse code is don’t be trying to transmit a lot of numbers with Morse code because the codes</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:32,800 –&gt; 00:02:44,000<br>for those are pretty long and you’ll have much longer representations for codes that involve message</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:44,000 –&gt; 00:02:50,719<br>about a lot of numbers. But there’s a really elegant way to avoid ambiguity and that is to just</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:50,719 –&gt; 00:02:57,280<br>adopt the rule that no code word is going to be a prefix of another one. So fixed length codes do</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:57,280 –&gt; 00:03:03,439<br>that. If every code is the same number of bits and every character code different bits then no</p>
<p>24<br>00:03:03,439 –&gt; 00:03:09,759<br>code words are prefix of another they’re just all different. Another thing you can do is have a special</p>
<p>25<br>00:03:09,759 –&gt; 00:03:17,199<br>stop character like the space in Morse code to end to each code word that’s really what it’s doing. So the</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:17,199 –&gt; 00:03:23,679<br>code words are all different and they end with a character that’s special and so none can be a prefix of</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:23,679 –&gt; 00:03:32,719<br>another one. But there’s also just an easy way to just make sure that you use a code that has this</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:32,719 –&gt; 00:03:42,319<br>prefix free property. So for example this code here no code word is a prefix of another and it means when</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:42,319 –&gt; 00:03:50,960<br>you have bits this is a unique way to decode. So here the compressed bit string starts with zero the</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:50,960 –&gt; 00:03:56,800<br>only way that can happen is just the first letter is a. Then when you’re done with the a you’ve got four</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:56,800 –&gt; 00:04:04,800<br>one and that leads it’s got to be a B and then you get rid of the B and so forth and it’s three ones</p>
<p>32<br>00:04:04,800 –&gt; 00:04:12,960<br>and zero it’s got to be an R and so forth. Since no code words are prefix of another you can just read off</p>
<p>33<br>00:04:12,960 –&gt; 00:04:22,160<br>the code from the bit string without having any special stop character any efficiency clause by that.</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:23,120 –&gt; 00:04:28,480<br>All we have is the bits and we’re able to uniquely decode it and there’s a numerous prefix free</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:28,480 –&gt; 00:04:36,880<br>codes for example here’s another prefix free code that for the same five characters and it actually</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:36,880 –&gt; 00:04:46,080<br>uses fewer bits. So the idea of Huffman and coding within these rules where we must have a prefix</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:46,560 –&gt; 00:04:53,359<br>free code and we’ve got a particular message what’s amazing about Huffman and coding is that it</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:53,359 –&gt; 00:05:00,639<br>finds the code that uses the fewest bits for that message and that’s why it’s so effective.</p>
<p>39<br>00:05:01,680 –&gt; 00:05:09,599<br>So the interesting thing or one interesting thing about prefix free codes is that they’re really</p>
<p>40<br>00:05:09,600 –&gt; 00:05:19,200<br>easy to represent with tries and the idea is very simple we put characters in the leaf and we</p>
<p>41<br>00:05:19,200 –&gt; 00:05:25,120<br>imagine that every this is binary tries so we imagine that there’s only two links for known</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:25,120 –&gt; 00:05:29,920<br>and we imagine that every left link is labeled zero and every right link is labeled one</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:31,280 –&gt; 00:05:39,280<br>and then just following the path from the root to a leaf so say we go right that’s 1 0 0</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:39,760 –&gt; 00:05:46,000<br>that’s D those bits are not stored in the try we just keep we just implicitly keep track of them</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:46,000 –&gt; 00:05:54,240<br>if we go left we keep 0 if we go right we keep 1 and so a try for prefix free code uniquely</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:55,040 –&gt; 00:06:04,080<br>determines the code and that means that just working with the try we can decompress a bit string</p>
<p>47<br>00:06:04,080 –&gt; 00:06:09,120<br>just by starting at the root reading the bits take them where they take us and when we get to a leaf</p>
<p>48<br>00:06:09,120 –&gt; 00:06:14,639<br>we’ve got a character so that’s the try corresponding to that code that’s the try corresponding to</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:14,639 –&gt; 00:06:20,800<br>that code this one starts out with 1 1 so starting at the root we go 1 1 in the first letters A</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:20,800 –&gt; 00:06:30,639<br>and then the next letters are 0 0 and so we go 0 0 we come to B and so forth a simple representation</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:30,639 –&gt; 00:06:38,800<br>of a prefix free code that is actually makes for easy decoding given the bit string in the</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:38,800 –&gt; 00:06:47,120<br>try it’s pretty easy to decode you could also keep a symbol table of pairs but</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:48,720 –&gt; 00:06:55,360<br>sorry for compression how do we do compression that was expansion so for compression we could just</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:55,360 –&gt; 00:07:03,199<br>keep a table and use it you could also use the try to figure out the code by following the path</p>
<p>55<br>00:07:03,199 –&gt; 00:07:11,279<br>up to the root and for expansion as I just said you started to the root go left to 0 right of 1</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:11,759 –&gt; 00:07:23,759<br>and it’s very easy so for expansion so we’ll look at the code for both of these and the question</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:23,759 –&gt; 00:07:30,639<br>is how to construct the first question is how to construct the try so let’s start with the data type</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:30,879 –&gt; 00:07:41,199<br>so this is similar to other tree structures that we’ve built before where we have a character</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:42,719 –&gt; 00:07:49,439<br>that we don’t use for internal or just for leaves we’ve got the frequency that we use while</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:49,439 –&gt; 00:07:56,159<br>we’re building the try but not when we’re expanding and then every node has a left and a right</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:57,120 –&gt; 00:08:04,640<br>and this is the constructor to just fill in all the fields we need a method to tell us if</p>
<p>62<br>00:08:05,360 –&gt; 00:08:12,879<br>current nodes are leaf and that’s when so that’s both its links are in all and we need a</p>
<p>63<br>00:08:12,879 –&gt; 00:08:19,440<br>compared to to compare nodes by frequency and we’ll see why that’s needed later on so that’s the</p>
<p>64<br>00:08:20,080 –&gt; 00:08:25,840<br>data type for the nodes that we’re going to use to build the tries and so now let’s look at</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:25,839 –&gt; 00:08:35,839<br>expansion so this is in code what I just talked about so we’re going to have a method that reads in</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:35,839 –&gt; 00:08:41,439<br>some of the bit string and converts it to a try now that’s one clever part of the algorithm</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:42,480 –&gt; 00:08:52,319<br>and then the first thing is the number of characters in the code in the message we also get that</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:52,320 –&gt; 00:09:00,080<br>so we get to try and then we get the number of characters and then we simply for do a for-loop</p>
<p>69<br>00:09:00,080 –&gt; 00:09:07,760<br>for the number of characters and start at the root if we’re not at a leaf we read a bit and if it’s</p>
<p>70<br>00:09:07,760 –&gt; 00:09:18,960<br>zero we go left and it’s one we go right and that’s it if as soon as we get to a leaf we just</p>
<p>71<br>00:09:18,960 –&gt; 00:09:24,400<br>write out the character that we get and then go back to the root and keep going we’re not in leaf</p>
<p>72<br>00:09:24,400 –&gt; 00:09:29,519<br>now if we read a bit with zero go they’ll have to one go to the right when we get to a leaf we write</p>
<p>73<br>00:09:29,519 –&gt; 00:09:37,120<br>out the character extremely compact code for expanding given a bit string first thing is the</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:37,120 –&gt; 00:09:42,720<br>try we have to talk about how to get the try in from a bit string number of characters and then this</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:42,720 –&gt; 00:09:50,800<br>simple loop that expands according to the try representation so that’s that works for any</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:50,800 –&gt; 00:09:59,440<br>prefix-free code not just the cuff and hoof and code in the running time is obviously linear</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:59,440 –&gt; 00:10:05,519<br>in the number of bits because for it’s just a loop that choose up a bit every time in the loop</p>
<p>78<br>00:10:06,000 –&gt; 00:10:17,199<br>okay so so again for any prefix-free code how are we going to actually write the try well</p>
<p>79<br>00:10:17,199 –&gt; 00:10:24,879<br>that it’s a little little clever but not by this time you should be ready for this kind of algorithm</p>
<p>80<br>00:10:25,039 –&gt; 00:10:39,200<br>what you can do is traverse the try in pre-order and when you come to an internal node you write a zero</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:40,000 –&gt; 00:10:45,279<br>when you come to a leaf you write a one followed by the 8-bit character at that leaf</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:46,000 –&gt; 00:10:58,000<br>so it’s a simple pre-order traversal if this is recursive program not to write out any try if</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:58,000 –&gt; 00:11:03,439<br>you’re out of leaf I write a one followed by the 8-bit characters at the leaf and you’re done</p>
<p>84<br>00:11:04,639 –&gt; 00:11:12,959<br>and if you’re not at a leaf you simply write a zero and then recursively do the two sub-tries</p>
<p>85<br>00:11:13,920 –&gt; 00:11:21,360<br>and that gives a unique representation of the try that can be used to construct a try from that</p>
<p>86<br>00:11:21,840 –&gt; 00:11:33,120<br>bit string so and ideas that typically we’re talking about a very long message that try itself</p>
<p>87<br>00:11:33,920 –&gt; 00:11:41,600<br>is just basically encodings of all the possible characters in a message that’s going to tend to be small</p>
<p>88<br>00:11:42,240 –&gt; 00:11:49,440<br>compared to the length of the message so for say a genomic sequence there will be only four characters</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:50,399 –&gt; 00:11:55,440<br>and the ones that use most frequently hopefully would be encoded with not that many bits</p>
<p>90<br>00:11:56,800 –&gt; 00:12:02,639<br>of course but anyway the size of the try itself is going to be much smaller than the length of the message</p>
<p>91<br>00:12:04,480 –&gt; 00:12:09,120<br>so reading in the try and there’s requires a little bit of thought but</p>
<p>92<br>00:12:09,759 –&gt; 00:12:14,560<br>and we see the code the code is extremely simple we just reconstructed from</p>
<p>93<br>00:12:15,679 –&gt; 00:12:21,360<br>the pre-order traversal of the try so this is the read try method that we needed that reads bits</p>
<p>94<br>00:12:21,360 –&gt; 00:12:30,960<br>from binary standard in and produces a try and it’s also recursive and if the bit that you read is</p>
<p>95<br>00:12:31,840 –&gt; 00:12:39,759<br>zero that sorry if the bit that you read is one that means you have to create a leaf</p>
<p>96<br>00:12:41,600 –&gt; 00:12:50,000<br>otherwise you recursively read the left and read the right and make a new note that</p>
<p>97<br>00:12:52,400 –&gt; 00:12:57,120<br>has a sub-tries that the two notes to the left and the right and it doesn’t</p>
<p>98<br>00:12:57,440 –&gt; 00:13:03,440<br>doesn’t use the character in the second one the frequency we initialize to zero</p>
<p>99<br>00:13:04,639 –&gt; 00:13:10,159<br>so internal nodes we don’t use the character so if you look at what would this</p>
<p>100<br>00:13:11,200 –&gt; 00:13:22,159<br>code do for this bit string so the first bit is zero so it’s going to recursively call itself to</p>
<p>101<br>00:13:22,240 –&gt; 00:13:31,199<br>read a try on the left and so the next bit is a one so it’s going to read the next eight bits to</p>
<p>102<br>00:13:31,199 –&gt; 00:13:40,000<br>get the A and it’s going to return a new node with that character and that’s a leaf so that’s</p>
<p>103<br>00:13:40,000 –&gt; 00:13:46,879<br>going to be the left sub-tree of the initial try the first recursive call and then it’ll read</p>
<p>104<br>00:13:46,960 –&gt; 00:13:52,000<br>the rights of tree which is an internal node another internal node it takes a little thinking</p>
<p>105<br>00:13:52,000 –&gt; 00:14:00,000<br>to convince yourself this works but it does and it’s very compact and easy code and it again</p>
<p>106<br>00:14:00,000 –&gt; 00:14:06,879<br>works for any prefix code you encode the try with prefix traversal and with a very small amount</p>
<p>107<br>00:14:06,879 –&gt; 00:14:13,600<br>of code you can reconstruct the try and transmit a bit string so this is a compression of a</p>
<p>108<br>00:14:13,680 –&gt; 00:14:20,240<br>tristructure so now the question is how do we there’s a lot of prefix-free codes how do we find</p>
<p>109<br>00:14:20,240 –&gt; 00:14:25,759<br>the best one well and there’s an idea called the shenan fanno algorithm which says</p>
<p>110<br>00:14:28,480 –&gt; 00:14:35,440<br>the key idea is that you’ve got characters that appear with different frequency and you want to</p>
<p>111<br>00:14:35,440 –&gt; 00:14:43,120<br>get the ones that appear very frequent to use fewer bits and so it’s of interest to find the ones</p>
<p>112<br>00:14:43,120 –&gt; 00:14:50,240<br>that are very frequent and so the shenan fanno algorithm says just divide all the symbols</p>
<p>113<br>00:14:50,240 –&gt; 00:14:57,600<br>into two roughly equal frequency and start the ones in the first one with zero and the ones in</p>
<p>114<br>00:14:57,600 –&gt; 00:15:08,320<br>the second one with one it’s kind of a balanced code and then kind of recur so if you have A appearing</p>
<p>115<br>00:15:08,320 –&gt; 00:15:13,760<br>five times and see it during one time that’s six for those and then you get six for all the</p>
<p>116<br>00:15:13,760 –&gt; 00:15:23,680<br>others and then you try to encode those with you try to use zeros for roughly half the character</p>
<p>117<br>00:15:23,680 –&gt; 00:15:30,560<br>in one for roughly half the character so in order to deal with that you have to figure out how to</p>
<p>118<br>00:15:30,560 –&gt; 00:15:36,000<br>divide up the symbols and you can imagine an algorithm for doing that but the real problem with</p>
<p>119<br>00:15:36,000 –&gt; 00:15:43,519<br>this method is that it’s not optimal and so that’s the kind of situation that</p>
<p>120<br>00:15:44,879 –&gt; 00:15:50,559<br>Huffman was faced with that way back when coming up with the algorithm and the best way to explain</p>
<p>121<br>00:15:50,559 –&gt; 00:15:57,200<br>the Huffman algorithm is through a demo and so that’s what we’ll do next here’s a demo of the Huffman</p>
<p>122<br>00:15:57,200 –&gt; 00:16:03,120<br>algorithm so the first thing that we do is count the frequency of each character in the input</p>
<p>123<br>00:16:03,919 –&gt; 00:16:10,799<br>and so that’s what the algorithm is based on so in this case there’s five A’s two B’s one C1D and so</p>
<p>124<br>00:16:10,799 –&gt; 00:16:22,399<br>forth so our goal is to use fewer bits to encode A and more bits to include CD and exclamation point</p>
<p>125<br>00:16:22,399 –&gt; 00:16:32,240<br>for example and we want a prefix-free code so it’s a kind of a bottom-up method so what we do is we</p>
<p>126<br>00:16:33,200 –&gt; 00:16:41,840<br>build one node for each character and we keep in the node corresponding to each character</p>
<p>127<br>00:16:41,840 –&gt; 00:16:49,759<br>a weight that’s equal to the frequency and then we imagine keeping them in sorted order so that’s</p>
<p>128<br>00:16:49,759 –&gt; 00:16:56,240<br>how the method starts out and remember our node representation had an instance variable that</p>
<p>129<br>00:16:56,879 –&gt; 00:17:04,799<br>allowed for storing these frequencies and then the idea is to given these are sub-trives of size</p>
<p>130<br>00:17:04,799 –&gt; 00:17:11,920<br>one the idea is to combine two of them and merge into a single tri with a cumulative weight</p>
<p>131<br>00:17:12,640 –&gt; 00:17:17,200<br>and so we’re going to find the ones that are the two that have the smallest weight</p>
<p>132<br>00:17:18,559 –&gt; 00:17:25,920<br>and create a new internal node for them in the way to that node is going to be the sum</p>
<p>133<br>00:17:26,240 –&gt; 00:17:34,240<br>of the two weights so that’s the frequency of all the code characters below it and then I just</p>
<p>134<br>00:17:34,240 –&gt; 00:17:45,759<br>put that into the mix so now we have five sub-trives to deal with and that’s the algorithm select the</p>
<p>135<br>00:17:45,759 –&gt; 00:17:52,880<br>two tries with minimum weight in this case since we’re keeping them sorted it’s always going to be the</p>
<p>136<br>00:17:52,880 –&gt; 00:18:00,080<br>ones on the left combine them and add their two weights so make a parent node it doesn’t matter</p>
<p>137<br>00:18:00,080 –&gt; 00:18:06,160<br>which goes on the left which goes right really and then add the weights to get the frequency of</p>
<p>138<br>00:18:06,160 –&gt; 00:18:15,920<br>the parent node and then put it into the list now if you look up at the table at the right what we’re</p>
<p>139<br>00:18:15,920 –&gt; 00:18:22,720<br>doing when we’re doing this combination is building up the code corresponding to the characters</p>
<p>140<br>00:18:24,000 –&gt; 00:18:30,640<br>moving from left to right so so far we know that the code for d is going to end in zero</p>
<p>141<br>00:18:31,120 –&gt; 00:18:37,200<br>and the code for c is going to end in one one and code for exclamation point is going to end in one zero</p>
<p>142<br>00:18:38,160 –&gt; 00:18:48,720<br>so now continue the rule now to be an argic combined and again we’re figuring out how those code</p>
<p>143<br>00:18:48,720 –&gt; 00:18:55,600<br>works end and so now we have just three to choose from now we’re going to combine the two big ones</p>
<p>144<br>00:18:57,120 –&gt; 00:19:05,440<br>and now we have new prefix bits for all of them and notice that our letter that appears with</p>
<p>145<br>00:19:05,440 –&gt; 00:19:12,960<br>highest frequency gets added in late which means it’s going to be near the root so now we have just the two</p>
<p>146<br>00:19:14,960 –&gt; 00:19:19,200<br>and we finish the algorithm there’s only two left now so we combine them</p>
<p>147<br>00:19:20,799 –&gt; 00:19:28,000<br>I merge into a single try and that corresponds to preventing a one to the codes for all the other</p>
<p>148<br>00:19:28,000 –&gt; 00:19:33,200<br>letters and just having a one bit code for a and that winds up with a single try</p>
<p>149<br>00:19:34,160 –&gt; 00:19:42,400<br>that’s a demo of huffman’s algorithm in operation so the huffman code is the answer to the question</p>
<p>150<br>00:19:42,400 –&gt; 00:19:49,039<br>of how to find the best prefix code that’s really very simple to describe count of frequency</p>
<p>151<br>00:19:49,840 –&gt; 00:19:55,920<br>for each character in the input you start with one node corresponding to each character with weight</p>
<p>152<br>00:19:55,920 –&gt; 00:20:02,720<br>given by its frequency and just until you have a single try you select the two with the minimum weight</p>
<p>153<br>00:20:02,720 –&gt; 00:20:08,720<br>and merge them into a single try by creating a new node with the weight sequel to some of the frequencies</p>
<p>154<br>00:20:10,079 –&gt; 00:20:18,160<br>this algorithm is used in many different and familiar compression applications from pdf to gzp</p>
<p>155<br>00:20:18,160 –&gt; 00:20:27,759<br>to np3 to jpeg in it’s pretty simple to code up in Java given the tools that algorithmic tools</p>
<p>156<br>00:20:27,759 –&gt; 00:20:36,000<br>that we’ve built up so what we’re going to do is this is after the frequencies have been computed</p>
<p>157<br>00:20:36,000 –&gt; 00:20:41,839<br>we’re going to build a try given the frequencies and we’re going to use a priority queue</p>
<p>158<br>00:20:42,640 –&gt; 00:20:47,839<br>in our generic priority queue we might as well put nodes on it we implemented a compare to method</p>
<p>159<br>00:20:48,640 –&gt; 00:20:55,279<br>all we need is the compare to to be able to build a priority queue from data of that type</p>
<p>160<br>00:20:55,519 –&gt; 00:21:02,799<br>so we have a priority queue of nodes and for all the possible character values if they appear in the</p>
<p>161<br>00:21:02,799 –&gt; 00:21:10,079<br>message they have a non-zero frequency I will just put a new node with the given frequency that’s a</p>
<p>162<br>00:21:10,079 –&gt; 00:21:17,680<br>leaf onto the priority queue and then the huffman algorithm is just as long as there’s more than one</p>
<p>163<br>00:21:17,680 –&gt; 00:21:25,680<br>node in the priority queue we pull off the smallest two nodes we create a new node that’s apparent</p>
<p>164<br>00:21:26,240 –&gt; 00:21:32,880<br>as character values not used we compute the total frequency of the sum of the two children</p>
<p>165<br>00:21:33,680 –&gt; 00:21:39,200<br>and we make those children of that node and then we put that back on the priority queue that’s it</p>
<p>166<br>00:21:39,200 –&gt; 00:21:45,519<br>take two off foot one on it reduces in size by one so this while loops eventually going to terminate</p>
<p>167<br>00:21:46,240 –&gt; 00:21:51,839<br>when it’s done there’s only one node on the priority queue and that’s the root of the try</p>
<p>168<br>00:21:52,960 –&gt; 00:21:59,039<br>extremely simple implementation of huffman’s algorithm using our generic priority queue</p>
<p>169<br>00:22:00,160 –&gt; 00:22:08,559<br>you can also implement it by pre-sorting the nodes as well but this is a particularly nice way to do</p>
<p>170<br>00:22:09,519 –&gt; 00:22:19,599<br>now you do have to prove that it produces an optimal code that’s in the sense that no code produces</p>
<p>171<br>00:22:19,599 –&gt; 00:22:27,200<br>uses fewer bits and that proof is in the book it’s not terribly difficult but we’re not going to</p>
<p>172<br>00:22:27,200 –&gt; 00:22:33,599<br>do it in lecture and that’s the huffman proved that in the 1950s so there’s no point in looking for</p>
<p>173<br>00:22:33,599 –&gt; 00:22:40,480<br>a better prefix-free code and prefix-free codes are so convenient because you don’t need to worry</p>
<p>174<br>00:22:40,480 –&gt; 00:22:53,039<br>about the ambiguity it’s a fine method that’s pretty easy to do so now what we have to do when</p>
<p>175<br>00:22:53,039 –&gt; 00:22:57,519<br>disadvantage of huffman that some of the methods don’t have is we have to have two passes through</p>
<p>176<br>00:22:57,519 –&gt; 00:23:03,119<br>the data we have to go through and read all the character frequencies and then build a try</p>
<p>177<br>00:23:04,000 –&gt; 00:23:10,000<br>and then we have to go back through the data and encode the file either traversing the try</p>
<p>178<br>00:23:10,000 –&gt; 00:23:18,240<br>from bottom up or using just a symbol table to look up the code for each symbol in the message</p>
<p>179<br>00:23:19,519 –&gt; 00:23:29,359<br>and the running time is pretty clear from the use of the try the try number characters and the</p>
<p>180<br>00:23:30,319 –&gt; 00:23:36,639<br>number of nodes in the try that’s just the alphabet size and so it’s going to be alphabet size log</p>
<p>181<br>00:23:36,639 –&gt; 00:23:44,079<br>r because each try operation might involve depth of log for use of heap implementation and then</p>
<p>182<br>00:23:44,559 –&gt; 00:23:56,240<br>have to have the for each character you have to do some kind of look up to a code and actually</p>
<p>183<br>00:23:56,240 –&gt; 00:24:02,960<br>the question is can we do better in terms of running time and well stay tuned we’ll look at a different</p>
<p>184<br>00:24:02,960 –&gt; 00:24:07,759<br>method that’s huffman compression</p>
