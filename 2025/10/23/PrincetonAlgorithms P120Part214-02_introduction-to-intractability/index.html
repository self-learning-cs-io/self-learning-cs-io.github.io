                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,160<br>Today we’re going to talk about interactability in our last lecture.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,160 –&gt; 00:00:13,759<br>This is an appropriate topic to close the course on because it really lays out for us some</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,759 –&gt; 00:00:17,039<br>of the big challenges of the future.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,039 –&gt; 00:00:21,559<br>Most people are taking this course because they’re going to want to be involved with algorithms</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,559 –&gt; 00:00:23,039<br>in the future.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:23,039 –&gt; 00:00:29,719<br>And this topic really helps us lay out what they had.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:29,719 –&gt; 00:00:38,119<br>As an introduction, we’ll review some very basic questions about computation.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:38,119 –&gt; 00:00:41,399<br>Some of you may be familiar with this subject area.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,399 –&gt; 00:00:42,560<br>Others may not be at all.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:42,560 –&gt; 00:00:46,280<br>So it will just be a brief review in either case.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,280 –&gt; 00:00:51,879<br>But some of the concepts are relatively easy to understand.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:51,879 –&gt; 00:00:57,039<br>And so they lay a good background first starting with computation, with interactability.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:57,039 –&gt; 00:01:01,079<br>We need to think about computation itself first.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:01,079 –&gt; 00:01:06,879<br>And there are these kinds of questions that came up actually about the same time or even</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:06,879 –&gt; 00:01:11,480<br>before computers actually were invented or came into use.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:11,480 –&gt; 00:01:13,039<br>What is a general purpose computer?</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:13,039 –&gt; 00:01:14,960<br>What does that mean?</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:14,960 –&gt; 00:01:18,560<br>Are there limits on the power of digital computers?</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:18,560 –&gt; 00:01:20,960<br>That’s another interesting question.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:20,960 –&gt; 00:01:26,120<br>Are there limits on the power of any machine that we can build?</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:26,120 –&gt; 00:01:33,079<br>This kind of question was the outgrowth of similar questions on mathematics that were</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:33,079 –&gt; 00:01:38,200<br>posed by David Hilbert in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:38,200 –&gt; 00:01:44,360<br>And there were some very profound thinking going on around Hilbert’s questions.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:44,360 –&gt; 00:01:50,640<br>And then later around the questions on computers that initially were related but then took</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:50,640 –&gt; 00:01:54,520<br>on a new life of their own.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:54,519 –&gt; 00:02:00,840<br>Now to take a look at the idea of what these mathematicians were thinking about in the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:00,840 –&gt; 00:02:08,879<br>middle of the 20th century, recall the simple model of computation that we looked at when</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:08,879 –&gt; 00:02:12,439<br>we were working with the Knuth-Morris Pratt algorithm.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:12,439 –&gt; 00:02:20,919<br>So what we did was we imagined a machine, an abstract machine called a discrete finite</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:20,919 –&gt; 00:02:25,679<br>automaton or an FSA finite state of automaton.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:25,679 –&gt; 00:02:30,399<br>That is a very simple machine where we imagine that it’s got a tape that has the input.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:30,399 –&gt; 00:02:32,879<br>That’s just a long strip that’s divided into cells.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:32,879 –&gt; 00:02:35,879<br>We’ve got a finite alphabet of symbols.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:35,879 –&gt; 00:02:43,000<br>And it had a tape head that could read one symbol from one cell of the tape and then based</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:43,000 –&gt; 00:02:45,119<br>on what it saw it would move to a different state.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:45,119 –&gt; 00:02:49,079<br>It would move one cell at a time and read up all the tape, all the input.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:49,080 –&gt; 00:02:51,800<br>And I forgot to the right state would say it accepted.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:51,800 –&gt; 00:02:53,800<br>That’s what we did with Knuth-Morris Pratt.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:53,800 –&gt; 00:03:00,520<br>We imagined this machine and then we built a program that constructed a table which just</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:00,520 –&gt; 00:03:07,840<br>said what to do, which state to go to for each symbol on the tape for each state.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:07,840 –&gt; 00:03:12,720<br>And then that was a way that we got this problem solved.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:13,719 –&gt; 00:03:20,080<br>The natural question arises when mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists first started</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:20,080 –&gt; 00:03:24,280<br>taking a look at abstract models of computation like this.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:24,280 –&gt; 00:03:26,120<br>Can you make them more powerful?</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:26,120 –&gt; 00:03:30,759<br>Is there a more powerful model of computation than a DFA?</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:30,759 –&gt; 00:03:36,639<br>Well it didn’t take long to realize, of course, there’s a more powerful model.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:36,639 –&gt; 00:03:40,520<br>And actually the progress was almost incremental.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:40,520 –&gt; 00:03:42,640<br>You could think of it as being almost incremental.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:42,640 –&gt; 00:03:46,240<br>We just add a little bit of power to the DFA.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:46,240 –&gt; 00:03:48,840<br>Now you can show that.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:48,840 –&gt; 00:03:53,600<br>That makes that more powerful, but what’s the limit?</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:53,600 –&gt; 00:04:03,600<br>And actually the limit was proposed very early on by Turing in here Princeton in the 1930s.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:03,599 –&gt; 00:04:11,859<br>It’s a universal model of computation where just like the DFA, we imagine a machine that</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:11,859 –&gt; 00:04:14,719<br>has a finite set of states.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:14,719 –&gt; 00:04:20,439<br>But instead of just reading the tape, it can write on the tape as well and it can move</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:20,439 –&gt; 00:04:22,879<br>in both directions.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:22,879 –&gt; 00:04:28,480<br>So it can store intermediate results on the tape.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:28,480 –&gt; 00:04:35,600<br>But other than that, it’s very similar to what we imagined for the FSA.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:35,600 –&gt; 00:04:41,280<br>And now the question is, is there a more powerful model of computation than this one?</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:41,280 –&gt; 00:04:50,300<br>And the remarkable fact is that Turing, the answer to this question in the 1930s, actually</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:50,300 –&gt; 00:04:56,000<br>did the work just before he got here to Princeton and then finished the paper, is that no,</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:56,000 –&gt; 00:04:58,560<br>there’s no more powerful model of computation.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:58,560 –&gt; 00:05:05,240<br>In fact, many have hailed this as the most important scientific result of the 20th century.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:05,240 –&gt; 00:05:11,319<br>Because it tells us really what we need to know about the power of the machines that we</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:11,319 –&gt; 00:05:13,519<br>build.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:13,519 –&gt; 00:05:21,720<br>So with church who was Turing’s advisor here at Princeton, we have the thesis that there’s</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:21,720 –&gt; 00:05:23,760<br>no more powerful machine.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:23,760 –&gt; 00:05:29,400<br>Turing machines can compute any function that can be computed by a physically harnessable</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:29,400 –&gt; 00:05:31,960<br>process of a natural world.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:31,960 –&gt; 00:05:36,960<br>Now this is not a mathematical theorem because it’s a statement about the natural world.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:36,960 –&gt; 00:05:42,880<br>It’s not something that you can prove from basic principles, but it is something that you</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:42,880 –&gt; 00:05:48,160<br>can falsify and run experiments and show it not to be true.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:48,160 –&gt; 00:05:55,920<br>And the whole idea behind this thesis and behind Turing’s proof of our abstract models</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:55,920 –&gt; 00:06:01,160<br>of computation is that, and we’ve seen it many, many times, we can use simulation to</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:01,160 –&gt; 00:06:03,080<br>prove models equivalent.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:03,080 –&gt; 00:06:07,840<br>So we wrote a Java program to simulate a discrete finite automaton.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:07,840 –&gt; 00:06:12,440<br>That means that Java’s at least as powerful as that.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:12,439 –&gt; 00:06:19,439<br>You can write people have shown you can write Turing machines that simulate the operation</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:19,439 –&gt; 00:06:24,639<br>of store program computers like the ones that we use.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:24,639 –&gt; 00:06:28,920<br>Or if you use an iPhone and you’re running an app that’s written for the Android or vice</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:28,920 –&gt; 00:06:33,959<br>versa, that’s simulation that proves models or equivalents, demonstrates that models are</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:33,959 –&gt; 00:06:34,959<br>equivalent.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:34,959 –&gt; 00:06:40,159<br>And that’s been an extremely effective way for us to understand that different computers</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:40,159 –&gt; 00:06:42,399<br>have similar capabilities.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:42,399 –&gt; 00:06:48,239<br>That you’re not going to compute more by building some new machine.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:48,239 –&gt; 00:06:55,959<br>So these had profound implications and it’s really amazing that Turing came up with this</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:55,959 –&gt; 00:07:00,560<br>so long ago when I read it before, computers came into use at all.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:00,560 –&gt; 00:07:06,719<br>And it means that we don’t have to try to invent a more powerful machine or language.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:06,720 –&gt; 00:07:13,440<br>And it really enables a rigorous study of the computation that we can expect to do in</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:13,440 –&gt; 00:07:15,960<br>a natural world.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:15,960 –&gt; 00:07:19,400<br>So that’s the basis for the theory of computation.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:19,400 –&gt; 00:07:27,360<br>And it’s related to the study of algorithms because it gives us a simple and universal model</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:27,360 –&gt; 00:07:28,680<br>of computation.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:28,680 –&gt; 00:07:32,640<br>But we haven’t talked about efficiency.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:32,639 –&gt; 00:07:39,360<br>How long does it take a simulator on the Android to simulate an iPhone and so forth?</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:39,360 –&gt; 00:07:41,759<br>So what about cost?</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:41,759 –&gt; 00:07:42,759<br>What about time?</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:42,759 –&gt; 00:07:46,120<br>That’s been our focus when developing algorithms.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:46,120 –&gt; 00:07:52,519<br>And what we want to think about next is how to deal with that cost.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:52,519 –&gt; 00:07:58,079<br>But first, I just want to lay out the evidence that we have for the Church Turing thesis.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:58,079 –&gt; 00:08:04,800<br>It’s been eight decades and nobody found a machine that can compute more than we’ve</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:04,800 –&gt; 00:08:07,680<br>been computing with the machines that we have.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:07,680 –&gt; 00:08:12,399<br>And the other thing that was really convincing to the mathematicians in the mid-20th century</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:12,399 –&gt; 00:08:18,240<br>is that people tried all different types of models of computation.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:18,240 –&gt; 00:08:22,639<br>There was a church was working on something called the Untiped Limb that calculus, which</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:22,639 –&gt; 00:08:26,319<br>actually is the basis for modern programming languages.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:26,319 –&gt; 00:08:32,480<br>And there were other mathematicians working on recursive function theory and on grammars</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:32,480 –&gt; 00:08:33,919<br>and other things.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:33,919 –&gt; 00:08:42,600<br>And eventually, essentially, they were all able to use these languages to express the formalism</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:42,600 –&gt; 00:08:47,399<br>of another one and then therefore prove them to be all equivalent.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:47,399 –&gt; 00:08:52,159<br>And that comes in through to the modern day with all programming languages.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:52,159 –&gt; 00:08:58,000<br>You can write a simulator or compiler for one programming language and another or a different</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:58,000 –&gt; 00:09:06,639<br>random access machine, simple machines like cellular automata and even computing using biological</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:06,639 –&gt; 00:09:12,759<br>operations on DNA or quantum computers that you may have heard about.</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:12,759 –&gt; 00:09:15,839<br>All of these things have turned out to be equivalent.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:15,840 –&gt; 00:09:24,240<br>So there’s a lot of confidence that the church turned these as whole.</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:24,240 –&gt; 00:09:26,040<br>But what about efficiency?</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:26,040 –&gt; 00:09:30,800<br>So this is a similar starting point for the study of algorithms.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:30,800 –&gt; 00:09:34,600<br>What algorithms are useful in practice?</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:34,600 –&gt; 00:09:40,639<br>So in order to know what useful we’re going to consider time and we’re going to say that</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:40,639 –&gt; 00:09:47,480<br>it’s an algorithm that it’s not just that it’s in theory would complete the problem</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:47,480 –&gt; 00:09:53,639<br>and say it actually would solve the problem in other time that we have available.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:53,639 –&gt; 00:10:03,679<br>And just to set a dividing line, a clear, bright line, we’re going to say is that we’ll</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:03,679 –&gt; 00:10:07,240<br>consider to be useful in practice or efficient.</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:07,240 –&gt; 00:10:12,799<br>If it’s running time, it’s guaranteed to be bounded by some polynomial in the size</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:12,799 –&gt; 00:10:15,919<br>of the input for all inputs.</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:15,919 –&gt; 00:10:20,799<br>And for the purpose of this theory, we don’t even care what the exponent is.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:20,799 –&gt; 00:10:23,440<br>It could be into the 100th.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:23,440 –&gt; 00:10:29,639<br>Now you might argue that’s not a very useful dividing line, but it is a useful starting point.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:29,639 –&gt; 00:10:34,799<br>And as you’ll see, even this starting point has told us a great deal about the kinds</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:34,799 –&gt; 00:10:38,919<br>of algorithms that are useful in practice.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:38,919 –&gt; 00:10:47,719<br>And this work was started in the 50s, also here at Princeton.</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:47,719 –&gt; 00:10:57,159<br>And many, many people looked at models for trying to understand what this meant.</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:57,159 –&gt; 00:11:05,719<br>The dividing line is between polynomial, as I said, an exponential is a 2 to the</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:05,719 –&gt; 00:11:09,759<br>nth power, some constant greater than 1 to the nth power.</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:09,759 –&gt; 00:11:13,360<br>And we’ll talk about that in just a second.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:13,360 –&gt; 00:11:15,600<br>So sorting is useful.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:15,600 –&gt; 00:11:20,039<br>It’s running time is bounded by a polynomial.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:20,039 –&gt; 00:11:30,000<br>But here’s another one, which is finding the best traveling salesperson tour on endpoints.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:30,000 –&gt; 00:11:35,360<br>If you’re going to try all possible tours, that algorithm is not useful in practice because</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:35,360 –&gt; 00:11:42,319<br>the n factorial is not bounded by a polynomial in an it’s running time actually grows like</p>
<p>142<br>00:11:42,319 –&gt; 00:11:44,399<br>n to the nth.</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:44,399 –&gt; 00:11:50,919<br>So this is a useful starting point for our theory because it’s very broad and robust.</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:50,919 –&gt; 00:11:56,319<br>And if we can put some algorithms in the class with sorting and other algorithms in the class</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:56,319 –&gt; 00:12:01,679<br>with traveling salesperson using brute brute force search, that’s going to be useful.</p>
<p>146<br>00:12:01,679 –&gt; 00:12:04,519<br>It’ll tell us which algorithms we want to use.</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:04,519 –&gt; 00:12:08,519<br>We definitely can use the think about using the first, but we can’t think about using the</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:08,519 –&gt; 00:12:11,960<br>second.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:11,960 –&gt; 00:12:18,080<br>And actually, unlike touring machines where we wouldn’t actually contemplate using a</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:18,080 –&gt; 00:12:23,840<br>touring machine to solve a practical problem in this theory, it’s often the case that</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:23,840 –&gt; 00:12:29,840<br>polynomial time algorithms will scale to help us solve large problems because the constants</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:29,840 –&gt; 00:12:32,840<br>usually tend to be small.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:32,840 –&gt; 00:12:37,519<br>But the key is the idea of exponential growth.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:37,519 –&gt; 00:12:44,439<br>And I just want to be sure to convince everybody that it’s not about when it comes to exponential</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:44,439 –&gt; 00:12:47,159<br>growth, it’s not about the technology.</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:47,159 –&gt; 00:12:52,079<br>That is a dividing line that no matter how fast your computer is, you can’t be running</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:52,079 –&gt; 00:12:56,240<br>an exponential algorithm and expect to be solving a large problem.</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:56,240 –&gt; 00:13:00,279<br>And just a thought experiment to re-convince everybody of that.</p>
<p>159<br>00:13:00,279 –&gt; 00:13:06,720<br>So let’s suppose that imagine that we had a huge giant parallel computing device.</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:06,720 –&gt; 00:13:14,720<br>This thing is so big that it’s got as many processors as there are electrons in the universe.</p>
<p>161<br>00:13:14,720 –&gt; 00:13:18,560<br>So we have a supercomputer on every electron.</p>
<p>162<br>00:13:18,560 –&gt; 00:13:24,080<br>And we’ll put the most powerful supercomputer we can imagine today on every electron in</p>
<p>163<br>00:13:24,080 –&gt; 00:13:25,759<br>the universe.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:25,759 –&gt; 00:13:32,480<br>And then we’ll also run each processor for the life time, estimated lifetime of the universe.</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:32,480 –&gt; 00:13:35,200<br>So how big a problem can we solve?</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:35,200 –&gt; 00:13:41,080<br>Well, it’s estimated there’s 10 to the 79 electrons in the universe in supercomputers</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:41,080 –&gt; 00:13:42,080<br>nowadays.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:42,080 –&gt; 00:13:45,560<br>Maybe we can do 10 to the 13th instructions per second.</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:45,560 –&gt; 00:13:50,120<br>And you can quote about these numbers and make it 10 to the 20th if you want.</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:50,120 –&gt; 00:13:53,120<br>It’s estimated the age of the universe in seconds is 10 to the 17th.</p>
<p>171<br>00:13:53,120 –&gt; 00:13:56,560<br>And if you don’t like that, make it 10 to the 30th.</p>
<p>172<br>00:13:56,560 –&gt; 00:14:00,240<br>You multiply all those numbers together.</p>
<p>173<br>00:14:00,240 –&gt; 00:14:07,600<br>We’re going to get a relatively small number to say 1,000 factorial.</p>
<p>174<br>00:14:07,600 –&gt; 00:14:15,560<br>10 to the 17th times 10 to the 17th times 10 to the 79th is only 10 to the 10 to the 109th</p>
<p>175<br>00:14:15,560 –&gt; 00:14:16,560<br>or something.</p>
<p>176<br>00:14:16,560 –&gt; 00:14:20,200<br>Where’s 1,000 factorial is way bigger than 10 to the 1000th?</p>
<p>177<br>00:14:20,200 –&gt; 00:14:23,200<br>It’s more like 1,000 to the 1000th.</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:23,200 –&gt; 00:14:29,560<br>So there’s no way that you can imagine solving 1,000 city TSP problem using that brute force</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:29,559 –&gt; 00:14:30,559<br>algorithm.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:30,559 –&gt; 00:14:35,000<br>You can let your computer run, but it’s not going to finish.</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:35,000 –&gt; 00:14:38,119<br>Technology is out of the picture when we have exponential growth.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:38,119 –&gt; 00:14:42,479<br>So that’s why it’s so important to know which algorithms are going to require exponential</p>
<p>183<br>00:14:42,479 –&gt; 00:14:44,959<br>time and which ones aren’t.</p>
<p>184<br>00:14:44,959 –&gt; 00:14:52,319<br>In this theory, it would seem, let’s at least get that classification done.</p>
<p>185<br>00:14:52,319 –&gt; 00:14:54,159<br>So which problems can we solve in practice?</p>
<p>186<br>00:14:54,159 –&gt; 00:14:58,759<br>We’re just going to say that the polynomial time algorithms are the ones that we can solve</p>
<p>187<br>00:14:58,759 –&gt; 00:15:03,159<br>in practice and that guaranteed polynomial time performance.</p>
<p>188<br>00:15:03,159 –&gt; 00:15:08,799<br>So that brings us right to the question which problems have polynomial time algorithms.</p>
<p>189<br>00:15:08,799 –&gt; 00:15:13,879<br>And unfortunately, it’s not so easy to know that.</p>
<p>190<br>00:15:13,879 –&gt; 00:15:19,600<br>It’s stuck right away on trying to do that classification.</p>
<p>191<br>00:15:19,600 –&gt; 00:15:25,399<br>And that’s what today’s lecture is all about.</p>
<p>192<br>00:15:25,399 –&gt; 00:15:34,319<br>So this is a similar bird’s eye view to when we introduced a classifying algorithms when</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:34,319 –&gt; 00:15:35,519<br>we were talking about reduction.</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:35,519 –&gt; 00:15:39,840<br>And reduction is a very important tool in this theory as well.</p>
<p>195<br>00:15:39,840 –&gt; 00:15:44,279<br>So what we’re going to say is a problem is interactable if you can’t guarantee the</p>
<p>196<br>00:15:44,279 –&gt; 00:15:46,919<br>insolven polynomial time.</p>
<p>197<br>00:15:46,919 –&gt; 00:15:51,199<br>So what we want to do is prove that a problem is interactable.</p>
<p>198<br>00:15:51,200 –&gt; 00:15:57,400<br>There have been a couple of problems that have been proven to require exponential times.</p>
<p>199<br>00:15:57,400 –&gt; 00:16:00,200<br>But they’re a bit artificial.</p>
<p>200<br>00:16:00,200 –&gt; 00:16:02,080<br>Well, so here’s one.</p>
<p>201<br>00:16:02,080 –&gt; 00:16:08,120<br>Given the constant size program, does it halt in at most case steps?</p>
<p>202<br>00:16:08,120 –&gt; 00:16:11,040<br>Or is another one given an N by N checkers board?</p>
<p>203<br>00:16:11,040 –&gt; 00:16:15,160<br>Can the first player force a win if you have the force capture rule?</p>
<p>204<br>00:16:15,159 –&gt; 00:16:21,319<br>Well, N by N checkers board for large N is again, that’s certainly a toy problem.</p>
<p>205<br>00:16:21,319 –&gt; 00:16:26,639<br>But for many of the real problems that we actually would write this like the solve, unfortunately,</p>
<p>206<br>00:16:26,639 –&gt; 00:16:32,279<br>there’s been very few successes in proving that a problem is interactable.</p>
<p>207<br>00:16:32,279 –&gt; 00:16:37,659<br>So even though it would seem that you should be able to be able to separate problems that</p>
<p>208<br>00:16:37,659 –&gt; 00:16:43,240<br>can guarantee polynomial time solutions from problems that require exponential times for</p>
<p>209<br>00:16:43,240 –&gt; 00:16:44,959<br>some input.</p>
<p>210<br>00:16:44,960 –&gt; 00:16:49,200<br>And there’s been very little success in proving that.</p>
<p>211<br>00:16:49,200 –&gt; 00:16:52,680<br>But that’s an introduction and a motivation for the theory of interactability.</p>
