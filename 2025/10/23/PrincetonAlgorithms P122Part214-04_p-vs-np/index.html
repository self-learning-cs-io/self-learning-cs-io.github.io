                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,480<br>Now we’re going to talk about P and NP, the two major classes of problems that form the</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,480 –&gt; 00:00:13,839<br>basis for the theory of interactability.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,839 –&gt; 00:00:19,679<br>And so we talked about search problems, and what we’re going to do is just name that class</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,679 –&gt; 00:00:20,679<br>of problems.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:20,679 –&gt; 00:00:23,679<br>And that’s what we call NP.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:23,679 –&gt; 00:00:27,679<br>NP is the class of all search problems.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:27,679 –&gt; 00:00:33,899<br>And now I just want to mention again that the classic definition that’s often used in</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:33,899 –&gt; 00:00:39,200<br>many books and papers that you’ll read about this topic, the classic definition limits</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:39,200 –&gt; 00:00:41,280<br>NP to yes, no problems.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:41,280 –&gt; 00:00:47,600<br>But again, the major conclusions that we draw are exactly the same.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:47,600 –&gt; 00:00:54,240<br>So we just listed a bunch of problems that are in NP.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:54,240 –&gt; 00:01:01,200<br>And the way that we know is we had a very concrete definition of what we mean by a search</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:01,200 –&gt; 00:01:02,200<br>problem.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:02,200 –&gt; 00:01:04,400<br>You have to be able to give a solution.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:04,400 –&gt; 00:01:10,520<br>You have to be able to verify and guarantee polynomial time that you have a solution.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:10,520 –&gt; 00:01:18,719<br>And for satisfiability problems that we consider, in fact, are all in the class NP.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,719 –&gt; 00:01:24,640<br>So we’re using the concept of a search problem to classify some problems.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:24,640 –&gt; 00:01:31,200<br>One way to think of NP is it’s really what we would like to be able to compute.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,200 –&gt; 00:01:37,960<br>We’d like to have algorithms that solve all of these problems.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:37,960 –&gt; 00:01:43,280<br>And it’s a very, very general class of problems.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,280 –&gt; 00:01:52,599<br>It’s almost articulating in as general a way as possible what we mean by a problem that</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:52,599 –&gt; 00:01:54,200<br>we want to solve computationally.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:54,200 –&gt; 00:01:57,120<br>So these are the problems that we’d like to solve.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:57,120 –&gt; 00:02:00,079<br>Some of them we can, we know how to solve some of them.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:00,079 –&gt; 00:02:01,319<br>We don’t.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:01,319 –&gt; 00:02:04,840<br>That’s NP.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:04,840 –&gt; 00:02:12,080<br>Now by contrast, there’s another class P where we add a restriction.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:13,080 –&gt; 00:02:18,520<br>That’s the class of search problems that we know how to solve in polynomial time.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:18,520 –&gt; 00:02:25,680<br>That is we have, generally, we have, we prove that a problem is NP by demonstrating the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:25,680 –&gt; 00:02:32,280<br>algorithm that is guaranteed to run in polynomial time for any instance of that problem.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:32,280 –&gt; 00:02:36,600<br>And again, the classic definition is about yes, no problems.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:36,600 –&gt; 00:02:41,200<br>So here’s a bunch of problems that are NP.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:41,199 –&gt; 00:02:47,000<br>And so we already showed L solve because Gaussian elimination runs in polynomial time.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:47,000 –&gt; 00:02:51,799<br>And we already talked about LP because it’s gotcha in the algorithm that works for linear</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:51,799 –&gt; 00:02:52,799<br>programming.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:52,799 –&gt; 00:02:59,560<br>And then pretty much all the algorithms that we’ve covered in this course are cast as search</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:59,560 –&gt; 00:03:06,319<br>problems and also have polynomial time solutions.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:06,319 –&gt; 00:03:13,319<br>We’ve been talking about programs that are polynomial time solutions and just a little</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:13,319 –&gt; 00:03:20,879<br>bit has to be done to convince yourself that or to cast the problem as a search problem.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:20,879 –&gt; 00:03:26,319<br>Many of them are explicit search problems like ST connectivity, you’re searching for</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:26,319 –&gt; 00:03:32,560<br>a path in a graph, you know, in TCS in the miniatur, you know, showed if you are given</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:32,560 –&gt; 00:03:35,240<br>a path, you can check that it’s a path easily.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:35,240 –&gt; 00:03:37,360<br>So it’s a search problem.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:37,360 –&gt; 00:03:42,319<br>So a piece of the class of search problems that can be solvable in polynomial time.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:42,319 –&gt; 00:03:48,039<br>So the significance of P is those are the ones that we actually do compute feasibly.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:48,039 –&gt; 00:03:53,199<br>So NP is the ones, all the ones we would like to and P is all the ones that we actually</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:53,199 –&gt; 00:03:55,840<br>do compute feasibly.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:55,840 –&gt; 00:04:01,120<br>And those are perfectly well defined classes of problems.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:01,120 –&gt; 00:04:03,680<br>Now what is the N and N to P for?</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:03,680 –&gt; 00:04:08,879<br>Well, just a brief moment to talk about that.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:08,879 –&gt; 00:04:12,920<br>The N and N piece stands for non-determinism.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:12,920 –&gt; 00:04:20,439<br>And the idea of a non-deterministic machine is one that can guess the desired solution.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:20,439 –&gt; 00:04:22,199<br>And that’s an abstract machine.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:22,199 –&gt; 00:04:28,840<br>As far as we know, we don’t have non-determinism in real life devices.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:28,839 –&gt; 00:04:32,479<br>But for this, find to have an abstract machine of that sort.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:32,479 –&gt; 00:04:38,279<br>Remember for our implementation for regular expression pattern matching.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:38,279 –&gt; 00:04:44,239<br>The way that we solved that practical problem was to imagine a non-deterministic machine</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:44,239 –&gt; 00:04:53,120<br>and then write a program that would simulate that machine by trying all different possibilities.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:53,120 –&gt; 00:05:01,959<br>And in fact, that whole exercise really gets at the difference between polynomial and exponential</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:01,959 –&gt; 00:05:03,639<br>time.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:03,639 –&gt; 00:05:11,360<br>First approach is a naive approach to simulating that machine turns out to be an algorithm</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:11,360 –&gt; 00:05:13,920<br>that can run an exponential time for some inputs.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:13,920 –&gt; 00:05:19,360<br>And we actually saw that today there’s implementations like that out there that hackers can exploit</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:19,360 –&gt; 00:05:21,759<br>to deny service.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:21,759 –&gt; 00:05:26,439<br>And implementation we show had guarantees polynomial time.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:26,439 –&gt; 00:05:32,800<br>So non-determinism was an abstract device that we used to help us try to get to a real</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:32,800 –&gt; 00:05:34,599<br>practical solution.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:34,599 –&gt; 00:05:36,519<br>And that’s what we’re doing again.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:36,519 –&gt; 00:05:42,439<br>So let’s imagine we have a non-deterministic machine that can guess the solution.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:42,439 –&gt; 00:05:52,639<br>So like if you’re in a deterministic machine, if you make a array and create an array of</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:52,639 –&gt; 00:06:00,839<br>size n, then Java, we know deterministically, initializes the entries to all zero.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:00,839 –&gt; 00:06:06,519<br>But what if that array A is supposed to be our solution to an integer linear programming</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:06,519 –&gt; 00:06:08,399<br>problem?</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:08,399 –&gt; 00:06:12,079<br>We could have a non-deterministic machine initialize the entries to the solution.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:12,079 –&gt; 00:06:15,399<br>And it could just guess what the right answer is and initialize it.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:15,399 –&gt; 00:06:20,639<br>Who seems like a really, really powerful capability.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:20,639 –&gt; 00:06:27,120<br>So for example, for an integer linear programming, we could just tell the non-deterministic machine</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:27,120 –&gt; 00:06:31,279<br>I guess the solution and would be done.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:31,279 –&gt; 00:06:35,519<br>In the same concept goes all the way down to a Turing machine.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:35,519 –&gt; 00:06:41,839<br>The whole idea of a finite state machine or if any computation that people think about</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:41,839 –&gt; 00:06:47,120<br>is the machine’s in some state and it’s fully determined what the next state will be.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:47,120 –&gt; 00:06:53,879<br>And Turing machines, the simplest type of imaginary machine with that kind of capability.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:53,879 –&gt; 00:06:58,799<br>But it’s very simple to make a Turing machine non-deterministic the same way that we made</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:58,799 –&gt; 00:07:01,719<br>finite atomita non-deterministic.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:01,720 –&gt; 00:07:06,160<br>We just let it go to more than one possible state.</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:06,160 –&gt; 00:07:12,520<br>So when you think about non-determinism in this way, it’s pretty clear almost immediately</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:12,520 –&gt; 00:07:19,520<br>that NP is the class of search problems that are solvable in polynomial time on a non-deterministic</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:19,520 –&gt; 00:07:21,600<br>Turing machine.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:21,600 –&gt; 00:07:26,640<br>Even if the machine gives the solution what we’re requiring is that we have to be able to</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:26,640 –&gt; 00:07:30,360<br>check that it’s a solution in polynomial time.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:30,360 –&gt; 00:07:32,680<br>And that’s NP.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:32,680 –&gt; 00:07:43,680<br>So what we have are led to immediately is what’s called the extended church Turing thesis.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:43,680 –&gt; 00:07:52,580<br>And that’s the idea that P is the ones that we know how to solve but it’s the class of</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:52,580 –&gt; 00:07:58,199<br>problems that we’re ever going to be able to solve in the natural world.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:58,199 –&gt; 00:08:04,240<br>And again, evidence for supporting the thesis is that all the computers that we know about</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:04,240 –&gt; 00:08:08,680<br>we simulate them in polynomial time.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:08,680 –&gt; 00:08:14,439<br>People wondered and have wondered and still wonder, is it possible that there are computers</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:14,439 –&gt; 00:08:21,599<br>out there that work differently or more efficiently than the computers that we’ve built?</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:21,599 –&gt; 00:08:25,279<br>Here’s an interesting and simple example.</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:25,279 –&gt; 00:08:29,399<br>There’s a thing called a Steiner Tree which is like an MST except you’re not restricted</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:29,399 –&gt; 00:08:32,879<br>to have your lines go through the points that are given.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:32,879 –&gt; 00:08:37,959<br>Steiner Tree you’re given some points and what you’re supposed to do is find a set of lines</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:37,959 –&gt; 00:08:41,319<br>of minimal length that connect the end points.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:41,319 –&gt; 00:08:45,799<br>Now this is quite a bit of math and geometry even to prove that a given set of lines is a</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:45,799 –&gt; 00:08:51,480<br>Steiner Tree but like for four points it’s known like this in a rectangular array.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:51,480 –&gt; 00:08:53,959<br>That’s what the Steiner Tree looks like.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:53,960 –&gt; 00:08:57,120<br>And we write a program to compute Steiner Tree.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:57,120 –&gt; 00:08:59,160<br>It’s a search problem.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:59,160 –&gt; 00:09:07,680<br>Although it’s not completely easy to characterize as a search problem that anybody is.</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:07,680 –&gt; 00:09:15,639<br>But anyway the point for now is that people wondered actually if you put soap in between</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:15,639 –&gt; 00:09:22,560<br>two glasses of film formed by the soap or soap bubbles is another way to think about it.</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:22,559 –&gt; 00:09:26,519<br>This is a tube making it two-dimensional.</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:26,519 –&gt; 00:09:31,199<br>If you put four points and put soap and people have done this experiment that’s the photo</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:31,199 –&gt; 00:09:35,759<br>off the web, you get a Steiner Tree.</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:35,759 –&gt; 00:09:41,119<br>And you know who knows what kind of computation is involved to make that.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:41,119 –&gt; 00:09:49,199<br>If you put lots of points people have done I don’t know what number but they can get Steiner</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:49,200 –&gt; 00:09:53,080<br>Tree for substantial numbers of points.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:53,080 –&gt; 00:09:55,879<br>Can we really compute Steiner Tree that way?</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:55,879 –&gt; 00:10:02,879<br>Well you can construct things where it doesn’t actually get the actual Steiner Tree so it</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:02,879 –&gt; 00:10:04,800<br>doesn’t really work.</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:04,800 –&gt; 00:10:07,120<br>And that’s just one example of an attempt.</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:07,120 –&gt; 00:10:11,480<br>There’s plenty of other examples out there.</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:11,480 –&gt; 00:10:17,940<br>But the extended search during thesis hasn’t been with us for as long as the search</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:17,940 –&gt; 00:10:25,300<br>during thesis and maybe it’s not quite as strong but it’s held for quite a long time.</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:25,300 –&gt; 00:10:30,620<br>And people are assuming that there’s not going to be a design that’s going to make the</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:30,620 –&gt; 00:10:36,020<br>difference between polynomial time in this natural world.</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:36,020 –&gt; 00:10:40,140<br>If we’re going to make future computers more efficient we’re just going to improve our</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:40,140 –&gt; 00:10:41,140<br>existing design.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:41,140 –&gt; 00:10:45,860<br>That’s the extended search during thesis.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:45,860 –&gt; 00:10:51,940<br>But all of this leads us with the basic question does P equal Np?</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:51,940 –&gt; 00:10:55,980<br>So P is all the problems we can solve in the natural world.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:55,980 –&gt; 00:10:59,860<br>Np is all the search problems that I would like to solve.</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:59,860 –&gt; 00:11:05,060<br>If we had non-determinism in the natural world, do we have non-determinism in the natural</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:05,060 –&gt; 00:11:06,060<br>world?</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:06,060 –&gt; 00:11:08,060<br>Does non-determinism help?</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:08,060 –&gt; 00:11:09,060<br>That’s the question.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:09,060 –&gt; 00:11:11,060<br>Does P equals Np?</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:11,059 –&gt; 00:11:17,379<br>This question has been around for a long time and has even made it into the popular culture.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:17,379 –&gt; 00:11:23,459<br>And I think it will make it into the popular culture much more when we start having because</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:23,459 –&gt; 00:11:28,979<br>we’re starting to have massive online courses where many more people are learning about</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:28,979 –&gt; 00:11:30,379<br>these fabulous concepts.</p>
<p>142<br>00:11:30,379 –&gt; 00:11:36,859<br>And here’s another way to think about P versus Np.</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:36,860 –&gt; 00:11:40,539<br>Like the idea of automating creativity.</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:40,539 –&gt; 00:11:43,139<br>There’s one thing to be creative.</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:43,139 –&gt; 00:11:46,940<br>It’s another thing to appreciate creativity.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:46,940 –&gt; 00:11:50,659<br>So Mozart comes up with a piece of music.</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:50,659 –&gt; 00:11:54,019<br>Once that thing is created, we can appreciate it.</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:54,019 –&gt; 00:12:00,700<br>Where Andrew Wiles proved from us last year in however he came up with it, there’s a way</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:00,700 –&gt; 00:12:01,700<br>to check it.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:01,700 –&gt; 00:12:09,060<br>Or somebody designs them in an airfoil or airplane wing.</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:09,060 –&gt; 00:12:13,500<br>We can verify that it has the properties that it’s supposed to.</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:13,500 –&gt; 00:12:15,300<br>Or Einstein proposes a theory.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:15,300 –&gt; 00:12:17,340<br>Somebody can validate it.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:17,340 –&gt; 00:12:19,980<br>So there’s the creative.</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:19,980 –&gt; 00:12:23,740<br>Let’s make something or come up with something.</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:23,740 –&gt; 00:12:25,580<br>That’s the antelogue.</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:25,580 –&gt; 00:12:31,340<br>To that is a solution to a problem, a search problem.</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:31,340 –&gt; 00:12:34,860<br>And the ordinary thing to do is to check it.</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:34,860 –&gt; 00:12:37,900<br>But if P equals Np, there’s no difference.</p>
<p>160<br>00:12:37,900 –&gt; 00:12:44,180<br>We can really like automating creativity.</p>
<p>161<br>00:12:44,180 –&gt; 00:12:47,620<br>That’s the computational antelogue to P equals Np.</p>
<p>162<br>00:12:47,620 –&gt; 00:12:52,740<br>Question is a computational antelogue to automating creativity.</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:52,740 –&gt; 00:12:54,100<br>This P equals Np.</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:54,100 –&gt; 00:12:57,700<br>That’s the central question.</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:57,700 –&gt; 00:13:02,419<br>Can you always avoid brute force searching in Dubeter?</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:02,419 –&gt; 00:13:07,840<br>For search problems, since we have a small solution that can be checked in polynomial</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:07,840 –&gt; 00:13:15,299<br>time, there’s always an exponential time solution, which is trial possible solutions.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:15,299 –&gt; 00:13:17,419<br>But that’s not the question.</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:17,419 –&gt; 00:13:19,259<br>Can you always do better than that?</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:19,259 –&gt; 00:13:27,659<br>Really, the essence of the P equals Np question.</p>
<p>171<br>00:13:27,659 –&gt; 00:13:29,419<br>So there’s two possibilities.</p>
<p>172<br>00:13:29,419 –&gt; 00:13:32,899<br>If P is not, so P is a search problem.</p>
<p>173<br>00:13:32,899 –&gt; 00:13:38,700<br>So certainly Np, any problem Np is also on P.</p>
<p>174<br>00:13:38,700 –&gt; 00:13:46,939<br>So the question is, are there some search problems that we can’t solve in polynomial time?</p>
<p>175<br>00:13:46,940 –&gt; 00:13:55,620<br>So if the answer to the question is yes, then all the problems that I’ve mentioned that nobody</p>
<p>176<br>00:13:55,620 –&gt; 00:14:00,780<br>knows the solution to despite people working on them for many decades.</p>
<p>177<br>00:14:00,780 –&gt; 00:14:06,740<br>If P is equal to Np, there’s polynomial times algorithms for those out there.</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:06,740 –&gt; 00:14:10,980<br>We just haven’t found them yet.</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:10,980 –&gt; 00:14:16,139<br>The answer to that is no.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:16,139 –&gt; 00:14:25,779<br>That’s really something fundamental about our universe.</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:25,779 –&gt; 00:14:33,019<br>Something that says something profound about the power of non-determinism.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:33,019 –&gt; 00:14:43,019<br>If P equals Np, non-determinism actually doesn’t help, P not equal Np, it would.</p>
<p>183<br>00:14:43,019 –&gt; 00:14:47,980<br>Now, the overwhelming consensus is that P equals not equal to Np.</p>
<p>184<br>00:14:47,980 –&gt; 00:14:54,340<br>And we’ll talk some more about some reasons that people believe that.</p>
<p>185<br>00:14:54,340 –&gt; 00:15:05,300<br>But thinking about it, you can really convince yourself that it really seems as though having a machine,</p>
<p>186<br>00:15:05,300 –&gt; 00:15:14,980<br>a machine that can, when you initialize an array, initialize it with solution to integer linear programming problem,</p>
<p>187<br>00:15:14,980 –&gt; 00:15:22,740<br>really would seem that a machine like that is going to be more powerful than the machines that we’re using.</p>
<p>188<br>00:15:22,740 –&gt; 00:15:27,419<br>And that’s why people believe that P is not equal to Np.</p>
<p>189<br>00:15:27,419 –&gt; 00:15:33,820<br>But the frustrating thing is that theoretical computer scientists and mathematicians have been working on this for many, many years,</p>
<p>190<br>00:15:33,820 –&gt; 00:15:37,899<br>and no one has been able to prove it.</p>
<p>191<br>00:15:37,899 –&gt; 00:15:41,740<br>Actually, there’s the millennium prize.</p>
<p>192<br>00:15:41,740 –&gt; 00:15:50,259<br>You can earn a million dollars from playing mathematics if you resolve P equals Np.</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:50,259 –&gt; 00:15:57,220<br>Actually, there’s other math problems on that list.</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:57,220 –&gt; 00:16:04,819<br>But people who know algorithms, first of all, you could learn way more than a million dollars if you resolve this problem.</p>
<p>195<br>00:16:04,819 –&gt; 00:16:10,980<br>Second of all, if you’re expert in algorithms, there’s lots of other ways to earn a million dollars.</p>
<p>196<br>00:16:10,980 –&gt; 00:16:14,059<br>So it’s not about the million dollars it’s about.</p>
<p>197<br>00:16:14,059 –&gt; 00:16:22,379<br>This is some would argue one of the most important open mathematical questions that faces us right now.</p>
