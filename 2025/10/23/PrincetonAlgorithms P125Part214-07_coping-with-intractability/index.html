                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,960<br>Okay, we’re going to finish up by talking a little bit about different approaches to dealing</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,960 –&gt; 00:00:14,560<br>with meaning to solve intractable problems.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,560 –&gt; 00:00:21,240<br>There’s actually a lot of different ways to proceed when you run into an intractable problem.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:21,240 –&gt; 00:00:23,240<br>One idea is to exploit it.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,240 –&gt; 00:00:29,640<br>In fact, an example of this, a very successful example of this is modern cryptography.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,640 –&gt; 00:00:38,359<br>So, and people using the internet for commerce or for interaction through digital signatures</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:38,359 –&gt; 00:00:48,480<br>and other mechanisms are absolutely relying on modern cryptography for security and privacy.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:48,480 –&gt; 00:00:53,120<br>And that’s all based on the RSA cryptosystem or much of it.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:53,119 –&gt; 00:01:03,079<br>And it’s based on the idea that multiplying to in-bit integers is relatively easy as brute force</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:03,079 –&gt; 00:01:07,679<br>multiplication algorithm to get the done in quadratic time in this faster way.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:07,679 –&gt; 00:01:10,519<br>So, that’s polynomial time.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:10,519 –&gt; 00:01:13,679<br>So, in order to encrypt something, you need to multiply things.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:13,679 –&gt; 00:01:17,120<br>When in order to break something, you would need to factor things.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:17,120 –&gt; 00:01:20,599<br>So, that’s exploiting intractability.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:20,599 –&gt; 00:01:24,000<br>Nobody knows a good way to factor.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:24,000 –&gt; 00:01:26,559<br>The factor is not in peak complete, by the way.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:26,559 –&gt; 00:01:28,359<br>Not known to be incomplete.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:28,359 –&gt; 00:01:36,239<br>So, it’s not quite as hard as other problems, but still nobody knows a fast way.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:36,239 –&gt; 00:01:45,879<br>So, this is an example of exploiting suspected problem that’s suspected to be intractable.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:46,280 –&gt; 00:01:50,679<br>In fact, there’s other ways to make money.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:50,679 –&gt; 00:02:00,879<br>Revesht Shavir and Aylman put up some challenges and go ahead and factor this number towards $30,000.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:00,879 –&gt; 00:02:06,319<br>Some of these things have been prices have already been claimed, but that’s maybe easier.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:06,319 –&gt; 00:02:10,599<br>I had to go up to this and after the million.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:10,599 –&gt; 00:02:21,159<br>And actually, Revesht Shavir and Aylman were just not just, but they were professors at MIT when they came up with this.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:21,159 –&gt; 00:02:36,240<br>And they realized that the important commercial potential of this in actually created a company based on the difficulty of factoring that sold for $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:36,240 –&gt; 00:02:41,240<br>Not that long ago, in a some basis for internet commerce.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:41,240 –&gt; 00:02:52,240<br>So, these possibilities for making a lot of money out of understanding the difficulty of computation are not imaginary.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:52,240 –&gt; 00:02:56,240<br>They’re quite real.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:56,240 –&gt; 00:03:03,240<br>So, I talked briefly about the complexity of factor.</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:03,240 –&gt; 00:03:07,240<br>That’s another problem like LP.</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:07,240 –&gt; 00:03:13,240<br>It’s current status is what LP was in the 70s.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:13,240 –&gt; 00:03:16,240<br>We’re using it, a lot of people were doing it.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:16,240 –&gt; 00:03:20,240<br>We knew that the worst case of simplex was exponential.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:20,240 –&gt; 00:03:25,240<br>I would like to classify like the no-fis of polym at the time algorithm, but nobody knew one.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:25,240 –&gt; 00:03:32,240<br>And then the big surprise for LP was that catching came up with a polym at the time algorithm.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:32,240 –&gt; 00:03:37,240<br>And then people went to work for factor.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:37,240 –&gt; 00:03:40,240<br>We’re kind of in the same situation.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:40,240 –&gt; 00:03:45,240<br>It’s in NP, as we saw, it’s just a search problem.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:45,240 –&gt; 00:03:50,240<br>But it’s not known or believed to be either NP or NP complete.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:50,240 –&gt; 00:03:53,240<br>But again, who knows?</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:53,240 –&gt; 00:03:57,240<br>So, what if it turns out that P equals NP?</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:57,240 –&gt; 00:04:00,240<br>So, that would mean that factors NP.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:00,240 –&gt; 00:04:04,240<br>And that would not just the math.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:04,240 –&gt; 00:04:10,240<br>That would mean there would be an easy way to break the RSA-cryptal system, which is NYD use.</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:10,240 –&gt; 00:04:15,240<br>People could break codes by just by factoring in that.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:15,240 –&gt; 00:04:19,240<br>That would not be a good thing for the modern economy.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:19,240 –&gt; 00:04:27,240<br>Actually, something that attracted a lot of attention, although it’s almost 20 years ago now,</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:27,240 –&gt; 00:04:39,240<br>was a result by Peter Shore that said that there’s a device, not quite a real device called a quantum computer.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:40,240 –&gt; 00:04:48,240<br>At least one that you could imagine building, that solves factoring in a polynomial time.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:48,240 –&gt; 00:04:55,240<br>So, that raises the question of, do we still believe the extended church-turning thesis?</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:55,240 –&gt; 00:05:06,240<br>There are plenty of people that are not so sure and are working hard on trying to build devices that might have a big impact on this kind of theory.</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:07,240 –&gt; 00:05:17,240<br>Well, actually, what we create, and has created a new theory based on how difficult is it to do things with these sorts of devices.</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:17,240 –&gt; 00:05:24,240<br>Okay, but in general, suppose you have an intractable problem, what are you going to do to cope with it?</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:24,240 –&gt; 00:05:29,240<br>Well, there’s a number of things that people have done really successfully.</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:30,240 –&gt; 00:05:33,240<br>So, remember what it means to be intractable.</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:33,240 –&gt; 00:05:45,240<br>So, problems intractable, if in the sense that we don’t know a polynomial time problem that’s guaranteed to solve any instance.</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:45,240 –&gt; 00:05:53,240<br>Now, so maybe you can give up on one of the three key features of that statement.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:54,240 –&gt; 00:05:58,240<br>Maybe we don’t care if we can solve every possible instance.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:58,240 –&gt; 00:06:04,240<br>Maybe it’s only the instances that are going to arrive in the real world, arise in the real world that matter.</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:06,240 –&gt; 00:06:13,240<br>So, or maybe you can even simplify the problem, and that’s the one that you really need to solve.</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:13,240 –&gt; 00:06:22,240<br>So, for example, if you restrict satisfiability to have at most two literals per equation, you can solve in linear time.</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:22,240 –&gt; 00:06:31,240<br>Or even if you just insist that there be at most one of the literals per equation be not negated.</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:31,240 –&gt; 00:06:35,240<br>That’s called a horn set with linear time algorithm for that.</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:35,240 –&gt; 00:06:42,240<br>So, maybe your problem is you’re trying to solve too hard a problem, and you can come up with a more special case of the problem.</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:42,240 –&gt; 00:06:45,240<br>It’s actually the one you want to solve that you could solve.</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:45,240 –&gt; 00:06:49,240<br>So, it’s definitely one way to cope with interactability.</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:50,240 –&gt; 00:06:54,240<br>Another thing is optimality.</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:54,240 –&gt; 00:07:11,240<br>We’ve been talking about search problems, but this is more a statement about optimization problems, or looking for the best solution, or looking for approximate solutions.</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:11,240 –&gt; 00:07:16,240<br>Where you take away the guarantee that the solution is perfect in some way.</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:16,240 –&gt; 00:07:26,240<br>So, for example, the Travelling Salesperson Problem, people can find ways to get tours that are close to the best possible tour, but maybe not the best.</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:26,240 –&gt; 00:07:34,240<br>In this many, many other examples of this, where people are looking for good solutions without trying to guarantee that they’re optimal.</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:35,240 –&gt; 00:07:43,240<br>Maybe those solutions are very close to optimal, or at least close enough that can use the solution and move on.</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:43,240 –&gt; 00:07:48,240<br>If you understand the quality of the solution that you have, that might be good enough.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:48,240 –&gt; 00:07:53,240<br>And again, the idea of approximation algorithm where you really can prove what the quality is.</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:54,240 –&gt; 00:08:03,240<br>So, for example, there’s a max 3 set that guarantees to satisfy 7, 8s of the clauses.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:03,240 –&gt; 00:08:12,240<br>And actually, these algorithms, they’re really coming at a fine line between what’s tractable and intractable.</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:13,240 –&gt; 00:08:20,240<br>So, for example, if you want to do 7, 8s plus anything, then it means that it’s equal to mp.</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:20,240 –&gt; 00:08:23,240<br>If you can do that in polynomial time, it’s equal to mp.</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:23,240 –&gt; 00:08:27,240<br>There’s lots and lots of amazing results of this sort out there.</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:27,240 –&gt; 00:08:36,240<br>But anyway, in practice, relaxing the condition that you find the perfect solution sometimes can get a long way in practice.</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:37,240 –&gt; 00:08:41,240<br>And then the other thing is guaranteed polynomial time.</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:41,240 –&gt; 00:08:47,240<br>We were talking about worst case behavior, but there’s solutions out there.</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:47,240 –&gt; 00:08:56,240<br>For example, there’s a fat solver that was done here at Princeton that can solve 10,000 variables, fat instances.</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:56,240 –&gt; 00:09:05,240<br>Or as I mentioned, there’s solvers out there for integer linear programming that will solve huge instances of real-world problems.</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:06,240 –&gt; 00:09:12,240<br>Worst case behavior may not be observed in the real-world, might even be hard to find real-world problems.</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:12,240 –&gt; 00:09:21,240<br>This is definitely a lot of room here to find solutions that might be efficient for the class of problems that you want to solve.</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:21,240 –&gt; 00:09:30,240<br>And I just want to finish up with one of the most famous np-complete problems, which is a so-called Hamilton-Path problem.</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:31,240 –&gt; 00:09:34,240<br>And so that’s given a graph.</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:34,240 –&gt; 00:09:39,240<br>You want to find a path that visits every vertex exactly once.</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:41,240 –&gt; 00:09:44,240<br>In simple path, so I can’t reuse any edge.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:44,240 –&gt; 00:09:49,240<br>So that’s a solution to the Hamilton-Path problem for this graph.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:49,240 –&gt; 00:09:56,240<br>Another way to characterize it is the longest path problem, longer simple path problem, in a graph.</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:57,240 –&gt; 00:10:03,240<br>If you have one of the very edge exactly once, that’s not difficult.</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:03,240 –&gt; 00:10:08,240<br>It’s actually in the book, but Hamilton-Path is np-complete.</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:08,240 –&gt; 00:10:14,240<br>So that’s a natural problem that’s np-complete.</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:14,240 –&gt; 00:10:25,240<br>And actually, this is np-complete, but here’s a really simple exponential time algorithm for computing the Hamilton-Path.</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:26,240 –&gt; 00:10:40,240<br>It’s just our depth-first search algorithm where we mark nodes and recursively go through all the vertices adjacent to the current vertex.</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:40,240 –&gt; 00:10:49,240<br>And if they’re not marked, go ahead and visit them recursively, marking all the nodes that we see.</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:50,240 –&gt; 00:11:03,240<br>The only difference from the depth-first search is this thing here where when we’re done with our recursive call-on-a-node, we unmark it.</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:03,240 –&gt; 00:11:10,240<br>And what that does is make this code try all possible paths, and there’s an exponential number of paths.</p>
<p>101<br>00:11:10,240 –&gt; 00:11:17,240<br>So I find program for doing it for small graphs, but it’s going to take exponential time for a big graph.</p>
<p>102<br>00:11:17,240 –&gt; 00:11:20,240<br>But the longest path problem is np-complete.</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:20,240 –&gt; 00:11:31,240<br>We’re going to finish up with a song that was composed by a John Hopkins students one time when he was having trouble thinking about this idea.</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:47,240 –&gt; 00:12:02,240<br>There would still be papers left to write. I have a weakness. I look addicted to completeness and I keep searching for the longest path.</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:02,240 –&gt; 00:12:13,240<br>The algorithm I would like to see is a polymiumeal decree.</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:13,240 –&gt; 00:12:24,240<br>But it’s illusive. Nobody has found conclusive evidence that we can find the longest path.</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:24,240 –&gt; 00:12:35,240<br>I have been hard working for so long. I swear it’s right and he marks it wrong.</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:35,240 –&gt; 00:12:40,240<br>I’m not some how I’ll feel sorry when it’s done.</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:40,240 –&gt; 00:12:50,240<br>GPA 2.1 is more than a hope for Gary Johnson, carp and other men.</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:50,240 –&gt; 00:12:56,240<br>And women try to make it order and again.</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:56,240 –&gt; 00:13:07,240<br>I am mad. If I spend my life in grad school forever following the longest path.</p>
<p>112<br>00:13:07,240 –&gt; 00:13:30,240<br>Oh, find the longest path.</p>
<p>113<br>00:13:31,240 –&gt; 00:13:45,240<br>That’s a fine sentiment in this class on algorithms. I hope that all of you are out there or inspired to face the computational challenges of the future with the algorithms and concepts that you’ve learned in this class.</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:45,240 –&gt; 00:13:48,240<br>That’s all. Keep searching.</p>
