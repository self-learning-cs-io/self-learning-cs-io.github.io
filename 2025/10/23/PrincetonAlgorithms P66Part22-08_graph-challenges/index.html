                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,800<br>Okay, now that we’ve discussed breadth-first search and depth-first search and connected</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,800 –&gt; 00:00:16,000<br>components, three, very useful graph processing algorithm for all sorts of real applications,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,000 –&gt; 00:00:21,839<br>now we’re going to go back to the idea of the different problems that might arise when</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:21,839 –&gt; 00:00:29,240<br>doing graph processing and what are our intuition with this experience on what types of problems</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:29,239 –&gt; 00:00:33,960<br>are difficult and what types of problems are easy. It’s not that I have any real answers</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:33,960 –&gt; 00:00:39,719<br>to that, but we want to keep coming back to this issue so that we can appreciate a great</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:39,719 –&gt; 00:00:49,799<br>algorithm when we see it. So here’s a challenge or an example of a challenge. So here’s a problem</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:49,799 –&gt; 00:00:58,039<br>that comes up in plenty of applications. So you want to know if a given graph is by part-type,</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:59,240 –&gt; 00:01:08,920<br>so what by part-type means is you can divide the edges into two subsets, divide the vertices into</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:08,920 –&gt; 00:01:16,439<br>two subsets, with the property that every edge connects a vertex in one subset to a vertex and</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:16,439 –&gt; 00:01:24,280<br>another. So in this case, we can assign zero, three, and four to be red vertices and if we do that,</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:24,280 –&gt; 00:01:31,159<br>then every edge connects a red to a white vertex. That’s a by-partite graph. And we saw an example</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:31,159 –&gt; 00:01:36,519<br>of by-partite graph, the Kevin Bacon graph. We had movies and performers, two different types of</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:36,519 –&gt; 00:01:44,040<br>vertices and every edge went from movie to a performer. And in general, another application, so you</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:44,040 –&gt; 00:01:52,040<br>want to know is a graph by part-type. So by graph processing challenge, I mean, is how difficult is</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:52,040 –&gt; 00:01:58,440<br>this problem? So what do you think, based on our experience? Is this a problem that any programmer could</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:58,440 –&gt; 00:02:07,480<br>do? Or maybe you need to be a typical diligent student in this course? Or maybe it’s difficult enough</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:07,480 –&gt; 00:02:14,599<br>that you ought to pay somebody to do it? Or actually, maybe even an expert couldn’t do it and we’ll</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:14,599 –&gt; 00:02:20,120<br>talk about the precise meaning of that layer on. Or maybe we don’t even know how difficult it is.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:20,759 –&gt; 00:02:26,840<br>Or maybe we can show that it’s impossible to solve this problem. These are pretty broad categories</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:26,840 –&gt; 00:02:35,319<br>and you’d like to think that we could categorize problems in these kinds of categories. So what about</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:35,319 –&gt; 00:02:42,360<br>by-partite? We’ll do this for a bunch of problems, but what about by-partite? Well, the answer for</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:42,360 –&gt; 00:02:47,879<br>that one is that you can use the FS to get this done. I wouldn’t think that any program can do it,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:47,879 –&gt; 00:02:56,439<br>ask a friend. But with the FS, you can see in the book a pretty simple DFS-based solution</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:57,240 –&gt; 00:03:06,680<br>that to this problem that’ll tell you whether graph is by-partite, by labeling vertices in such a way</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:06,680 –&gt; 00:03:12,599<br>if it is by-partite that all the edges have the property to go from once it went vertex to another.</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:12,599 –&gt; 00:03:21,719<br>So definitely good exercise after this lecture is to try and write a program that tests whether</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:21,719 –&gt; 00:03:29,560<br>graphs by-partite or not. Here’s another application of this, by the way. That dating graph</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:30,359 –&gt; 00:03:38,039<br>for the sexual transmitted diseases. So there’s males and females. Is that one going to be by-partite?</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:38,840 –&gt; 00:03:47,159<br>I think maybe this one is, but nowadays maybe not in general. Okay, what about this one?</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:48,439 –&gt; 00:03:59,479<br>Does a graph contain a cycle or not? So in this case there’s a cycle 0 to 5 to 4 to 6 back to 0.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:59,479 –&gt; 00:04:08,759<br>And there’s other cycles, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 4, 6. Those are all cycles. So how hard is it to find a</p>
<p>33<br>00:04:08,759 –&gt; 00:04:20,839<br>cycle in a graph in these categories? Categorizations. Well, that one, it’s very simple. This one maybe</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:20,839 –&gt; 00:04:26,279<br>any program we could do, maybe. You have to have the graph representation, but you have to use DFS.</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:27,079 –&gt; 00:04:32,759<br>Well, you can figure out a way to do it without probably, but anyway, it’s really simple with</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:32,759 –&gt; 00:04:42,119<br>the FS. You need to hire an expert for finding a cycle. All right, here’s a classic graph processing</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:42,119 –&gt; 00:04:53,479<br>problem that dates back to the 18th century. So it’s this town, a Kernexberg in Prussia at the time,</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:54,439 –&gt; 00:05:01,240<br>where there’s an island. And the river kind of comes in and branches around the island and then</p>
<p>39<br>00:05:01,240 –&gt; 00:05:09,400<br>goes out in two branches. And there’s a bunch of bridges, five bridges onto the island, two from</p>
<p>40<br>00:05:09,400 –&gt; 00:05:16,040<br>the banks, and one across to this third peninsula. And then there’s two bridges crossing that way.</p>
<p>41<br>00:05:16,040 –&gt; 00:05:24,120<br>So total of seven bridges, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And Euler, whose famous</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:24,120 –&gt; 00:05:30,200<br>mathematician would go out in Sunday stroll in this place and came up with the idea,</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:31,800 –&gt; 00:05:41,640<br>could anyone find a way to go on a Sunday stroll and cross each one of these bridges exactly once?</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:42,120 –&gt; 00:05:52,039<br>So that’s often talked of as the original graph processing problem.</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:53,639 –&gt; 00:06:02,519<br>And so in terms of graphs, is there a cycle that uses every edge exactly once? Given a graph,</p>
<p>46<br>00:06:02,519 –&gt; 00:06:11,000<br>is there a cycle that uses every edge exactly once? And actually Euler proved, so to say,</p>
<p>47<br>00:06:11,079 –&gt; 00:06:17,639<br>first theorem and graph theory, if it’s connected and all the vertices have even degree,</p>
<p>48<br>00:06:18,120 –&gt; 00:06:23,399<br>you can always do it. In this case, you can’t because there’s a vertex with odd degree.</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:25,000 –&gt; 00:06:32,439<br>So that’s the answer to the existence. Is there a cycle? But suppose you wanted to find the cycle.</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:33,800 –&gt; 00:06:40,199<br>So you can go ahead and check the degree of every vertex. We looked at easy code for that to know</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:40,199 –&gt; 00:06:46,519<br>that there exists a cycle. But how about finding one that uses every edge exactly once?</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:47,800 –&gt; 00:06:53,959<br>So in this case, here’s a cycle that uses every edge exactly once. And this graph, every vertex has</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:53,959 –&gt; 00:07:05,240<br>even degree. And if you go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, you get to every edge exactly once.</p>
<p>54<br>00:07:05,879 –&gt; 00:07:13,079<br>That’s an ordinary cycle. So how about that one? Is that any programmer?</p>
<p>55<br>00:07:14,759 –&gt; 00:07:22,920<br>Already have to hire an expert or is it impossible? Well, this one, we haven’t listed as a typical</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:22,920 –&gt; 00:07:29,720<br>diligent algorithm student could do it. But it’s a bit of a challenge. It’s an interesting program.</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:29,720 –&gt; 00:07:36,440<br>And again, once you get through the bipartite graph one, you can think about this one.</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:36,440 –&gt; 00:07:43,240<br>It makes some sense what the algorithm does. But it might take you a few tries to get the code debug,</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:43,240 –&gt; 00:07:50,920<br>let’s say. Any find code for it in the book site? All right, so that’s a Larian cycle.</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:52,840 –&gt; 00:07:59,160<br>What about if you want to visit every vertex exactly once? So you don’t care about going over all</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:59,160 –&gt; 00:08:05,000<br>the edges, you just want to get to all the places. That’s called the, in this case, there is a way.</p>
<p>62<br>00:08:06,280 –&gt; 00:08:17,960<br>For this graph, 0, 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 0. So that’s a way to get to every vertex exactly once.</p>
<p>63<br>00:08:17,960 –&gt; 00:08:24,920<br>This is sometimes called the traveling salesperson problem on graphs. The traveling salesperson has to</p>
<p>64<br>00:08:24,920 –&gt; 00:08:32,360<br>get to every city and wants to just go there once without retracing steps. So how about that one?</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:34,120 –&gt; 00:08:42,120<br>The every edge is more to visit. Might seem more challenging. And actually, maybe if you have any</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:42,120 –&gt; 00:08:49,480<br>experience with this, you realize that this one is interactable. That’s called the Hamiltonian</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:49,480 –&gt; 00:08:56,279<br>cycle problem. And it’s a classical NP-complete problem. We’ll be talking about NP-complete problems</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:56,279 –&gt; 00:09:02,920<br>in the end of the course. But basically, the idea is that nobody knows an efficient solution to</p>
<p>69<br>00:09:02,920 –&gt; 00:09:10,039<br>this problem for large graphs. And it’s a frustrating situation that we’ll talk about. But you definitely</p>
<p>70<br>00:09:10,039 –&gt; 00:09:17,080<br>not going to solve it by just being a diligent algorithm of student in not even hiring an expert.</p>
<p>71<br>00:09:17,080 –&gt; 00:09:20,280<br>We’ll get it solved, no matter how much the expert charges.</p>
<p>72<br>00:09:21,720 –&gt; 00:09:28,759<br>So the intuition on finding a cycle that visits every edge once, yeah, you could do it.</p>
<p>73<br>00:09:28,759 –&gt; 00:09:35,879<br>Find a cycle that visits every vertex once, probably not. That’s the kind of challenge that we face</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:36,440 –&gt; 00:09:42,840<br>when addressing applications of graph processing. Here’s another example.</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:43,800 –&gt; 00:09:50,040<br>The problem is given two graphs, you want to know, are they identical except for the way that we</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:50,040 –&gt; 00:09:58,200<br>name the vertex? So here’s an example of these two graphs don’t look all that identical at all.</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:59,639 –&gt; 00:10:06,680<br>But if you take zero here and rename it four and one and rename it three and like that,</p>
<p>78<br>00:10:07,159 –&gt; 00:10:17,799<br>then you’ll see that they are the same graph. They represent the same connection.</p>
<p>79<br>00:10:18,839 –&gt; 00:10:25,959<br>In so many applications where maybe the vertex names are that arbitrary or you just want to know,</p>
<p>80<br>00:10:27,399 –&gt; 00:10:33,079<br>really the interest is in the structure of the connections. You might want to know it’s just the</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:33,080 –&gt; 00:10:38,200<br>way that I name the vertex makes the graph different. If I have two classes that have two different</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:38,200 –&gt; 00:10:43,080<br>kinds of interactions, is it the same interactions that’s independent of the people or scientific</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:43,080 –&gt; 00:10:49,240<br>experiment, studying property of the universe or whatever you might want to know? Is that connection</p>
<p>84<br>00:10:49,240 –&gt; 00:10:56,200<br>structure the same or not? That’s called the graph isomorphism problem. How difficult do you think</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:56,200 –&gt; 00:11:09,400<br>that one is? So you could try all possible ways of renaming the vertices, but there’s really a lot</p>
<p>86<br>00:11:09,400 –&gt; 00:11:17,560<br>of ways, in factorial ways, way too many to try for a huge graph. Is there a efficient way to do it?</p>
<p>87<br>00:11:19,000 –&gt; 00:11:25,320<br>Or is it intractable like the Hamiltonian path problem where it’s in this category that nobody</p>
<p>88<br>00:11:25,320 –&gt; 00:11:31,320<br>knows an efficient algorithm for, but there could be one. Actually for graph isomorphism,</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:31,879 –&gt; 00:11:38,040<br>that’s one that has stumped mathematicians and computer scientists for many years. Nobody knows</p>
<p>90<br>00:11:38,040 –&gt; 00:11:44,440<br>even how to classify this problem. We don’t know if it’s easy or if it’s in a class of problems that</p>
<p>91<br>00:11:45,400 –&gt; 00:11:51,160<br>we don’t know how to solve, but there could be a solution. We can’t show that it’s impossible or</p>
<p>92<br>00:11:51,240 –&gt; 00:11:57,480<br>guaranteed to be difficult. Nobody knows how to classify this problem. Again pointing out that</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:58,279 –&gt; 00:12:04,679<br>even for a relatively simple problem to state, the state of our knowledge and understanding the</p>
<p>94<br>00:12:04,679 –&gt; 00:12:13,719<br>properties of algorithms to solve such problems is incomplete for sure. So one last one,</p>
<p>95<br>00:12:14,600 –&gt; 00:12:20,600<br>here’s a graph processing challenge. So this graph when it’s laid out it’s got two edges that</p>
<p>96<br>00:12:20,600 –&gt; 00:12:25,800<br>cross between three and four and zero and five. And in general if you have a graph that you got,</p>
<p>97<br>00:12:26,519 –&gt; 00:12:32,040<br>so they say the social networking graph of a small class, you want to study that graph and look</p>
<p>98<br>00:12:32,040 –&gt; 00:12:36,519<br>at it, you want to draw it on the plane and maybe you don’t want to try to do it without having</p>
<p>99<br>00:12:36,519 –&gt; 00:12:43,560<br>edges cross. So in this case there is a way to place the vertices in the plane so that when you</p>
<p>100<br>00:12:44,439 –&gt; 00:12:52,439<br>draw the edges no two of them cross. So how difficult is that problem? You even is it possible to do or not?</p>
<p>101<br>00:12:54,119 –&gt; 00:13:02,679<br>So that’s a classic problem in graph processing that came up from the first time that people were</p>
<p>102<br>00:13:02,679 –&gt; 00:13:09,799<br>representing graphs and computers. And the answer to this one is also interesting to contemplate.</p>
<p>103<br>00:13:09,959 –&gt; 00:13:19,719<br>There’s a linear time algorithm known for this based on DFS. So that means running times could run it on huge graphs.</p>
<p>104<br>00:13:19,719 –&gt; 00:13:26,839<br>You could know whether or not you could lay it out in the plane. It was discovered by Tarjan in the 1970s.</p>
<p>105<br>00:13:26,839 –&gt; 00:13:36,439<br>And you have that name come up again in graph processing. Based on DFS, but if you really want to get this done,</p>
<p>106<br>00:13:36,440 –&gt; 00:13:44,120<br>you need to hire an expert because that is quite a complex algorithm and probably beyond what a</p>
<p>107<br>00:13:44,120 –&gt; 00:13:55,080<br>diligent algorithm student or a professor might accomplish. So that’s kind of another point on this</p>
<p>108<br>00:13:55,640 –&gt; 00:14:04,280<br>range of difficulty of graph processing problems. So there’s no question that graph processing is</p>
<p>109<br>00:14:04,279 –&gt; 00:14:12,600<br>challenging. And this introductory lecture gave us numerous useful graph processing algorithms,</p>
<p>110<br>00:14:13,240 –&gt; 00:14:19,480<br>but still leaves us with the feeling that there’s plenty more to know and we’ll cover some more in</p>
<p>111<br>00:14:19,480 –&gt; 00:14:21,000<br>later lectures.</p>
