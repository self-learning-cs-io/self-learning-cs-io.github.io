                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:10,720<br>So finally, we’re going to take a look at the implications of having negative weights in</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:10,720 –&gt; 00:00:14,880<br>directed weighted graphs.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,880 –&gt; 00:00:21,000<br>So the first thing to notice is that the easy solutions don’t work at all.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:21,000 –&gt; 00:00:25,679<br>Dijkstra’s algorithm just doesn’t work in the presence of negative weights.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:25,679 –&gt; 00:00:31,000<br>So say this weight from 2 to 3 is minus 9.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:31,000 –&gt; 00:00:38,519<br>What Dijkstra’s algorithm will do is just immediately select vertex 3 and never revisit</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:38,519 –&gt; 00:00:44,760<br>that decision saying the shortest way to get from 0 to 3 is to take this edge 0, 3, which</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:44,760 –&gt; 00:00:46,399<br>has weight 2.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,399 –&gt; 00:00:52,719<br>But the actual shortest path goes over to 4 and then over to 1 and down to 2 for a way to</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:52,719 –&gt; 00:00:55,000<br>10 and then the minus 9 makes it 1.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:55,000 –&gt; 00:01:02,159<br>So there’s a way to get from 0 to 3 with a path weight just 1 because of the minus 9.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:02,159 –&gt; 00:01:05,200<br>But Dijkstra’s algorithm won’t find that.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:05,200 –&gt; 00:01:06,560<br>So that’s not going to work.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:06,560 –&gt; 00:01:12,400<br>And you might think, well, why don’t we just make all the weights positive by adding 9 to</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:12,400 –&gt; 00:01:14,400<br>everything?</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:14,400 –&gt; 00:01:20,359<br>Well, that’s not going to work because a longer path will have 9 added to it a lot of time.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:20,359 –&gt; 00:01:26,560<br>So it’s just not any relation between shortest paths in this graph and shortest paths in</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:26,560 –&gt; 00:01:28,400<br>that graph.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,400 –&gt; 00:01:37,319<br>So those easy attempts just don’t work for dealing with negative weights in general graphs.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:37,319 –&gt; 00:01:41,879<br>So the conclusion is we need some different algorithm.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:41,879 –&gt; 00:01:45,519<br>In the topological sort one isn’t going to work because the graph might have a cycle in</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:45,519 –&gt; 00:01:46,519<br>it.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:46,519 –&gt; 00:01:48,799<br>So there’s no topological sort.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:48,799 –&gt; 00:01:51,679<br>So we need some different algorithm.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:51,679 –&gt; 00:02:01,319<br>And the main thing to think about in terms of weighted, directed graphs that might have cycles</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:01,319 –&gt; 00:02:06,359<br>is that you can have this situation called a negative cycle.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:06,359 –&gt; 00:02:08,439<br>This is a graph that all looks fine.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:08,439 –&gt; 00:02:17,840<br>It’s just got this one negative edge from 5 to 4 of weight minus 0.66.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:17,840 –&gt; 00:02:22,599<br>And these other ones are point three assemblies to 8 to this plus 0.65.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:22,599 –&gt; 00:02:35,240<br>But if you go from 5 to 4 to 7 to 5, then the distance around that is minus 0.01.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:35,240 –&gt; 00:02:41,920<br>And if we’re trying to find, say, a shortest path from 0 to 6, well, as soon as you hit this</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:41,920 –&gt; 00:02:47,680<br>cycle, if you really want the shortest path, what you could do is spin around this, well,</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:47,680 –&gt; 00:02:49,480<br>an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:49,480 –&gt; 00:02:53,159<br>You can make the path as short as you want if you hit an infinite, if you hit a negative</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:53,159 –&gt; 00:02:54,640<br>cycle.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:54,640 –&gt; 00:03:05,640<br>So negative cycles definitely can get in a way of trying to solve the shortest path problem.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:05,640 –&gt; 00:03:10,000<br>It may get somewhat ill-specified.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:10,000 –&gt; 00:03:17,520<br>So the first thing is if there’s no negative cycles, then there’s a shortest path</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:17,520 –&gt; 00:03:18,520<br>tree.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:18,520 –&gt; 00:03:21,680<br>And if there’s a shortest path tree, there’s no negative cycles.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:21,680 –&gt; 00:03:25,680<br>Assuming that you can actually get to the vertices.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:25,680 –&gt; 00:03:32,840<br>So what we’ll want is graphs that have no negative cycles.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:32,840 –&gt; 00:03:35,719<br>And then we can work with those.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:35,719 –&gt; 00:03:41,680<br>And there’s an algorithm, an old algorithm known as the Bellman Ford algorithm that does</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:41,680 –&gt; 00:03:42,879<br>the job.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:42,879 –&gt; 00:03:49,000<br>It’s only slightly more specific than the generic algorithm that we gave before.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:49,000 –&gt; 00:03:58,799<br>It just says, if you have v vertices, for just v times, all you do is go through all the</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:58,799 –&gt; 00:04:01,639<br>edges in the graph and relax each edge.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:01,639 –&gt; 00:04:08,199<br>So you make v passes through, relaxing all the edges in the graph.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:08,199 –&gt; 00:04:15,439<br>And that’s an algorithm that finds shortest paths in graphs that don’t have any negative</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:15,439 –&gt; 00:04:16,439<br>cycles.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:16,439 –&gt; 00:04:22,399<br>If there’s negative cycles, we’ll talk about what happens in a minute.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:22,399 –&gt; 00:04:27,120<br>So let’s look at that one in terms of a demo.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:27,120 –&gt; 00:04:30,800<br>So we’ll just take the list of edges in the graph.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:30,800 –&gt; 00:04:36,199<br>It could be in any order and just relax them all.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:36,199 –&gt; 00:04:44,800<br>So to start out, we set the distance to the source 0 and everybody else’s distance infinity</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:44,800 –&gt; 00:04:46,719<br>as usual.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:46,719 –&gt; 00:04:48,480<br>And then here’s the list of edges.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:48,480 –&gt; 00:04:50,759<br>So we’ll relax.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:50,759 –&gt; 00:04:56,480<br>In this case, we start out with the edges, sort of in the order that you’d get them by</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:56,480 –&gt; 00:04:57,800<br>walking through the whole graph.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:57,800 –&gt; 00:05:00,759<br>So you get all the edges associated with each vertex together.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:00,759 –&gt; 00:05:04,639<br>So we relax 0, 1, we relax 0, 4, we relax 0, 7.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:04,639 –&gt; 00:05:08,240<br>That’s kind of the way a dikester would start out.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:08,240 –&gt; 00:05:14,159<br>And then we go ahead and relax the edges that come out from 1.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:14,159 –&gt; 00:05:19,240<br>So 1, 2 takes us to 2 for the first time.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:19,240 –&gt; 00:05:22,639<br>1, 3 takes us to 3 for the first time.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:22,639 –&gt; 00:05:26,199<br>1, 7 is no help.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:26,199 –&gt; 00:05:27,759<br>So we ignore it.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:27,759 –&gt; 00:05:30,480<br>Now we relax, sorry, I went too far.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:30,480 –&gt; 00:05:33,680<br>2, 3, and 2, 6.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:33,680 –&gt; 00:05:39,839<br>And that one takes us to 6 for the first time.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:39,839 –&gt; 00:05:43,959<br>And now 3, 6, that does not give us a better way to 6.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:43,959 –&gt; 00:05:46,000<br>So we ignore it.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:46,000 –&gt; 00:05:47,480<br>Now we go to 4, 5.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:47,480 –&gt; 00:05:50,399<br>That takes us to 5 for the first time.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:50,399 –&gt; 00:05:52,079<br>4, 6.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:52,079 –&gt; 00:05:54,959<br>Well, we could get to 4 and 9 and then 20 to 6.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:54,959 –&gt; 00:05:57,120<br>So that’s no help.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:57,120 –&gt; 00:06:01,039<br>4, 5, that’s no help.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:01,039 –&gt; 00:06:03,719<br>Now we do the ones from 5, 5, 2.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:03,719 –&gt; 00:06:05,439<br>That’s going to give a better way to 2.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:05,439 –&gt; 00:06:08,039<br>So there we improve that.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:08,039 –&gt; 00:06:11,199<br>And 5, 6 is going to give a better way to 6.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:11,199 –&gt; 00:06:14,120<br>Now 7, 5, that’s no help.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:14,120 –&gt; 00:06:16,679<br>And 7, 2 is no help.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:16,679 –&gt; 00:06:19,079<br>So I’ve completed the first pass.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:19,079 –&gt; 00:06:22,399<br>And now we’re just going to go through and relax all the edges again.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:22,399 –&gt; 00:06:25,000<br>Now a lot of them are really just what we did before.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:25,000 –&gt; 00:06:26,519<br>And they’re not going to improve anything,</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:26,519 –&gt; 00:06:31,120<br>like the ones at the beginning are not going to improve anything.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:31,120 –&gt; 00:06:36,399<br>But before too long, so still no improvement.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:36,399 –&gt; 00:06:40,519<br>But here, now the second time we relax 2, 3,</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:40,519 –&gt; 00:06:46,319<br>we have, it gives us a better way to get to 3.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:46,319 –&gt; 00:06:50,319<br>And for the first pass, it didn’t help us, but second pass,</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:50,319 –&gt; 00:06:54,120<br>we relax 2, 3 to get us to 3 and 17.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:54,120 –&gt; 00:06:56,920<br>Now that’s going to change things for 3.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:56,920 –&gt; 00:07:03,159<br>If we had already been through 3, it wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:03,159 –&gt; 00:07:05,480<br>And this wouldn’t take another pass to deal with.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:05,480 –&gt; 00:07:10,120<br>But in this case, we’re going to be coming through 3 later.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:10,120 –&gt; 00:07:12,360<br>There’s another 2 to 6 gets better.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:12,360 –&gt; 00:07:18,079<br>And then 3 to 6, well, 2 to 6 beat it so it doesn’t help.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:18,079 –&gt; 00:07:24,719<br>And now I think there’s nothing else that helps in this example.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:24,719 –&gt; 00:07:27,519<br>And in fact, there’s no further changes.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:27,519 –&gt; 00:07:32,599<br>Once we have the shortest pass tree, which we know from this example,</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:32,599 –&gt; 00:07:36,159<br>because it’s similar to when we did before,</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:36,159 –&gt; 00:07:39,360<br>then there’s going to be no changes to it.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:39,360 –&gt; 00:07:43,279<br>You’re not going to find any edges that successfully relax.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:43,279 –&gt; 00:07:47,119<br>And so go through and try them all.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:47,119 –&gt; 00:07:50,039<br>And in the end, we have a shortest pass tree.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:50,039 –&gt; 00:07:53,239<br>So that’s an example of the Bellman Ford algorithm</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:53,239 –&gt; 00:07:57,479<br>on a simple sample graph.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:57,479 –&gt; 00:08:01,359<br>Here’s the visualization of the Bellman Ford algorithm</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:01,359 –&gt; 00:08:03,199<br>running on a bigger graph.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:03,199 –&gt; 00:08:09,199<br>And here’s what it looks like after four passes, 7, 10, 13.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:09,199 –&gt; 00:08:12,879<br>This graph has 100 sum vertices.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:12,879 –&gt; 00:08:17,680<br>And it finds the tree in a relatively small number of passes.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:17,680 –&gt; 00:08:22,000<br>And we’ll talk about the performance in a second.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:22,000 –&gt; 00:08:26,599<br>One thing is to be sure that the algorithm works.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:26,599 –&gt; 00:08:30,519<br>And there’s a couple of ways to prove it.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:30,519 –&gt; 00:08:36,240<br>And again, the reason the proof has to be done with care</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:36,240 –&gt; 00:08:41,279<br>is that there could be edges with negative weights,</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:41,279 –&gt; 00:08:43,279<br>but no negative cycles.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:43,279 –&gt; 00:08:47,960<br>The idea of the proof is that after you’ve done the ice pass,</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:47,960 –&gt; 00:08:53,000<br>you’ve found the shortest paths containing at most i edges.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:53,000 –&gt; 00:08:59,320<br>And we’ll leave that proof for the book.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:59,320 –&gt; 00:09:03,879<br>Now, there is a couple of ways to improve the Bellman</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:03,879 –&gt; 00:09:06,559<br>Ford algorithm in practice.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:06,559 –&gt; 00:09:10,320<br>And the most important one is that if you</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:10,320 –&gt; 00:09:14,879<br>didn’t change the distance to a vertex during one pass,</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:14,879 –&gt; 00:09:18,840<br>then you don’t have to worry about it in the next path.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:18,840 –&gt; 00:09:22,159<br>You don’t have to worry about its edges in the next path.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:22,159 –&gt; 00:09:25,559<br>And so what we do in practice is to just</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:25,559 –&gt; 00:09:30,360<br>maintain a queue of the vertices that we found shorter paths</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:30,360 –&gt; 00:09:32,440<br>to in each pass.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:32,520 –&gt; 00:09:35,840<br>We want to make sure that we keep at most one copy of each vertex</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:35,840 –&gt; 00:09:37,280<br>on the queue.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:37,280 –&gt; 00:09:39,880<br>Otherwise, you could wind up with situations</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:39,880 –&gt; 00:09:44,200<br>where the size of the queue blows up.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:44,200 –&gt; 00:09:48,400<br>But that’s easy to do with a vertex index to rate</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:48,400 –&gt; 00:09:50,920<br>and keep track of that.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:50,920 –&gt; 00:09:53,440<br>And so in the worst case, you could</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:53,440 –&gt; 00:09:57,600<br>have all the vertices on the queue and then</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:57,600 –&gt; 00:10:02,320<br>therefore all the edges relaxed in every one of the V passes.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:02,320 –&gt; 00:10:08,200<br>But in practice, not too many vertices really get relaxed.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:08,200 –&gt; 00:10:14,640<br>So this is a quick summary of the algorithms</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:14,640 –&gt; 00:10:18,360<br>that we’ve looked for for shortest paths.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:18,360 –&gt; 00:10:21,280<br>And we didn’t do the code for Bellman Ford.</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:21,280 –&gt; 00:10:22,600<br>We’ve done enough code today.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:22,600 –&gt; 00:10:24,600<br>It’s a quite simple code that you find in the book</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:24,600 –&gt; 00:10:27,280<br>or on the book site.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:27,280 –&gt; 00:10:30,120<br>So probably the simplest algorithm</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:30,120 –&gt; 00:10:32,919<br>is when there are no directed cycles.</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:32,919 –&gt; 00:10:35,120<br>And that’s when we just topologically</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:35,120 –&gt; 00:10:37,799<br>sort the vertices and then go through that list</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:37,799 –&gt; 00:10:39,879<br>and relax every edge.</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:39,879 –&gt; 00:10:42,279<br>So that’s linear time.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:42,279 –&gt; 00:10:46,480<br>Relax all the edges in the graph, and that works,</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:46,480 –&gt; 00:10:49,639<br>even if there are negative weights.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:49,639 –&gt; 00:10:52,840<br>If there’s no negative weights, but there may be cycles,</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:52,840 –&gt; 00:10:55,120<br>then dikeschers algorithm works.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:55,120 –&gt; 00:10:57,399<br>And then we looked at e-log v-alruisms</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:57,399 –&gt; 00:11:02,120<br>where slightly faster depending on what kind of heat you use.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:02,120 –&gt; 00:11:06,399<br>Bellman Ford algorithm, which works with negative weights</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:06,399 –&gt; 00:11:11,399<br>as long as there’s no negative cycles,</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:11,399 –&gt; 00:11:15,319<br>if you do the queue, you can get the in practice.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:15,319 –&gt; 00:11:18,439<br>It turns out to be linear time for the kinds of graphs</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:18,439 –&gt; 00:11:20,159<br>that arise in practice.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:20,159 –&gt; 00:11:22,439<br>Although in principle, in the worst case,</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:22,439 –&gt; 00:11:26,960<br>it could be e times v, which is much too slow.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:26,960 –&gt; 00:11:30,080<br>So directed cycles makes the problem harder.</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:30,080 –&gt; 00:11:33,320<br>You need a dikestra instead of topological sort.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:33,320 –&gt; 00:11:37,320<br>Negative weights definitely make the problem harder,</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:37,320 –&gt; 00:11:43,920<br>because you might need to get the worst case of Bellman Ford.</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:43,920 –&gt; 00:11:47,000<br>And negative cycles, in the presence of negative cycles,</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:47,000 –&gt; 00:11:49,920<br>it actually makes the problem intractable.</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:49,920 –&gt; 00:11:54,320<br>And we’ll talk about that a little bit at the end of the course.</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:54,320 –&gt; 00:11:59,400<br>One thing that you can do with the Bellman Ford algorithm</p>
<p>179<br>00:11:59,400 –&gt; 00:12:04,200<br>is to at least find out if there’s a negative cycle.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:04,200 –&gt; 00:12:08,000<br>And one practical reason to do that is maybe it</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:08,000 –&gt; 00:12:14,160<br>has something to do with something else specified in the problem.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:14,160 –&gt; 00:12:18,240<br>And so if you can detect a negative cycle and deal with it,</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:18,240 –&gt; 00:12:21,280<br>that would be useful.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:21,280 –&gt; 00:12:24,000<br>And we’ll look at another important practical reason</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:24,000 –&gt; 00:12:27,720<br>for finding negative cycles in just a second.</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:27,720 –&gt; 00:12:30,759<br>So anyway, since it’s a useful thing to do,</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:30,759 –&gt; 00:12:34,799<br>we’re going to add two methods to the API.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:34,799 –&gt; 00:12:39,080<br>And that is, does the graph have a negative cycle?</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:39,080 –&gt; 00:12:42,159<br>And then an interval, if it does have a negative cycle,</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:42,159 –&gt; 00:12:44,080<br>please give it to me.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:44,080 –&gt; 00:12:47,559<br>So for this graph, it would return true.</p>
<p>192<br>00:12:47,559 –&gt; 00:12:50,039<br>And then it would give an interval that</p>
<p>193<br>00:12:50,039 –&gt; 00:12:53,879<br>would have these three edges that give me the negative cycle.</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:53,879 –&gt; 00:13:00,000<br>So the observation or the way to find a negative cycle</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:00,000 –&gt; 00:13:04,080<br>is to realize that what will happen with Bellman Ford</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:04,080 –&gt; 00:13:06,759<br>algorithm, if there’s a negative cycle,</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:06,759 –&gt; 00:13:09,919<br>is that it’ll every pass through.</p>
<p>198<br>00:13:09,919 –&gt; 00:13:12,639<br>It’ll basically go around the cycle.</p>
<p>199<br>00:13:12,639 –&gt; 00:13:15,080<br>Well, not every pass in length of the cycle.</p>
<p>200<br>00:13:15,080 –&gt; 00:13:18,200<br>It’ll get stuck in a loop going around the cycle,</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:18,200 –&gt; 00:13:20,879<br>depending on the order of the vertices.</p>
<p>202<br>00:13:20,879 –&gt; 00:13:25,879<br>And it’ll update and just get stuck going around the cycle.</p>
<p>203<br>00:13:25,879 –&gt; 00:13:29,879<br>So by testing what happens after Bellman Ford is done,</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:29,879 –&gt; 00:13:33,240<br>even if there’s negative cycles present,</p>
<p>205<br>00:13:33,240 –&gt; 00:13:34,759<br>we can find the negative cycles.</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:34,759 –&gt; 00:13:39,600<br>And in fact, if some vertex is updated</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:39,600 –&gt; 00:13:43,559<br>in the last phase of the Bellman Ford algorithm,</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:43,559 –&gt; 00:13:45,759<br>then there’s a negative cycle.</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:45,759 –&gt; 00:13:51,799<br>And not only that, edge 2v is the last edge on that cycle.</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:51,799 –&gt; 00:13:53,439<br>That’s the way you’ve got to v.</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:53,439 –&gt; 00:13:56,000<br>And you can trace back to find the cycle.</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:56,000 –&gt; 00:13:58,679<br>So just run the Bellman Ford algorithm.</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:58,679 –&gt; 00:14:03,159<br>And if some vertex gets updated the last time through,</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:03,159 –&gt; 00:14:06,200<br>it means that there’s a negative cycle.</p>
<p>215<br>00:14:06,200 –&gt; 00:14:07,559<br>In practice, actually, you don’t have</p>
<p>216<br>00:14:07,559 –&gt; 00:14:09,600<br>to wait till the last phase.</p>
<p>217<br>00:14:09,600 –&gt; 00:14:13,639<br>You can check the dis2 entries for negative cycles more</p>
<p>218<br>00:14:13,639 –&gt; 00:14:15,080<br>frequently.</p>
<p>219<br>00:14:15,080 –&gt; 00:14:21,320<br>But anyway, it’s possible to find a negative cycle.</p>
<p>220<br>00:14:21,320 –&gt; 00:14:24,120<br>And let’s look at an application.</p>
<p>221<br>00:14:24,120 –&gt; 00:14:30,240<br>This is an application that really motivates some people</p>
<p>222<br>00:14:30,240 –&gt; 00:14:34,720<br>to understand shortest paths out of them.</p>
<p>223<br>00:14:34,720 –&gt; 00:14:38,680<br>And the idea is currency exchange.</p>
<p>224<br>00:14:38,680 –&gt; 00:14:43,640<br>And so these are typical numbers that you might see</p>
<p>225<br>00:14:43,639 –&gt; 00:14:46,159<br>in a newspaper table or nowadays in an app</p>
<p>226<br>00:14:46,159 –&gt; 00:14:50,799<br>on your mobile device that gives the exchange rates</p>
<p>227<br>00:14:50,799 –&gt; 00:14:53,720<br>for various currencies.</p>
<p>228<br>00:14:53,720 –&gt; 00:15:00,960<br>So to convert $1 to euros, use a factor of 0.741,</p>
<p>229<br>00:15:00,960 –&gt; 00:15:03,159<br>and compute euros to a rate of 10,000,</p>
<p>230<br>00:15:03,159 –&gt; 00:15:05,039<br>0.888, and so forth.</p>
<p>231<br>00:15:05,039 –&gt; 00:15:08,000<br>So this table is a table of exchange rates.</p>
<p>232<br>00:15:08,000 –&gt; 00:15:12,559<br>And the problem is there an arbitrage opportunity.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:12,559 –&gt; 00:15:14,719<br>So what is arbitrage?</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:14,719 –&gt; 00:15:21,000<br>Well, arbitrage is when just by making exchanges,</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:21,000 –&gt; 00:15:26,719<br>according to the legal rates in the table,</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:26,719 –&gt; 00:15:28,439<br>you can make money.</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:28,439 –&gt; 00:15:32,559<br>So say we had $1,000, and then these are the going rates.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:32,559 –&gt; 00:15:40,039<br>Well, we can convert that $1,000 into $741 euros.</p>
<p>239<br>00:15:40,039 –&gt; 00:15:44,399<br>So now if we take those $71 euros and convert them</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:44,399 –&gt; 00:15:53,159<br>into Canadian dollars, it works out that we get $1,012.206</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:53,159 –&gt; 00:15:54,679<br>Canadian dollars.</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:54,679 –&gt; 00:15:56,639<br>And if we take those Canadian dollars</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:56,639 –&gt; 00:15:58,759<br>and convert them back to US dollars,</p>
<p>244<br>00:15:58,759 –&gt; 00:16:02,759<br>it works out that we have $1,07.</p>
<p>245<br>00:16:02,759 –&gt; 00:16:06,599<br>Well, that’s arbitrage, and that’s interesting.</p>
<p>246<br>00:16:06,600 –&gt; 00:16:10,480<br>If we could go ahead and do that for, well, let’s say,</p>
<p>247<br>00:16:10,480 –&gt; 00:16:14,360<br>$10,000, then it would make $70 on the deal.</p>
<p>248<br>00:16:14,360 –&gt; 00:16:19,240<br>Or $100,000 would make $700,000, or maybe $1,000,000,</p>
<p>249<br>00:16:19,240 –&gt; 00:16:22,519<br>would make $7,000, or maybe $1,000,000,</p>
<p>250<br>00:16:22,519 –&gt; 00:16:25,560<br>would make $7,000,000, no reason to stop there.</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:25,560 –&gt; 00:16:29,879<br>With arbitrage opportunity, you’re making money off the system.</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:29,879 –&gt; 00:16:32,240<br>So of course, there’s intense interest</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:32,240 –&gt; 00:16:36,480<br>in looking for opportunities like this.</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:36,480 –&gt; 00:16:40,279<br>Of course, in modern financial markets,</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:40,279 –&gt; 00:16:43,560<br>there’s many more things you can trade than currencies.</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:43,560 –&gt; 00:16:46,399<br>And these tables are big and complex.</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:46,399 –&gt; 00:16:49,800<br>And the market is supposed to take care</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:49,800 –&gt; 00:16:52,120<br>of eliminating these opportunities.</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:52,120 –&gt; 00:16:55,000<br>But if you’re using a computer and you’ve</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:55,000 –&gt; 00:16:58,480<br>got a fast algorithm for finding negative cycles</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:58,480 –&gt; 00:17:01,879<br>in directed graphs, then maybe you</p>
<p>262<br>00:17:01,879 –&gt; 00:17:04,160<br>can find the opportunity and take advantage of it</p>
<p>263<br>00:17:04,160 –&gt; 00:17:06,039<br>before the market.</p>
<p>264<br>00:17:06,039 –&gt; 00:17:08,000<br>So let’s look at how it works.</p>
<p>265<br>00:17:08,000 –&gt; 00:17:13,720<br>What we do is, again, model the situation with a graph.</p>
<p>266<br>00:17:13,720 –&gt; 00:17:20,879<br>So we’re going to have a vertex for every currency.</p>
<p>267<br>00:17:20,879 –&gt; 00:17:26,480<br>And then an edge corresponding to every transaction</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:26,480 –&gt; 00:17:27,799<br>or every entry in the table.</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:27,799 –&gt; 00:17:31,240<br>So this is actually a complete directed graph.</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:31,240 –&gt; 00:17:34,720<br>And the weight is equal to the exchange rate</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:34,720 –&gt; 00:17:38,759<br>and what we’re trying to find is a directed cycle whose</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:38,759 –&gt; 00:17:43,079<br>product of edge weights is greater than 1.</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:43,079 –&gt; 00:17:47,920<br>So that doesn’t look like a shortest path problem,</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:47,920 –&gt; 00:17:49,440<br>although it’s close.</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:49,440 –&gt; 00:17:52,160<br>And actually, it’s very close to convert this</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:52,160 –&gt; 00:17:55,039<br>to a shortest path problem.</p>
<p>277<br>00:17:55,039 –&gt; 00:18:00,600<br>What we want to do is just take logs.</p>
<p>278<br>00:18:00,599 –&gt; 00:18:04,199<br>If instead of using the exchange rate,</p>
<p>279<br>00:18:04,199 –&gt; 00:18:08,439<br>we take minus the log of the exchange rate.</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:08,439 –&gt; 00:18:11,799<br>And then multiplying turns to addition.</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:11,799 –&gt; 00:18:15,639<br>We’re looking for multiplying the exchange rates.</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:15,639 –&gt; 00:18:19,079<br>That’s the same as summing the log.</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:19,079 –&gt; 00:18:21,399<br>And we took minus log.</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:21,399 –&gt; 00:18:23,639<br>It means that what we’re looking for,</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:23,639 –&gt; 00:18:26,599<br>and when we’re trying to find product bigger than 1,</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:26,599 –&gt; 00:18:29,759<br>we’re looking for a directed cycle whose sum of edge weights</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:29,759 –&gt; 00:18:31,160<br>is less than 0.</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:31,160 –&gt; 00:18:36,240<br>Find a directed cycle whose sum of edge weights is less than 0</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:36,240 –&gt; 00:18:38,920<br>in a complete die graph.</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:38,920 –&gt; 00:18:41,559<br>That’s the negative cycle detection problem.</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:41,559 –&gt; 00:18:47,799<br>And we just saw that we can do that with the Bellman Ford</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:47,799 –&gt; 00:18:49,440<br>algorithm.</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:49,440 –&gt; 00:18:52,279<br>And again, in a huge directed graph</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:52,279 –&gt; 00:18:56,920<br>in a modern trading situation, that’s</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:56,920 –&gt; 00:18:59,319<br>an extraordinarily valuable algorithm.</p>
<p>296<br>00:18:59,319 –&gt; 00:19:02,839<br>And you can believe that there are people out there</p>
<p>297<br>00:19:02,839 –&gt; 00:19:07,119<br>running these algorithms in order to detect and take advantage</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:07,119 –&gt; 00:19:09,519<br>of arbitrage opportunity.</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:09,519 –&gt; 00:19:11,559<br>And if you don’t have a fast algorithm,</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:11,559 –&gt; 00:19:13,439<br>if you’re using a slow one, it’ll</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:13,439 –&gt; 00:19:15,720<br>be gone before you can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:15,720 –&gt; 00:19:17,799<br>That’s a fine example of the value</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:17,799 –&gt; 00:19:23,279<br>of building efficient algorithms for practical problems.</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:23,279 –&gt; 00:19:25,839<br>So here’s our summary of shortest path today.</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:25,839 –&gt; 00:19:28,240<br>We’ve seen some great classic algorithms</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:28,240 –&gt; 00:19:31,720<br>that are important and extraordinarily useful.</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:31,720 –&gt; 00:19:34,440<br>First one is digstress algorithm, which</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:34,440 –&gt; 00:19:37,640<br>is a fine efficient workhorse algorithm</p>
<p>309<br>00:19:37,640 –&gt; 00:19:40,720<br>that you see used every day.</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:40,720 –&gt; 00:19:43,599<br>And it’s a graph search algorithm that</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:43,599 –&gt; 00:19:47,960<br>is similar to the depth research and breadth research</p>
<p>312<br>00:19:47,960 –&gt; 00:19:49,039<br>that we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>313<br>00:19:49,039 –&gt; 00:19:52,319<br>And we’ll see again.</p>
<p>314<br>00:19:52,319 –&gt; 00:19:55,960<br>If the graphs are have no cycles, which</p>
<p>315<br>00:19:55,960 –&gt; 00:19:59,720<br>is a situation that arises in several important applications,</p>
<p>316<br>00:19:59,720 –&gt; 00:20:01,880<br>we can do better than digstress algorithm.</p>
<p>317<br>00:20:01,880 –&gt; 00:20:03,160<br>It’s easier.</p>
<p>318<br>00:20:03,160 –&gt; 00:20:05,519<br>And also negative weights are no problem, which</p>
<p>319<br>00:20:05,519 –&gt; 00:20:10,319<br>enables us to solve scheduling problems in other examples.</p>
<p>320<br>00:20:10,319 –&gt; 00:20:13,440<br>If there’s negative weights and negative cycles,</p>
<p>321<br>00:20:13,440 –&gt; 00:20:16,440<br>we can detect negative cycles.</p>
<p>322<br>00:20:16,440 –&gt; 00:20:18,360<br>And if there aren’t any negative cycles,</p>
<p>323<br>00:20:18,360 –&gt; 00:20:21,880<br>we can find shortest paths.</p>
<p>324<br>00:20:21,880 –&gt; 00:20:24,440<br>The general problem is intractable,</p>
<p>325<br>00:20:24,440 –&gt; 00:20:26,720<br>and we’ll come back to that.</p>
<p>326<br>00:20:26,720 –&gt; 00:20:31,160<br>But the key point that I want people to remember from today’s</p>
<p>327<br>00:20:31,160 –&gt; 00:20:33,840<br>lecture is that shortest paths are first</p>
<p>328<br>00:20:33,840 –&gt; 00:20:37,799<br>real example of a general problem solving model,</p>
<p>329<br>00:20:37,799 –&gt; 00:20:41,200<br>where there’s a lot of important practical problems</p>
<p>330<br>00:20:41,200 –&gt; 00:20:45,039<br>that we can cast as shortest fast problems, number one.</p>
<p>331<br>00:20:45,039 –&gt; 00:20:49,200<br>And number two, we have fast solutions to those problems</p>
<p>332<br>00:20:49,200 –&gt; 00:20:51,840<br>with these classic algorithms that we’ve talked about today.</p>
<p>333<br>00:20:54,960 –&gt; 00:20:56,200<br>See you next time.</p>
<p>334<br>00:20:56,200 –&gt; 00:20:56,519<br>OK.</p>
