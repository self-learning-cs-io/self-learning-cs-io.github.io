                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,960<br>Key Index County is a great algorithm, but that’s not the end of the story.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,960 –&gt; 00:00:11,599<br>It’s also useful for creating a more general purpose algorithm for strings.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,599 –&gt; 00:00:15,320<br>The first one we’ll look at is called LSD Radix Sort.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:15,320 –&gt; 00:00:19,080<br>Least significant digit for string sorting.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,080 –&gt; 00:00:21,440<br>And the idea is a very simple one.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:21,440 –&gt; 00:00:27,879<br>We have strings, so we’re going to consider now a small example where strings are all</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:27,879 –&gt; 00:00:29,679<br>of the same length.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:29,679 –&gt; 00:00:37,200<br>And again, that’s often true in practical applications, the count numbers and so forth.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:37,200 –&gt; 00:00:41,480<br>Strings that use a sort of keys may all be the same length.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:41,480 –&gt; 00:00:46,879<br>And what we’re going to do is consider the character positions in the strings and move</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,879 –&gt; 00:00:48,879<br>from right to left.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:48,879 –&gt; 00:00:57,519<br>The algorithm is to just stably sort using Key Index County on the depth character.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:57,520 –&gt; 00:01:01,640<br>The key goes from the right end and decreases.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:01,640 –&gt; 00:01:10,719<br>So this is a stable sort of those 12 keys sorting on the right most character, the bees</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:10,719 –&gt; 00:01:14,520<br>go before the bees go before the bees.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:14,520 –&gt; 00:01:20,000<br>It’s crucial that the sort be stable in this application.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:20,000 –&gt; 00:01:27,400<br>And that’s why we checked with Key Index County to make sure that it was stable.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:27,400 –&gt; 00:01:31,880<br>So it’s a stable sort on the right most character.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,880 –&gt; 00:01:36,960<br>And then all we do is move from right to left and do now the second character.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:36,960 –&gt; 00:01:42,600<br>And this now is a stable sort of those same keys on the second character.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:42,600 –&gt; 00:01:48,840<br>So now the ones with A and the second character come before the one with B and so forth.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:48,840 –&gt; 00:01:51,280<br>And not only that, it’s stable.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:51,280 –&gt; 00:01:59,879<br>So their relative order is maintained, DAB, CAB, FAD, BAD and so forth.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:59,879 –&gt; 00:02:06,680<br>And then to finish this sort, now we do it on the first key.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:06,680 –&gt; 00:02:13,520<br>And the magic of LSD radix sorting is that once you do it on the first key, then the strings</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:13,520 –&gt; 00:02:15,039<br>are all sorted.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:15,039 –&gt; 00:02:21,240<br>So that’s three passes, one for each character in the string, each taking the linear time.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:21,240 –&gt; 00:02:25,560<br>We get a string sort, that’s a LSD sort.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:25,560 –&gt; 00:02:30,560<br>Now we need to prove that and it works.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:30,560 –&gt; 00:02:35,800<br>And so this is a simple proof by induction that it works.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:35,800 –&gt; 00:02:43,520<br>After we’ve done eye passes, then we can assume by induction that the strings are sorted</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:43,520 –&gt; 00:02:46,200<br>on the last eye characters.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:46,359 –&gt; 00:02:51,399<br>So we’re just showing that for two after two passes.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:51,399 –&gt; 00:02:53,239<br>It’s sorted on the last two characters.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:53,239 –&gt; 00:02:55,639<br>That’s we’re assuming by induction.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:55,639 –&gt; 00:02:59,359<br>So now what about the next character that we’re sorting?</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:59,359 –&gt; 00:03:02,399<br>Well, there’s two things that can happen.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:02,399 –&gt; 00:03:09,399<br>If two strings are different on the first key, then this key index sound is going to do the job.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:09,399 –&gt; 00:03:14,039<br>A string that starts with B is going to come before one that starts with a D and so forth.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:14,039 –&gt; 00:03:18,840<br>So if they’re different on the sort key, the key index sort puts them in order.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:18,840 –&gt; 00:03:23,719<br>If they’re the same on the sort key, then stability does the job.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:23,719 –&gt; 00:03:28,919<br>So all the ones with F stay in order because we insisted on a stable sort.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:28,919 –&gt; 00:03:34,759<br>That’s a simple proof by induction that LSD string sort, sorts fixed length strings in ascending</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:34,759 –&gt; 00:03:35,759<br>order.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:35,759 –&gt; 00:03:38,319<br>And it’s really easy to implement.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:38,319 –&gt; 00:03:44,680<br>This is a complete Java implementation of LSD string sort.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:44,680 –&gt; 00:03:50,879<br>So we’re explicitly working with Radix R equals 256.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:50,879 –&gt; 00:03:57,280<br>And where the Radix comes in, the value of the Radix comes in is that’s the size of the array</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:57,280 –&gt; 00:04:01,560<br>that we use for the counts and the accumulates.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:01,560 –&gt; 00:04:03,759<br>We need one for each character.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:03,759 –&gt; 00:04:07,199<br>For each possible character value, we’re going to index into that array.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:07,199 –&gt; 00:04:09,839<br>And that has to be that big.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:09,839 –&gt; 00:04:14,280<br>And all this is is the code for key index counting.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:14,280 –&gt; 00:04:25,599<br>And then all we do is take a variable T that goes down from this string of fixed width W.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:25,599 –&gt; 00:04:31,480<br>We start at the right most character and go down to the first character.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:31,480 –&gt; 00:04:38,960<br>And instead of dealing with our string A of I, we’re just looking at the DEEF character,</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:38,960 –&gt; 00:04:40,960<br>which is the character.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:40,960 –&gt; 00:04:46,960<br>Otherwise, just with that replacement, in that replacement, it’s the same code as we looked</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:46,960 –&gt; 00:04:48,640<br>at for key index counting.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:48,640 –&gt; 00:04:55,000<br>So it’s due key index counting on the DEEF character going down from the width, from right</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:55,000 –&gt; 00:04:56,600<br>to left.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:56,600 –&gt; 00:04:59,720<br>That’s remarkably compact code.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:59,720 –&gt; 00:05:07,080<br>And that’s going to be the method of choice for lots of situations with fixed length keys</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:07,080 –&gt; 00:05:10,680<br>as the sort key.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:10,680 –&gt; 00:05:22,000<br>And it gives us another look at the performance of sorting algorithms that gives us another</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:22,000 –&gt; 00:05:29,959<br>line in the table that we’re requiring that they be fixed length keys as ways to work</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:29,959 –&gt; 00:05:30,959<br>around that.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:30,959 –&gt; 00:05:36,240<br>And we’ll consider another algorithm that deals with that in a minute.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:36,240 –&gt; 00:05:44,879<br>But again, it’s often or typically the case that the width of the keys is not that long.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:44,879 –&gt; 00:05:46,879<br>It’s a small constant.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:46,879 –&gt; 00:05:50,839<br>And therefore, we have a linear time algorithm.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:50,839 –&gt; 00:05:58,319<br>This even works if the keys are binary numbers represented in a binary word.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:58,319 –&gt; 00:06:02,560<br>We can break them up into groups of small number of bits.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:02,560 –&gt; 00:06:09,719<br>Say, 64 bit number could be broken up into 8-8 bit characters or 4-16 bit characters.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:09,719 –&gt; 00:06:13,079<br>4-16 bit characters, W would be 4.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:13,079 –&gt; 00:06:18,919<br>And you can get a huge array of that kind of number sorted in just four passes through</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:18,919 –&gt; 00:06:19,919<br>the array.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:20,920 –&gt; 00:06:24,080<br>If they don’t have the same length, we have to do some extra work.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:24,080 –&gt; 00:06:27,080<br>It’s an interesting problem to think about.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:27,080 –&gt; 00:06:30,879<br>We’re going to look at a different method in a minute.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:30,879 –&gt; 00:06:39,400<br>So here’s the type of question that somebody might get asked for a job interview.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:39,400 –&gt; 00:06:46,759<br>Actually a web services company every day might be in the position of needing to sort a</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:46,759 –&gt; 00:06:52,399<br>million or a billion 32-bit or 64-bit integers.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:52,399 –&gt; 00:06:58,319<br>In an algorithm student interviewing might get asked what sort of method it is.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:58,319 –&gt; 00:07:10,039<br>Now, Senator, you’re here at Google and I like to think of the presidency as a job interview.</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:10,039 –&gt; 00:07:13,279<br>Now it’s hard to get a job as president.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:13,279 –&gt; 00:07:14,279<br>And you’re going to the figures.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:14,279 –&gt; 00:07:16,680<br>Now it’s also hard to get a job at Google.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:16,680 –&gt; 00:07:22,680<br>We have questions and we ask our candidates questions.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:22,680 –&gt; 00:07:26,840<br>This one is from Larry Schwimmer.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:26,840 –&gt; 00:07:28,759<br>You guys think I’m kidding?</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:28,759 –&gt; 00:07:31,280<br>It’s right here.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:31,280 –&gt; 00:07:38,199<br>What is the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers?</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:38,199 –&gt; 00:07:41,199<br>Well, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:41,199 –&gt; 00:07:43,000<br>Maybe you think you can do anything.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:43,000 –&gt; 00:07:46,639<br>I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:46,639 –&gt; 00:07:50,479<br>The wrong way to go.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:50,479 –&gt; 00:07:51,479<br>Come on.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:51,479 –&gt; 00:07:52,479<br>Who told it this?</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:52,479 –&gt; 00:07:53,479<br>Okay.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:53,479 –&gt; 00:07:57,199<br>I didn’t see computer science.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:57,199 –&gt; 00:08:00,479<br>We’ve got our spies in there.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:00,479 –&gt; 00:08:01,479<br>Okay.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:01,479 –&gt; 00:08:05,599<br>Let’s ask a different interview question.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:05,599 –&gt; 00:08:11,579<br>So the bottom line is if you want a good job, maybe you ought to know about LSD’s drink</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:11,579 –&gt; 00:08:13,579<br>sort.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:13,579 –&gt; 00:08:18,500<br>Actually, this method has been around for a really a long time.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:18,500 –&gt; 00:08:21,939<br>So we’ll start with a little bit of a story.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:21,939 –&gt; 00:08:28,180<br>So what do people do in the 19th century when they want to take a census?</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:28,180 –&gt; 00:08:35,620<br>And actually the story is that for the 1880 census, it was actually obsolete before it</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:35,620 –&gt; 00:08:38,220<br>was completed.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:38,220 –&gt; 00:08:43,779<br>It took 1,500 people seven years to manually process the data.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:43,779 –&gt; 00:08:47,540<br>So during that time, there was room for some invention.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:47,540 –&gt; 00:08:55,460<br>And a man named Herman Holleriff developed an automated machine that could help do the</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:55,460 –&gt; 00:08:58,100<br>census faster.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:58,100 –&gt; 00:09:06,220<br>So what his idea was to use punch cards to record data, the kind of data that was taken</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:06,220 –&gt; 00:09:13,899<br>in the census, and then the machine could tabulate the data by sorting one column at</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:13,899 –&gt; 00:09:15,700<br>a time.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:15,700 –&gt; 00:09:19,899<br>And we’ll look a bit at how does that in just a minute.</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:19,899 –&gt; 00:09:26,740<br>And the idea was that the result of that was that the next census finished really much</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:26,740 –&gt; 00:09:33,100<br>earlier in under budget because this machine automated much of the process.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:33,100 –&gt; 00:09:40,899<br>But it had a really profound effect on the development of computing because punch cards</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:40,899 –&gt; 00:09:47,860<br>turned out were useful not just for census, but for many other applications for accounting</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:47,860 –&gt; 00:09:51,540<br>and for many other business processes.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:51,540 –&gt; 00:09:58,860<br>And for many decades, punch cards were the primary medium that was used to store, enter</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:58,860 –&gt; 00:10:01,660<br>and process data.</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:01,659 –&gt; 00:10:07,740<br>And Holleriff’s company for building his machine later emerged with a bunch of other companies.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:07,740 –&gt; 00:10:12,500<br>And then in 1924, that company became known as IBM.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:12,500 –&gt; 00:10:21,539<br>And actually, punch cards were used up into the 70s and even the 80s in some places.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:21,539 –&gt; 00:10:28,459<br>So it’s important, let’s take a little break and talk about the role of LSD’s drink</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:28,460 –&gt; 00:10:37,019<br>or for a couple of decades, people who wrote programs were working with punch cards.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:37,019 –&gt; 00:10:45,940<br>And of course, as a university, if you want to write a program, you wrote it by putting</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:45,940 –&gt; 00:10:49,420<br>one line on each punch card.</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:49,420 –&gt; 00:10:53,060<br>And your program, therefore, was a deck, a long deck of punch cards.</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:53,060 –&gt; 00:10:57,180<br>You had a thousand line program, you had a thousand punch cards.</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:57,179 –&gt; 00:11:02,979<br>They came in boxes that held 2000 and people would carry around these boxes of punch cards</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:02,979 –&gt; 00:11:05,539<br>that were their programs.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:05,539 –&gt; 00:11:10,139<br>To enter the program, there was a thing called a card punch which had a keyboard, kind</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:10,139 –&gt; 00:11:12,099<br>of like a typewriter.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:12,099 –&gt; 00:11:15,699<br>But all it did, you could see the cards that it actually punch holes in the cards with</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:15,699 –&gt; 00:11:17,339<br>what you typed.</p>
<p>142<br>00:11:17,339 –&gt; 00:11:23,500<br>Now there was a huge, so then your program was punched cards and there was a machine called</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:23,580 –&gt; 00:11:30,220<br>a card reader which would take the cards in and convert those punches back into binary</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:30,220 –&gt; 00:11:35,740<br>and characters that again could be processed on the computer.</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:35,740 –&gt; 00:11:39,860<br>And then you get your results printed out on paper and a line printer.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:39,860 –&gt; 00:11:45,460<br>So for many, many years, people programmed by making decks of punch cards, handing them</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:45,460 –&gt; 00:11:50,899<br>to an operator or put them on a card reader and then waiting for the printed output to</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:50,899 –&gt; 00:11:51,899<br>come out.</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:51,899 –&gt; 00:11:58,899<br>And then you had to go through the cards and find the first line and then find the second</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:58,899 –&gt; 00:11:59,899<br>line.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:59,899 –&gt; 00:12:06,899<br>Well, people figured out a workaround for this really almost right from the beginning.</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:06,899 –&gt; 00:12:11,899<br>So the first line was a lot of the things that were going to be printed out on paper.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:11,899 –&gt; 00:12:16,899<br>So you had to go through the cards and find the first line and then find the second line.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:16,899 –&gt; 00:12:21,779<br>Well, people figured out a workaround for this really almost right from the beginning</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:21,779 –&gt; 00:12:26,699<br>because this is clearly an intolerable situation.</p>
<p>156<br>00:12:26,699 –&gt; 00:12:34,340<br>And along with in the same room with the card punch, there was a thing called a card</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:34,340 –&gt; 00:12:36,139<br>sorter.</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:36,139 –&gt; 00:12:39,379<br>And the card punch did one of the thing automatically.</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:39,379 –&gt; 00:12:45,299<br>Every time you punched a card, it would go to the last six columns of the card and it</p>
<p>160<br>00:12:45,299 –&gt; 00:12:48,539<br>would put in a number.</p>
<p>161<br>00:12:48,539 –&gt; 00:12:49,779<br>Actually they skipped by ten.</p>
<p>162<br>00:12:49,779 –&gt; 00:12:54,179<br>So it would be the first card, it would be card ten, then twenty, thirty.</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:54,179 –&gt; 00:12:57,620<br>And your cards would be numbered up to six digits.</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:57,620 –&gt; 00:13:00,620<br>So you could have thousands of cards sequentially.</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:00,620 –&gt; 00:13:05,219<br>So when you typed in your program, you get the cards numbered in order.</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:05,219 –&gt; 00:13:09,500<br>If you wanted to add a few lines to a program, you had room to add a couple of numbers and</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:09,500 –&gt; 00:13:11,299<br>repunch the numbers.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:11,299 –&gt; 00:13:17,339<br>But the whole point was that all the time when you’re holding on to a card deck, the cards</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:17,339 –&gt; 00:13:21,779<br>are in order by number on the right hand column.</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:21,779 –&gt; 00:13:25,139<br>And if you dropped it, all you needed to do was sort it.</p>
<p>171<br>00:13:25,139 –&gt; 00:13:29,419<br>Or if the machine operator dropped it and it was not viewed as a big deal for your cards</p>
<p>172<br>00:13:29,419 –&gt; 00:13:35,139<br>to get out of order because there was this machine that could sort cards.</p>
<p>173<br>00:13:35,139 –&gt; 00:13:39,460<br>And the way that it worked was LSD radix sort.</p>
<p>174<br>00:13:39,460 –&gt; 00:13:45,899<br>LSD string sort on those characters that are the numbers that keep the card in order.</p>
<p>175<br>00:13:45,899 –&gt; 00:13:48,500<br>It would start on the right column.</p>
<p>176<br>00:13:48,500 –&gt; 00:13:52,500<br>And there was a physical thing, it sat to what column it was going to sort on.</p>
<p>177<br>00:13:52,500 –&gt; 00:13:58,340<br>You put the deck in and it would distribute the ones with zero in the first bin or ones</p>
<p>178<br>00:13:58,340 –&gt; 00:14:01,379<br>with one in the second bin all the way up.</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:01,379 –&gt; 00:14:04,500<br>And all the cards would start with zero would come in.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:04,500 –&gt; 00:14:05,500<br>And it was stable.</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:05,500 –&gt; 00:14:09,259<br>Whatever order the cards were in, that’s the order that appear in the pile.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:09,259 –&gt; 00:14:12,700<br>And then you pick them up and you’d have a new deck and it would be all sorted on the</p>
<p>183<br>00:14:12,700 –&gt; 00:14:14,340<br>right most column.</p>
<p>184<br>00:14:14,340 –&gt; 00:14:20,899<br>Then you move over one position from right to left and run the cards through again.</p>
<p>185<br>00:14:20,899 –&gt; 00:14:26,220<br>So with running the cards through the cards order six times, you could get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>186<br>00:14:26,220 –&gt; 00:14:32,940<br>So every programmer knew LSD radix sort for decades.</p>
<p>187<br>00:14:32,940 –&gt; 00:14:38,379<br>It was not something that was difficult to teach 40 years ago.</p>
<p>188<br>00:14:38,379 –&gt; 00:14:45,980<br>And this equipment is now all pretty much gone, but LSD radix sort is still a good algorithm</p>
<p>189<br>00:14:45,980 –&gt; 00:14:49,740<br>to know.</p>
<p>190<br>00:14:49,740 –&gt; 00:14:50,740<br>Not related.</p>
<p>191<br>00:14:50,740 –&gt; 00:14:54,060<br>It is something else that was going on with those initials at that time.</p>
<p>192<br>00:14:56,220 –&gt; 00:15:00,220<br>So, you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:00,220 –&gt; 00:15:02,220<br>So, you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:02,220 –&gt; 00:15:04,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>195<br>00:15:04,220 –&gt; 00:15:06,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>196<br>00:15:06,220 –&gt; 00:15:08,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>197<br>00:15:08,220 –&gt; 00:15:10,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>198<br>00:15:10,220 –&gt; 00:15:12,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>199<br>00:15:12,220 –&gt; 00:15:14,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>200<br>00:15:14,220 –&gt; 00:15:16,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>201<br>00:15:16,220 –&gt; 00:15:18,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>202<br>00:15:18,220 –&gt; 00:15:20,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>203<br>00:15:20,220 –&gt; 00:15:22,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
<p>204<br>00:15:22,220 –&gt; 00:15:24,220<br>And then you can get your deck sorted.</p>
