                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:19,400<br>look streets</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:19,400 –&gt; 00:00:28,900<br>can</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:28,899 –&gt; 00:00:31,539<br>I’m over here at the county jail of the city.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:31,539 –&gt; 00:00:33,780<br>DJ Merchor’s in there.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:33,780 –&gt; 00:00:34,719<br>It’s not looking good.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:34,719 –&gt; 00:00:37,259<br>Whatever, he’s behind on child support.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,259 –&gt; 00:00:38,739<br>So let’s just go through this.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:38,739 –&gt; 00:00:41,420<br>So again, the purpose of this lecture is we want to discuss</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,420 –&gt; 00:00:44,179<br>the logistics for the course now,</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:44,179 –&gt; 00:00:47,420<br>you know, online rather than in person.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:47,420 –&gt; 00:00:49,659<br>So that way in the first day of class next week,</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:49,659 –&gt; 00:00:51,579<br>we can just jump into all the database stuff right away.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:51,579 –&gt; 00:00:53,460<br>All right, so let’s go through this.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:53,460 –&gt; 00:00:57,379<br>The reason again, why am I down here at the county jail?</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:57,380 –&gt; 00:00:59,420<br>Well, because the database is, right?</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:59,420 –&gt; 00:01:01,620<br>And this is what this course is really all about.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:01,620 –&gt; 00:01:04,700<br>So that we’re focusing on the most important things</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:04,700 –&gt; 00:01:05,780<br>in your life.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:05,780 –&gt; 00:01:07,659<br>And yes, sometimes bad things happen.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:07,659 –&gt; 00:01:11,060<br>So for me, the two most important things in my life</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:11,060 –&gt; 00:01:13,900<br>are my wife and my biological daughter, first,</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:13,900 –&gt; 00:01:14,939<br>they’re number one.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:14,939 –&gt; 00:01:16,900<br>And then after that, it’s just databases.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:16,900 –&gt; 00:01:20,060<br>That’s really what you should be getting out of this course.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:20,060 –&gt; 00:01:22,140<br>The databases is all consuming.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:22,140 –&gt; 00:01:24,219<br>Everything in the world is a database problem.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:24,219 –&gt; 00:01:26,180<br>And you’ll have, I think, a better appreciation</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:26,180 –&gt; 00:01:27,180<br>for this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:27,180 –&gt; 00:01:31,180<br>So again, we’ll cover this in class next week.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:31,180 –&gt; 00:01:33,660<br>But another thing important thing to point out</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:33,660 –&gt; 00:01:36,780<br>for this lecture this semester is,</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:36,780 –&gt; 00:01:39,260<br>we’re gracially sponsored by SingleStore.</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:39,260 –&gt; 00:01:41,220<br>And they’re helping out with, of course, development.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:41,220 –&gt; 00:01:45,780<br>So SingleStore is a in-memory column store distributed</p>
<p>35<br>00:01:45,780 –&gt; 00:01:47,820<br>database system that supports just in time</p>
<p>36<br>00:01:47,820 –&gt; 00:01:49,140<br>great compilation.</p>
<p>37<br>00:01:49,140 –&gt; 00:01:51,660<br>Now, if none of that makes sense for you right now,</p>
<p>38<br>00:01:51,660 –&gt; 00:01:53,980<br>that’s fine because we’ll cover all these things</p>
<p>39<br>00:01:53,980 –&gt; 00:01:55,219<br>throughout this semester.</p>
<p>40<br>00:01:55,219 –&gt; 00:01:57,980<br>And so we’re grateful for them helping us out.</p>
<p>41<br>00:01:57,980 –&gt; 00:02:02,140<br>And they’ll become giving a guest lecture at the end</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:02,140 –&gt; 00:02:03,659<br>of the semester.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:03,659 –&gt; 00:02:06,260<br>So more than that as we go along.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:06,260 –&gt; 00:02:08,259<br>All right, so today’s lecture real quickly.</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:08,259 –&gt; 00:02:09,900<br>We’re going to first obviously discuss the wait list.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:09,900 –&gt; 00:02:11,659<br>That’s what a lot of you guys care about.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:11,659 –&gt; 00:02:14,180<br>Then we’ll talk about the rules we have for the lectures.</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:14,180 –&gt; 00:02:15,620<br>And then we’ll go through all the course logistics</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:15,620 –&gt; 00:02:18,860<br>including homeworks and projects.</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:18,860 –&gt; 00:02:22,539<br>So the first thing to obviously deal with is the wait list.</p>
<p>51<br>00:02:22,539 –&gt; 00:02:24,060<br>It should probably aware of your senior student.</p>
<p>52<br>00:02:24,060 –&gt; 00:02:26,500<br>The wait list is quite long.</p>
<p>53<br>00:02:26,500 –&gt; 00:02:29,460<br>And there’s more people that can take one take the course</p>
<p>54<br>00:02:29,460 –&gt; 00:02:30,620<br>than we can actually accommodate.</p>
<p>55<br>00:02:30,620 –&gt; 00:02:34,420<br>So at this point, the CS department has taken over</p>
<p>56<br>00:02:34,420 –&gt; 00:02:39,819<br>the wait list from us because they need</p>
<p>57<br>00:02:39,819 –&gt; 00:02:41,500<br>to make sure that certain students need to graduate.</p>
<p>58<br>00:02:41,500 –&gt; 00:02:44,620<br>And you know, hands, take us to source of black,</p>
<p>59<br>00:02:44,620 –&gt; 00:02:45,460<br>there’s all that.</p>
<p>60<br>00:02:45,460 –&gt; 00:02:46,420<br>They all get threatened.</p>
<p>61<br>00:02:46,420 –&gt; 00:02:50,420<br>So the professors have no control over the wait list.</p>
<p>62<br>00:02:50,420 –&gt; 00:02:52,300<br>So if you send this email, there’s not much.</p>
<p>63<br>00:02:52,300 –&gt; 00:02:54,939<br>There’s nothing we can do.</p>
<p>64<br>00:02:54,939 –&gt; 00:02:57,020<br>And the admins will then move students off the wait list.</p>
<p>65<br>00:02:57,020 –&gt; 00:02:58,939<br>But they’re not going to always go in the order</p>
<p>66<br>00:02:58,939 –&gt; 00:03:02,300<br>that you’re ranked in the wait list.</p>
<p>67<br>00:03:02,300 –&gt; 00:03:03,420<br>Because there’s multiple sections.</p>
<p>68<br>00:03:03,420 –&gt; 00:03:05,300<br>There’s undergrad, there’s master students.</p>
<p>69<br>00:03:05,300 –&gt; 00:03:08,540<br>So just because you’re some low-known on the wait list,</p>
<p>70<br>00:03:08,540 –&gt; 00:03:11,380<br>there’s no guarantee that we can get you in the semester.</p>
<p>71<br>00:03:11,380 –&gt; 00:03:14,740<br>The good news is that since we hired Jim Neshpatel</p>
<p>72<br>00:03:14,740 –&gt; 00:03:17,820<br>as the new data professor with me here at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>73<br>00:03:17,820 –&gt; 00:03:22,260<br>we can now offer $15, $14, $14, $5, $625 every semester.</p>
<p>74<br>00:03:22,419 –&gt; 00:03:25,739<br>So we’ll be offered again in spring 2024</p>
<p>75<br>00:03:25,739 –&gt; 00:03:28,259<br>in addition to this semester.</p>
<p>76<br>00:03:28,259 –&gt; 00:03:32,179<br>All right, so the other thing, when we have the in class lectures,</p>
<p>77<br>00:03:32,179 –&gt; 00:03:35,939<br>it’s really important that I wanted to be interactive.</p>
<p>78<br>00:03:35,939 –&gt; 00:03:39,259<br>We don’t just just stand up there for an hour</p>
<p>79<br>00:03:39,259 –&gt; 00:03:41,899<br>and paddle on about databases.</p>
<p>80<br>00:03:41,899 –&gt; 00:03:42,579<br>It’s always helpful.</p>
<p>81<br>00:03:42,579 –&gt; 00:03:45,219<br>It’s always fun when students ask questions.</p>
<p>82<br>00:03:45,219 –&gt; 00:03:47,299<br>And these questions could be either because we’re</p>
<p>83<br>00:03:47,299 –&gt; 00:03:49,899<br>talking too fast and you want us to slow down.</p>
<p>84<br>00:03:49,899 –&gt; 00:03:51,340<br>I get excited when I talk about databases.</p>
<p>85<br>00:03:51,340 –&gt; 00:03:55,180<br>So I’m going to do that, please tell me to shut up and slow down.</p>
<p>86<br>00:03:55,180 –&gt; 00:03:57,180<br>And certainly if you don’t understand what we’re talking about,</p>
<p>87<br>00:03:57,180 –&gt; 00:04:00,060<br>it’s good to interrupt to ask clarifying questions.</p>
<p>88<br>00:04:00,060 –&gt; 00:04:02,420<br>Because maybe there’s something about in the slides</p>
<p>89<br>00:04:02,420 –&gt; 00:04:04,340<br>or the discussion that makes sense.</p>
<p>90<br>00:04:04,340 –&gt; 00:04:07,580<br>And oftentimes, too, if you have questions,</p>
<p>91<br>00:04:07,580 –&gt; 00:04:10,740<br>other people have same questions as well.</p>
<p>92<br>00:04:10,740 –&gt; 00:04:12,420<br>So please, anytime during the lectures,</p>
<p>93<br>00:04:12,420 –&gt; 00:04:13,980<br>please interrupt us with anything that’s</p>
<p>94<br>00:04:13,980 –&gt; 00:04:15,219<br>dated which we later.</p>
<p>95<br>00:04:15,219 –&gt; 00:04:17,740<br>What we don’t know when we’re going to interrupt it about is whether</p>
<p>96<br>00:04:17,740 –&gt; 00:04:20,980<br>or not you can go to the bathroom because you</p>
<p>97<br>00:04:20,980 –&gt; 00:04:23,140<br>don’t have to answer missions.</p>
<p>98<br>00:04:23,140 –&gt; 00:04:25,180<br>We also don’t want to be interrupted about blockchains.</p>
<p>99<br>00:04:25,180 –&gt; 00:04:27,460<br>Watching for databases or stupid.</p>
<p>100<br>00:04:27,460 –&gt; 00:04:28,300<br>We’re not going to cover this.</p>
<p>101<br>00:04:28,300 –&gt; 00:04:29,420<br>There’s no need to cover that.</p>
<p>102<br>00:04:29,420 –&gt; 00:04:32,379<br>I assure someone is about this.</p>
<p>103<br>00:04:32,379 –&gt; 00:04:35,819<br>We’re not covering these things.</p>
<p>104<br>00:04:35,819 –&gt; 00:04:38,740<br>So now, because I want you to interrupt us</p>
<p>105<br>00:04:38,740 –&gt; 00:04:40,420<br>while we’re giving lectures, that means</p>
<p>106<br>00:04:40,420 –&gt; 00:04:45,900<br>that we don’t want you to come at the end of the lecture</p>
<p>107<br>00:04:45,900 –&gt; 00:04:48,300<br>and say, oh, what about slide three?</p>
<p>108<br>00:04:48,300 –&gt; 00:04:50,060<br>I did this to make sense of this over.</p>
<p>109<br>00:04:50,540 –&gt; 00:04:52,500<br>In the past, we’ve always finished lectures.</p>
<p>110<br>00:04:52,500 –&gt; 00:04:54,660<br>And then there’s several students lined up</p>
<p>111<br>00:04:54,660 –&gt; 00:04:57,379<br>asking the same question over again.</p>
<p>112<br>00:04:57,379 –&gt; 00:04:58,660<br>And again, this is what I’m saying.</p>
<p>113<br>00:04:58,660 –&gt; 00:05:01,019<br>If you interrupt us as we’re going along,</p>
<p>114<br>00:05:01,019 –&gt; 00:05:02,860<br>it’ll help everyone at the same time.</p>
<p>115<br>00:05:02,860 –&gt; 00:05:04,699<br>So please, we’re not, we want to answer any questions</p>
<p>116<br>00:05:04,699 –&gt; 00:05:07,939<br>about the slides immediately after class.</p>
<p>117<br>00:05:07,939 –&gt; 00:05:10,220<br>All right, so what is this course?</p>
<p>118<br>00:05:10,220 –&gt; 00:05:15,860<br>So 15405, 645 is a course about the designed implementation</p>
<p>119<br>00:05:15,860 –&gt; 00:05:19,259<br>of the database minlist systems.</p>
<p>120<br>00:05:19,259 –&gt; 00:05:21,459<br>Now, which is, we’re going to discuss relational database</p>
<p>121<br>00:05:21,459 –&gt; 00:05:22,579<br>minlist systems.</p>
<p>122<br>00:05:22,579 –&gt; 00:05:24,779<br>And we’ll cover that in the next lecture.</p>
<p>123<br>00:05:24,779 –&gt; 00:05:26,259<br>But it’s really about how you should</p>
<p>124<br>00:05:26,259 –&gt; 00:05:27,860<br>have to build these systems.</p>
<p>125<br>00:05:27,860 –&gt; 00:05:30,539<br>So this is in the course about how to use one.</p>
<p>126<br>00:05:30,539 –&gt; 00:05:32,539<br>This is, of course, how to build an application that</p>
<p>127<br>00:05:32,539 –&gt; 00:05:35,099<br>uses an O or M to make calls to the database or whatever.</p>
<p>128<br>00:05:35,099 –&gt; 00:05:38,779<br>It is really how you build the internals of these systems.</p>
<p>129<br>00:05:38,779 –&gt; 00:05:40,019<br>And the reason why this is the one</p>
<p>130<br>00:05:40,019 –&gt; 00:05:43,379<br>to focus on this topic, because no matter where you go</p>
<p>131<br>00:05:43,379 –&gt; 00:05:45,860<br>in your life, in any aspect of computer science,</p>
<p>132<br>00:05:45,860 –&gt; 00:05:47,819<br>or even outside of your computer science,</p>
<p>133<br>00:05:47,819 –&gt; 00:05:49,639<br>there’ll be times where you’re always</p>
<p>134<br>00:05:49,639 –&gt; 00:05:51,219<br>going to be interacting with the database.</p>
<p>135<br>00:05:51,219 –&gt; 00:05:52,899<br>And therefore, you need to know how these things are actually</p>
<p>136<br>00:05:52,899 –&gt; 00:05:53,420<br>running.</p>
<p>137<br>00:05:53,420 –&gt; 00:05:56,019<br>So the end of you don’t go off and go to single store</p>
<p>138<br>00:05:56,019 –&gt; 00:05:58,219<br>and work on actually the internal database system.</p>
<p>139<br>00:05:58,219 –&gt; 00:05:59,740<br>You need to know what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>140<br>00:05:59,740 –&gt; 00:06:02,459<br>They help you understand why the system is</p>
<p>141<br>00:06:02,459 –&gt; 00:06:03,819<br>behaving a certain way.</p>
<p>142<br>00:06:03,819 –&gt; 00:06:06,060<br>And I actually have people email me and tell me</p>
<p>143<br>00:06:06,060 –&gt; 00:06:09,539<br>that a lot of the concepts of the database</p>
<p>144<br>00:06:09,539 –&gt; 00:06:12,819<br>are applicable to other things, like Q and systems and whatnot.</p>
<p>145<br>00:06:12,819 –&gt; 00:06:15,379<br>So the things we’re covering this semester,</p>
<p>146<br>00:06:15,379 –&gt; 00:06:17,300<br>I think will be super useful throughout your time</p>
<p>147<br>00:06:18,300 –&gt; 00:06:18,540<br>here.</p>
<p>148<br>00:06:18,540 –&gt; 00:06:21,660<br>So if you want to learn about how to use a database system,</p>
<p>149<br>00:06:21,660 –&gt; 00:06:25,460<br>or how to administer a database system, like being a TBA,</p>
<p>150<br>00:06:25,460 –&gt; 00:06:27,259<br>there’s a couple courses in Heinz College</p>
<p>151<br>00:06:27,259 –&gt; 00:06:29,060<br>that you should probably take instead.</p>
<p>152<br>00:06:29,060 –&gt; 00:06:30,740<br>This is really about, like, if you want</p>
<p>153<br>00:06:30,740 –&gt; 00:06:35,540<br>to get your hands dirty on the internals of these systems.</p>
<p>154<br>00:06:35,540 –&gt; 00:06:36,980<br>So the logistics of the course, everything</p>
<p>155<br>00:06:36,980 –&gt; 00:06:38,580<br>will be on the course website.</p>
<p>156<br>00:06:38,580 –&gt; 00:06:41,819<br>We’ll be publishing that very soon.</p>
<p>157<br>00:06:41,819 –&gt; 00:06:43,740<br>The all the discussions and announcements</p>
<p>158<br>00:06:43,740 –&gt; 00:06:46,460<br>throughout the semester will be done through Piazza.</p>
<p>159<br>00:06:46,459 –&gt; 00:06:48,259<br>All the homeworks and projects will be submitted</p>
<p>160<br>00:06:48,259 –&gt; 00:06:49,180<br>through Grayscope.</p>
<p>161<br>00:06:49,180 –&gt; 00:06:51,699<br>Everything will be automated.</p>
<p>162<br>00:06:51,699 –&gt; 00:06:55,299<br>And then the final grades will be posted on campus.</p>
<p>163<br>00:06:55,299 –&gt; 00:06:59,019<br>And again, if you’re enrolled in the course,</p>
<p>164<br>00:06:59,019 –&gt; 00:07:01,139<br>officially, you should have access to all these things</p>
<p>165<br>00:07:01,139 –&gt; 00:07:03,779<br>right now.</p>
<p>166<br>00:07:03,779 –&gt; 00:07:05,699<br>So if you’re a non-SIMU student, because I</p>
<p>167<br>00:07:05,699 –&gt; 00:07:07,939<br>know a lot of you outside SIMU, like the watch lectures</p>
<p>168<br>00:07:07,939 –&gt; 00:07:09,500<br>and the computer projects, well, we</p>
<p>169<br>00:07:09,500 –&gt; 00:07:13,620<br>have a separate Grayscope account set up for the course that</p>
<p>170<br>00:07:13,620 –&gt; 00:07:17,019<br>will mirror what the official SIMU one does.</p>
<p>171<br>00:07:17,019 –&gt; 00:07:20,420<br>And you can use this code to log in and get access to it.</p>
<p>172<br>00:07:20,420 –&gt; 00:07:21,980<br>And this will allow you to submit your projects</p>
<p>173<br>00:07:21,980 –&gt; 00:07:25,980<br>and get graded the same way that the SIMU students do.</p>
<p>174<br>00:07:25,980 –&gt; 00:07:27,540<br>So again, if you’re a non-SIMU student,</p>
<p>175<br>00:07:27,540 –&gt; 00:07:29,980<br>we ask you, since we’re providing this,</p>
<p>176<br>00:07:29,980 –&gt; 00:07:32,899<br>we have our materials for you for your charge,</p>
<p>177<br>00:07:32,899 –&gt; 00:07:35,579<br>please don’t post your solutions on GitHub.</p>
<p>178<br>00:07:35,579 –&gt; 00:07:38,259<br>Please don’t email myself, jignash, or the TAs, for help.</p>
<p>179<br>00:07:38,259 –&gt; 00:07:39,899<br>Just because we have so many people</p>
<p>180<br>00:07:39,899 –&gt; 00:07:40,860<br>who need help here at SIMU.</p>
<p>181<br>00:07:40,860 –&gt; 00:07:42,579<br>We can’t help everyone.</p>
<p>182<br>00:07:42,579 –&gt; 00:07:44,779<br>There is a Discord channel that actually is not one</p>
<p>183<br>00:07:44,779 –&gt; 00:07:45,819<br>by SIMU.</p>
<p>184<br>00:07:45,819 –&gt; 00:07:48,539<br>Somebody outside of it has sent this up.</p>
<p>185<br>00:07:48,539 –&gt; 00:07:51,300<br>This sort of becomes an effective location</p>
<p>186<br>00:07:51,300 –&gt; 00:07:53,620<br>for discussing various tasks before.</p>
<p>187<br>00:07:53,620 –&gt; 00:07:55,819<br>So I encourage you to sign up and check that out.</p>
<p>188<br>00:07:55,819 –&gt; 00:08:00,099<br>And again, in exchange for helping us out with this,</p>
<p>189<br>00:08:00,099 –&gt; 00:08:04,259<br>or us helping everyone with these materials,</p>
<p>190<br>00:08:04,259 –&gt; 00:08:07,299<br>I ask you, if someone please finish my Wikipedia article,</p>
<p>191<br>00:08:07,299 –&gt; 00:08:08,659<br>I think it’s been flagged.</p>
<p>192<br>00:08:08,659 –&gt; 00:08:12,379<br>Because there was some stuff that was sort of true,</p>
<p>193<br>00:08:12,379 –&gt; 00:08:13,379<br>not true, or whatever.</p>
<p>194<br>00:08:13,379 –&gt; 00:08:16,180<br>Someone could fix that for me, that would be great.</p>
<p>195<br>00:08:16,180 –&gt; 00:08:18,060<br>All right, there’s a text book for the course.</p>
<p>196<br>00:08:18,060 –&gt; 00:08:20,459<br>Database systems concepts from Silver Shots,</p>
<p>197<br>00:08:20,459 –&gt; 00:08:22,740<br>forth and Shundershin.</p>
<p>198<br>00:08:22,740 –&gt; 00:08:25,060<br>It’s not required, like there’s no homeworks</p>
<p>199<br>00:08:25,060 –&gt; 00:08:26,219<br>that are based on it.</p>
<p>200<br>00:08:26,219 –&gt; 00:08:27,980<br>But if you want supplemental reading beyond,</p>
<p>201<br>00:08:27,980 –&gt; 00:08:31,740<br>we discuss in the class, there’ll be a reading</p>
<p>202<br>00:08:31,740 –&gt; 00:08:35,340<br>so you can go and dive deeper into the data various topics.</p>
<p>203<br>00:08:35,340 –&gt; 00:08:36,860<br>Now, there are going to be some things</p>
<p>204<br>00:08:36,860 –&gt; 00:08:40,019<br>that we discuss that the text book doesn’t cover.</p>
<p>205<br>00:08:40,019 –&gt; 00:08:42,819<br>I don’t think it covers as well as they should.</p>
<p>206<br>00:08:42,819 –&gt; 00:08:44,899<br>And that would provide lecture notes</p>
<p>207<br>00:08:44,899 –&gt; 00:08:48,579<br>as PDF files that are available there.</p>
<p>208<br>00:08:48,579 –&gt; 00:08:52,259<br>Whether you need to buy this text book or not,</p>
<p>209<br>00:08:52,259 –&gt; 00:08:52,860<br>it’s up to you.</p>
<p>210<br>00:08:52,860 –&gt; 00:08:54,779<br>And it depends on how deep you can really</p>
<p>211<br>00:08:54,779 –&gt; 00:08:58,539<br>get my go into this material.</p>
<p>212<br>00:08:58,539 –&gt; 00:09:00,659<br>So the grading rubric for this semester</p>
<p>213<br>00:09:00,659 –&gt; 00:09:01,620<br>is going to be following.</p>
<p>214<br>00:09:01,620 –&gt; 00:09:03,019<br>So this is a project heavy course.</p>
<p>215<br>00:09:03,019 –&gt; 00:09:06,100<br>The 45% of the grade will be based on your projects.</p>
<p>216<br>00:09:06,100 –&gt; 00:09:08,579<br>And I’ll discuss what these are in a second.</p>
<p>217<br>00:09:08,580 –&gt; 00:09:12,900<br>It’ll be five homework assignments, four projects,</p>
<p>218<br>00:09:12,900 –&gt; 00:09:15,139<br>then a midterm exam and a final exam.</p>
<p>219<br>00:09:15,139 –&gt; 00:09:17,940<br>We’ll see the breakdown here.</p>
<p>220<br>00:09:17,940 –&gt; 00:09:20,580<br>So all the homeworks will be based on the material</p>
<p>221<br>00:09:20,580 –&gt; 00:09:24,700<br>we cover in class and in the assigned readings.</p>
<p>222<br>00:09:24,700 –&gt; 00:09:28,259<br>The first homework assignment will be a SQL project</p>
<p>223<br>00:09:28,259 –&gt; 00:09:30,940<br>where you have to write some SQL queries</p>
<p>224<br>00:09:30,940 –&gt; 00:09:34,820<br>on against a data set and put a city correct answer.</p>
<p>225<br>00:09:34,820 –&gt; 00:09:35,740<br>Everything after that, please.</p>
<p>226<br>00:09:35,740 –&gt; 00:09:37,460<br>For homeworks will be all kinds of paper,</p>
<p>227<br>00:09:37,460 –&gt; 00:09:39,460<br>just those in grades and grades and the order</p>
<p>228<br>00:09:39,460 –&gt; 00:09:40,500<br>we did there.</p>
<p>229<br>00:09:40,500 –&gt; 00:09:41,980<br>Again, it’s CMU.</p>
<p>230<br>00:09:41,980 –&gt; 00:09:42,780<br>Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>231<br>00:09:42,780 –&gt; 00:09:45,259<br>All your homeworks should be done individually.</p>
<p>232<br>00:09:45,259 –&gt; 00:09:48,980<br>And you shouldn’t copy it up each other.</p>
<p>233<br>00:09:48,980 –&gt; 00:09:50,820<br>All the projects will be based on a system</p>
<p>234<br>00:09:50,820 –&gt; 00:09:52,660<br>with the invoiting for several years now here,</p>
<p>235<br>00:09:52,660 –&gt; 00:09:55,700<br>here, kind of you know, called bus term.</p>
<p>236<br>00:09:55,700 –&gt; 00:09:59,500<br>We discussed in class what the name bus term actually means,</p>
<p>237<br>00:09:59,500 –&gt; 00:10:01,740<br>or what it came from.</p>
<p>238<br>00:10:01,740 –&gt; 00:10:07,379<br>But the idea here is that it’s a educational</p>
<p>239<br>00:10:07,379 –&gt; 00:10:10,659<br>test bed database system where you will do all your projects</p>
<p>240<br>00:10:10,659 –&gt; 00:10:13,580<br>on and you’ll see over time as you add more features</p>
<p>241<br>00:10:13,580 –&gt; 00:10:15,419<br>to the database system, you’ll get about understanding</p>
<p>242<br>00:10:15,419 –&gt; 00:10:20,419<br>how all the various layers fit together and run queries</p>
<p>243<br>00:10:20,419 –&gt; 00:10:22,179<br>and you can see results based on the stuff</p>
<p>244<br>00:10:22,179 –&gt; 00:10:23,460<br>that you actually build.</p>
<p>245<br>00:10:23,460 –&gt; 00:10:25,820<br>So it’s very important that you don’t fall behind</p>
<p>246<br>00:10:25,820 –&gt; 00:10:27,220<br>on the projects because every project</p>
<p>247<br>00:10:27,220 –&gt; 00:10:28,620<br>is going to build on the previous one.</p>
<p>248<br>00:10:28,620 –&gt; 00:10:30,779<br>Like in Project One, you’re going to build a buffal cool manager.</p>
<p>249<br>00:10:30,779 –&gt; 00:10:33,220<br>And then in Project Two, you’re going to build an index</p>
<p>250<br>00:10:33,220 –&gt; 00:10:36,899<br>that gets pages or gets memory.</p>
<p>251<br>00:10:36,899 –&gt; 00:10:38,500<br>So it’s really important that you stay in track,</p>
<p>252<br>00:10:38,500 –&gt; 00:10:41,379<br>start projects early and don’t fall behind.</p>
<p>253<br>00:10:42,379 –&gt; 00:10:44,500<br>Plus top is written in C++, specifically,</p>
<p>254<br>00:10:44,500 –&gt; 00:10:47,419<br>I think it’s, what, C++ 20 now?</p>
<p>255<br>00:10:47,419 –&gt; 00:10:48,699<br>Not 17.</p>
<p>256<br>00:10:48,699 –&gt; 00:10:49,860<br>We don’t use all the advanced features</p>
<p>257<br>00:10:49,860 –&gt; 00:10:51,259<br>in the new version, so C++,</p>
<p>258<br>00:10:51,259 –&gt; 00:10:55,299<br>but the assumptions that you’re coming into this class</p>
<p>259<br>00:10:55,299 –&gt; 00:10:57,779<br>with the familiarity and being comfortable</p>
<p>260<br>00:10:57,779 –&gt; 00:10:59,939<br>with writing and debugging C++.</p>
<p>261<br>00:11:01,220 –&gt; 00:11:02,860<br>And so I think there’s a post on piata,</p>
<p>262<br>00:11:02,860 –&gt; 00:11:06,139<br>whether 2, 13, 5, 13 was enough for this.</p>
<p>263<br>00:11:06,139 –&gt; 00:11:07,139<br>The answer is no.</p>
<p>264<br>00:11:08,580 –&gt; 00:11:10,620<br>Some of the things you’ll be able to pick up</p>
<p>265<br>00:11:10,620 –&gt; 00:11:12,460<br>as you go along, but it’s,</p>
<p>266<br>00:11:12,460 –&gt; 00:11:14,699<br>I think it’s a little more advanced than 2, 13.</p>
<p>267<br>00:11:15,860 –&gt; 00:11:17,379<br>All color layers, it late days in a second,</p>
<p>268<br>00:11:17,379 –&gt; 00:11:20,259<br>but there’s, all the late days are only allowed projects</p>
<p>269<br>00:11:20,259 –&gt; 00:11:22,580<br>on the homeworks and you’re given four late days</p>
<p>270<br>00:11:22,580 –&gt; 00:11:25,299<br>that you can use for any project as you go along.</p>
<p>271<br>00:11:25,299 –&gt; 00:11:26,500<br>And as we release each project,</p>
<p>272<br>00:11:26,500 –&gt; 00:11:27,939<br>there’ll be an online presentation</p>
<p>273<br>00:11:27,939 –&gt; 00:11:29,860<br>that will hold where you can come in as,</p>
<p>274<br>00:11:29,860 –&gt; 00:11:31,740<br>like week after the project released,</p>
<p>275<br>00:11:31,740 –&gt; 00:11:32,980<br>after you’ve sort of looked at the code,</p>
<p>276<br>00:11:32,980 –&gt; 00:11:35,100<br>you can come in as questions about it with the TAs</p>
<p>277<br>00:11:35,420 –&gt; 00:11:36,899<br>or that make that available for every.</p>
<p>278<br>00:11:38,500 –&gt; 00:11:42,060<br>So as a post in the email and I’ll post with you else again,</p>
<p>279<br>00:11:42,060 –&gt; 00:11:44,379<br>there is a project zero that require all students</p>
<p>280<br>00:11:44,379 –&gt; 00:11:46,700<br>that want to take the class, have to complete.</p>
<p>281<br>00:11:46,700 –&gt; 00:11:49,060<br>And this is really a safety mechanism</p>
<p>282<br>00:11:49,060 –&gt; 00:11:51,420<br>to make sure that in your coming to this class,</p>
<p>283<br>00:11:51,420 –&gt; 00:11:53,100<br>prepare to write C++ code.</p>
<p>284<br>00:11:54,259 –&gt; 00:11:56,740<br>And so it’s not graded in that it doesn’t affect</p>
<p>285<br>00:11:56,740 –&gt; 00:11:58,259<br>your final score in the class,</p>
<p>286<br>00:11:58,259 –&gt; 00:12:00,060<br>which you’re required to complete it</p>
<p>287<br>00:12:00,060 –&gt; 00:12:02,259<br>because again, we don’t want people</p>
<p>288<br>00:12:02,259 –&gt; 00:12:04,580<br>who don’t know C++ to think they’re gonna pick it up</p>
<p>289<br>00:12:04,580 –&gt; 00:12:06,259<br>as they go along throughout the semester.</p>
<p>290<br>00:12:06,259 –&gt; 00:12:08,259<br>And then realize, oh, I have them though,</p>
<p>291<br>00:12:08,259 –&gt; 00:12:10,980<br>C++ learns C++ and learn Davis at the same time.</p>
<p>292<br>00:12:10,980 –&gt; 00:12:13,060<br>It does not end well.</p>
<p>293<br>00:12:13,060 –&gt; 00:12:15,139<br>Trust me, I’ve done this enough that we realize</p>
<p>294<br>00:12:15,139 –&gt; 00:12:17,340<br>that this is really helped you</p>
<p>295<br>00:12:17,340 –&gt; 00:12:19,340<br>rather than make you like on your own.</p>
<p>296<br>00:12:19,340 –&gt; 00:12:22,300<br>So if you do not complete this project zero</p>
<p>297<br>00:12:22,300 –&gt; 00:12:24,900<br>by the deadline of September 10th,</p>
<p>298<br>00:12:24,900 –&gt; 00:12:26,820<br>we’re gonna ask you to withdraw from this.</p>
<p>299<br>00:12:26,820 –&gt; 00:12:29,060<br>And zero exceptionally made,</p>
<p>300<br>00:12:29,060 –&gt; 00:12:30,580<br>I don’t care that your brother took five,</p>
<p>301<br>00:12:30,580 –&gt; 00:12:33,420<br>13, 10 years ago and you saw what he did that kind of,</p>
<p>302<br>00:12:33,740 –&gt; 00:12:36,259<br>it doesn’t matter, you have to complete this.</p>
<p>303<br>00:12:36,259 –&gt; 00:12:37,459<br>It shouldn’t take that much time, right?</p>
<p>304<br>00:12:37,459 –&gt; 00:12:38,939<br>It’s a pretty basic try.</p>
<p>305<br>00:12:40,899 –&gt; 00:12:44,819<br>For office hours, myself, Jignesh and the TAs</p>
<p>306<br>00:12:44,819 –&gt; 00:12:48,219<br>will hold office hours at various times during the week,</p>
<p>307<br>00:12:48,219 –&gt; 00:12:50,979<br>but he Monday and Friday.</p>
<p>308<br>00:12:50,979 –&gt; 00:12:54,259<br>And then there won’t be any office hours regularly</p>
<p>309<br>00:12:54,259 –&gt; 00:12:58,539<br>on Saturdays, but the day before every project is due,</p>
<p>310<br>00:12:58,539 –&gt; 00:13:00,539<br>we’ll have a sort of power session.</p>
<p>311<br>00:13:00,539 –&gt; 00:13:04,139<br>We have multiple TAs for multiple hours available</p>
<p>312<br>00:13:04,139 –&gt; 00:13:06,419<br>for a beautiful thing as questions were.</p>
<p>313<br>00:13:06,419 –&gt; 00:13:08,740<br>But this means that there won’t be any office hours</p>
<p>314<br>00:13:08,740 –&gt; 00:13:11,699<br>on the Sunday when projects are due</p>
<p>315<br>00:13:11,699 –&gt; 00:13:14,419<br>because we don’t want people to wait to the last minute</p>
<p>316<br>00:13:14,419 –&gt; 00:13:16,339<br>to try to work on something.</p>
<p>317<br>00:13:16,339 –&gt; 00:13:19,699<br>And then hoping the TAs will help them figure things out.</p>
<p>318<br>00:13:19,699 –&gt; 00:13:21,539<br>Again, this is a forcing function to make sure</p>
<p>319<br>00:13:21,539 –&gt; 00:13:24,579<br>that you are making progress,</p>
<p>320<br>00:13:24,579 –&gt; 00:13:27,059<br>start working projects as soon as they’re released.</p>
<p>321<br>00:13:27,059 –&gt; 00:13:28,579<br>So you’re not trying to do as much as you can</p>
<p>322<br>00:13:28,579 –&gt; 00:13:29,779<br>at the last day.</p>
<p>323<br>00:13:29,779 –&gt; 00:13:32,860<br>Because it’s consistent programming is not easy.</p>
<p>324<br>00:13:32,860 –&gt; 00:13:33,980<br>And you will make mistakes</p>
<p>325<br>00:13:33,980 –&gt; 00:13:37,620<br>and you’ll have a takes time to figure things out.</p>
<p>326<br>00:13:37,620 –&gt; 00:13:40,179<br>For this semester, we’re actually offering the course</p>
<p>327<br>00:13:40,179 –&gt; 00:13:42,299<br>to see MewQ students.</p>
<p>328<br>00:13:42,299 –&gt; 00:13:44,259<br>So welcome to thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>329<br>00:13:44,259 –&gt; 00:13:45,819<br>And I realize there’s a time zone difference.</p>
<p>330<br>00:13:45,819 –&gt; 00:13:51,819<br>And so we will have a regularly scheduled office hour</p>
<p>331<br>00:13:52,379 –&gt; 00:13:55,939<br>that lines up with your working hours</p>
<p>332<br>00:13:55,939 –&gt; 00:13:57,980<br>with a different TA each week.</p>
<p>333<br>00:13:57,980 –&gt; 00:13:58,899<br>I’m not on the system.</p>
<p>334<br>00:13:58,899 –&gt; 00:14:03,580<br>Piazza will be in that way at least talk to somebody</p>
<p>335<br>00:14:03,580 –&gt; 00:14:04,700<br>if you need to.</p>
<p>336<br>00:14:04,700 –&gt; 00:14:05,659<br>And then if you need to talk to your gym</p>
<p>337<br>00:14:05,659 –&gt; 00:14:07,100<br>and ask them myself, you know, we’ll</p>
<p>338<br>00:14:07,100 –&gt; 00:14:10,700<br>post how to schedule calls with us at different times.</p>
<p>339<br>00:14:10,700 –&gt; 00:14:12,300<br>As it has needed.</p>
<p>340<br>00:14:12,300 –&gt; 00:14:14,580<br>Again, so this morning session or whenever</p>
<p>341<br>00:14:14,580 –&gt; 00:14:16,379<br>it will be for the CMEQ students,</p>
<p>342<br>00:14:16,379 –&gt; 00:14:19,019<br>we ask the regular, the Pittsburgh senior students</p>
<p>343<br>00:14:19,019 –&gt; 00:14:20,420<br>not to do that.</p>
<p>344<br>00:14:20,420 –&gt; 00:14:21,980<br>And by all means, please always have questions.</p>
<p>345<br>00:14:21,980 –&gt; 00:14:23,180<br>Post some Piazza right away.</p>
<p>346<br>00:14:23,180 –&gt; 00:14:25,060<br>Because you’ll get an answer sooner.</p>
<p>347<br>00:14:25,060 –&gt; 00:14:27,180<br>Hopefully that way.</p>
<p>348<br>00:14:27,419 –&gt; 00:14:31,500<br>I guess I’m in the late policy for homework.</p>
<p>349<br>00:14:31,500 –&gt; 00:14:32,979<br>It’s used 10 points every hour.</p>
<p>350<br>00:14:32,979 –&gt; 00:14:35,379<br>It’s my first late.</p>
<p>351<br>00:14:35,379 –&gt; 00:14:37,099<br>And then the four ideas I’m talking about</p>
<p>352<br>00:14:37,099 –&gt; 00:14:42,379<br>will be only the applicable to four projects.</p>
<p>353<br>00:14:42,379 –&gt; 00:14:45,819<br>If there’s a medical emergency, there’s some kind of,</p>
<p>354<br>00:14:45,819 –&gt; 00:14:49,739<br>it’s a extreme circumstances, the term that the senior</p>
<p>355<br>00:14:49,739 –&gt; 00:14:50,419<br>like to use.</p>
<p>356<br>00:14:50,419 –&gt; 00:14:53,659<br>So medical emergency, family emergency,</p>
<p>357<br>00:14:53,659 –&gt; 00:14:55,939<br>if you need an extension, please</p>
<p>358<br>00:14:55,940 –&gt; 00:14:57,740<br>email instructors as soon as possible.</p>
<p>359<br>00:14:57,740 –&gt; 00:14:59,220<br>And that way we can make sure we make</p>
<p>360<br>00:14:59,220 –&gt; 00:15:00,740<br>the appropriate accommodations.</p>
<p>361<br>00:15:00,740 –&gt; 00:15:03,260<br>If necessary, you may need to go through the medical thing,</p>
<p>362<br>00:15:03,260 –&gt; 00:15:06,100<br>go through the health health of us.</p>
<p>363<br>00:15:06,100 –&gt; 00:15:09,700<br>But email us sooner rather later.</p>
<p>364<br>00:15:09,700 –&gt; 00:15:12,700<br>Like, can’t be friends with us, but like,</p>
<p>365<br>00:15:12,700 –&gt; 00:15:14,820<br>it’s not good to be a district ever 10 years, 10 weeks.</p>
<p>366<br>00:15:14,820 –&gt; 00:15:16,700<br>And then you come back to any extent.</p>
<p>367<br>00:15:16,700 –&gt; 00:15:17,980<br>If soon as you know something’s up,</p>
<p>368<br>00:15:17,980 –&gt; 00:15:19,460<br>we’re here to help just a lot of us now.</p>
<p>369<br>00:15:19,460 –&gt; 00:15:21,460<br>OK?</p>
<p>370<br>00:15:21,460 –&gt; 00:15:23,460<br>Hi, I got to say this every year.</p>
<p>371<br>00:15:23,460 –&gt; 00:15:24,660<br>Do not plagiarize.</p>
<p>372<br>00:15:24,659 –&gt; 00:15:26,419<br>So all the homeworks, all the projects</p>
<p>373<br>00:15:26,419 –&gt; 00:15:27,860<br>must be your own original work.</p>
<p>374<br>00:15:27,860 –&gt; 00:15:29,100<br>Do not group assignments.</p>
<p>375<br>00:15:29,100 –&gt; 00:15:31,459<br>You can discuss your projects with students.</p>
<p>376<br>00:15:31,459 –&gt; 00:15:32,779<br>That’s fine.</p>
<p>377<br>00:15:32,779 –&gt; 00:15:34,699<br>You can be in flesh out ideas on the whiteboard,</p>
<p>378<br>00:15:34,699 –&gt; 00:15:37,059<br>but do not copy source bit from other people.</p>
<p>379<br>00:15:37,059 –&gt; 00:15:40,100<br>Do not copy source bit from GIPO.</p>
<p>380<br>00:15:40,100 –&gt; 00:15:43,500<br>So again, because we make this public to people outside CMU,</p>
<p>381<br>00:15:43,500 –&gt; 00:15:45,459<br>there’s a lot of implementations from previous semesters</p>
<p>382<br>00:15:45,459 –&gt; 00:15:48,699<br>from that are available in GIPO.</p>
<p>383<br>00:15:48,699 –&gt; 00:15:52,860<br>ChatTPT might be able to even do earlier projects.</p>
<p>384<br>00:15:52,860 –&gt; 00:15:56,539<br>Do not copy them because we use Grayscope now.</p>
<p>385<br>00:15:56,539 –&gt; 00:15:59,259<br>Grayscope has a play-diner checker.</p>
<p>386<br>00:15:59,259 –&gt; 00:16:00,899<br>And basically what we do is we find all the GIPO</p>
<p>387<br>00:16:00,899 –&gt; 00:16:02,899<br>implementations from non-seemew students,</p>
<p>388<br>00:16:02,899 –&gt; 00:16:04,220<br>load them up into GIPO.</p>
<p>389<br>00:16:04,220 –&gt; 00:16:06,460<br>I’m talking to Grayscope, I’d say students,</p>
<p>390<br>00:16:06,460 –&gt; 00:16:08,940<br>and then see whether you match against them.</p>
<p>391<br>00:16:08,940 –&gt; 00:16:11,220<br>Do not copy your source code from other students.</p>
<p>392<br>00:16:11,220 –&gt; 00:16:13,139<br>Do not copy source code from GIPO.</p>
<p>393<br>00:16:13,139 –&gt; 00:16:14,019<br>I’d say else too.</p>
<p>394<br>00:16:14,019 –&gt; 00:16:15,860<br>The GIPO source code is usually pretty crappy.</p>
<p>395<br>00:16:15,860 –&gt; 00:16:16,940<br>We’ve done experiments before.</p>
<p>396<br>00:16:16,940 –&gt; 00:16:18,500<br>She has done this.</p>
<p>397<br>00:16:18,500 –&gt; 00:16:20,539<br>The CMU students crush the non-seemew students.</p>
<p>398<br>00:16:20,539 –&gt; 00:16:21,939<br>So it’s actually in your best interest</p>
<p>399<br>00:16:21,939 –&gt; 00:16:24,059<br>not to copy them.</p>
<p>400<br>00:16:24,059 –&gt; 00:16:26,819<br>Again, there won’t be any exceptions.</p>
<p>401<br>00:16:26,819 –&gt; 00:16:28,019<br>Oh, I didn’t know.</p>
<p>402<br>00:16:28,019 –&gt; 00:16:31,379<br>The fact that this is recorded lecture,</p>
<p>403<br>00:16:31,379 –&gt; 00:16:33,059<br>if we have to report you to Warner Hall,</p>
<p>404<br>00:16:33,059 –&gt; 00:16:35,059<br>we point to this timestamp in the lecture</p>
<p>405<br>00:16:35,059 –&gt; 00:16:37,139<br>and say where I’m warning you, not to plagiarize.</p>
<p>406<br>00:16:37,139 –&gt; 00:16:38,659<br>And then you plagiarize.</p>
<p>407<br>00:16:38,659 –&gt; 00:16:40,860<br>And now you’re screwed.</p>
<p>408<br>00:16:40,860 –&gt; 00:16:43,620<br>If there’s something you want to do that seems kind of like</p>
<p>409<br>00:16:43,620 –&gt; 00:16:45,659<br>Graysome, and you don’t want this OK,</p>
<p>410<br>00:16:45,659 –&gt; 00:16:48,620<br>like using ChatTPT or something like that, right?</p>
<p>411<br>00:16:48,620 –&gt; 00:16:52,980<br>Please email myself in Jignesh, not the TAs to see whether,</p>
<p>412<br>00:16:52,980 –&gt; 00:16:55,980<br>you know, see whether we want to discuss it.</p>
<p>413<br>00:16:55,980 –&gt; 00:16:57,820<br>And then the link there will be for CMU’s policy</p>
<p>414<br>00:16:57,820 –&gt; 00:16:59,100<br>or an academic integrity.</p>
<p>415<br>00:16:59,100 –&gt; 00:17:01,340<br>Again, we take this very seriously.</p>
<p>416<br>00:17:01,340 –&gt; 00:17:04,059<br>Don’t f*** around.</p>
<p>417<br>00:17:04,059 –&gt; 00:17:06,660<br>All right, one last thing is that if you love</p>
<p>418<br>00:17:06,660 –&gt; 00:17:07,700<br>database as much as I do, and you’re</p>
<p>419<br>00:17:07,700 –&gt; 00:17:09,859<br>going to go beyond the course material,</p>
<p>420<br>00:17:09,859 –&gt; 00:17:11,579<br>we are offering a seminar series this semester.</p>
<p>421<br>00:17:11,579 –&gt; 00:17:13,619<br>It’s entirely optional.</p>
<p>422<br>00:17:13,619 –&gt; 00:17:16,019<br>Where every Monday starting in September,</p>
<p>423<br>00:17:16,019 –&gt; 00:17:19,019<br>we’re having a different outside speaker</p>
<p>424<br>00:17:19,019 –&gt; 00:17:22,420<br>come give a talk about the various databases</p>
<p>425<br>00:17:22,420 –&gt; 00:17:23,819<br>you have company or project.</p>
<p>426<br>00:17:23,819 –&gt; 00:17:25,420<br>So this semester, the theme is machine learning</p>
<p>427<br>00:17:25,420 –&gt; 00:17:28,500<br>for databases and database machine learning.</p>
<p>428<br>00:17:28,500 –&gt; 00:17:32,700<br>And so we have people that are building a lot of these hot</p>
<p>429<br>00:17:32,700 –&gt; 00:17:33,900<br>thing now, these vector databases,</p>
<p>430<br>00:17:33,900 –&gt; 00:17:35,500<br>with all this stuff next class.</p>
<p>431<br>00:17:35,500 –&gt; 00:17:38,460<br>But we’re having them talk about their systems</p>
<p>432<br>00:17:38,460 –&gt; 00:17:41,819<br>how to export LLM, like stuff inside of data systems.</p>
<p>433<br>00:17:41,819 –&gt; 00:17:43,779<br>And then we’ll have people talk about how</p>
<p>434<br>00:17:43,779 –&gt; 00:17:46,460<br>they’re using machine learning to optimize database systems.</p>
<p>435<br>00:17:46,460 –&gt; 00:17:49,819<br>I use them to make the system actually with the faster.</p>
<p>436<br>00:17:49,819 –&gt; 00:17:51,259<br>So again, this is optional.</p>
<p>437<br>00:17:51,259 –&gt; 00:17:53,059<br>Everything will be on Zoom.</p>
<p>438<br>00:17:53,059 –&gt; 00:17:57,619<br>Monday’s at 4.30, and then we’ll post it on YouTube afterwards.</p>
<p>439<br>00:17:57,619 –&gt; 00:17:59,460<br>Again, in this one, you don’t have to be a CMU’s tonight.</p>
<p>440<br>00:17:59,460 –&gt; 00:18:02,259<br>Or you can join it if you’re a digitalist here</p>
<p>441<br>00:18:02,259 –&gt; 00:18:04,700<br>at the full schedule.</p>
<p>442<br>00:18:04,700 –&gt; 00:18:06,899<br>All right, so that’s it for the LLM.</p>
<p>443<br>00:18:06,899 –&gt; 00:18:11,779<br>I got to figure out what we’re going to do about Mushu.</p>
<p>444<br>00:18:11,779 –&gt; 00:18:12,500<br>He’s not getting it now.</p>
<p>445<br>00:18:12,500 –&gt; 00:18:16,500<br>And then we’ll begin right out of the gate, not taking any logistics.</p>
<p>446<br>00:18:16,500 –&gt; 00:18:17,500<br>But of course, we’ll just immediately</p>
<p>447<br>00:18:17,500 –&gt; 00:18:20,259<br>talk about the relational model and the databases.</p>
<p>448<br>00:18:20,259 –&gt; 00:18:21,420<br>All right, guys.</p>
<p>449<br>00:18:21,420 –&gt; 00:18:22,420<br>See you next week.</p>
