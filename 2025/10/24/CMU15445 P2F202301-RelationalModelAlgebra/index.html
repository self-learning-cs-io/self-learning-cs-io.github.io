                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:29,679<br>I’m clearly violating fire code here.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:29,679 –&gt; 00:00:36,679<br>I guess you can kind of maybe sit up there at front or you sit on the floor.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:36,679 –&gt; 00:00:45,679<br>So, let’s talk about, first of all, we have a DJ again, a round of applause from DJ2PL.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:45,679 –&gt; 00:00:50,679<br>You’re the fiercest DJ that’s not in jail right now. Do you want to do a quick preview?</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:50,679 –&gt; 00:00:58,679<br>What would you do to everyone?</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:58,679 –&gt; 00:01:03,679<br>The other big announcement too is that for the first time we now have two faculty teaching</p>
<p>7<br>00:01:03,679 –&gt; 00:01:08,680<br>at this place, J. Ganesh Patel, who’s in the front row here.</p>
<p>8<br>00:01:08,680 –&gt; 00:01:18,680<br>Wisconsin. We’re happy that he’s here, so it will be help me throughout the sector.</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:18,680 –&gt; 00:01:25,680<br>Okay, so I’ll get going. I’ll post it on Piazza. There’s another course lecture we’ve already talked about.</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:25,680 –&gt; 00:01:32,680<br>I get moved to that in jail. So, of the course. So, we’re not going to go over like a bunch of those things all over again.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:32,680 –&gt; 00:01:36,680<br>I just want to cover some things that if you might have missed that are important to understand throughout this lecture,</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:36,680 –&gt; 00:01:39,680<br>and then we’ll jump right into the material.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:39,680 –&gt; 00:01:45,680<br>All right, so the first thing we have a course sponsor, single store, cloud-based database system</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:45,680 –&gt; 00:01:50,680<br>that supports hybrid workloads, transactions, analytics. As I said in the first lecture,</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:50,680 –&gt; 00:01:55,680<br>it is a in-memory column store that uses skip list with just in time query.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:55,680 –&gt; 00:02:00,680<br>It’s distributed, shared nothing. If no, that means anything to you right now. That’s fine.</p>
<p>17<br>00:02:00,680 –&gt; 00:02:04,680<br>Things. Basically coming at the end of the semester to give a guest lecture,</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:04,680 –&gt; 00:02:11,680<br>a guest for a long time, they really called men’s sequel, and then they changed the name to single store.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:12,680 –&gt; 00:02:18,680<br>It’s a state-of-the-art database system that’s going to incorporate a lot of the stuff that we’ll discuss throughout the semester.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:18,680 –&gt; 00:02:23,680<br>The crowd is huge. Obviously, not everyone is going to be here. They’re trying to get the wait list.</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:23,680 –&gt; 00:02:29,680<br>The bad news is because the wait list is so huge, the department took it away from us, and we have no controller.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:29,680 –&gt; 00:02:35,680<br>They’re trying to figure out who needs a graduate, who needs to get the system elective and all that stuff.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:36,680 –&gt; 00:02:41,680<br>If you comment and ask us, hey, can I get off the wait list? The bad news is that we don’t control it anymore.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:41,680 –&gt; 00:02:46,680<br>The good news is because we have Gignesh now that we’ll be teaching this class every semester.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:46,680 –&gt; 00:02:50,680<br>If you can’t get in this semester, you’ll be able to get it next semester.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:50,680 –&gt; 00:02:56,680<br>The admins will move people off the wait list as people drop and at the end of the class become available.</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:06,680 –&gt; 00:03:14,680<br>Different departments, different departments, different departments, different things I found out since I came faculty.</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:14,680 –&gt; 00:03:20,680<br>The bad news is that if you’re not enrolled now, you’re unlikely to be in the spring.</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:20,680 –&gt; 00:03:28,680<br>For all the important announcements, everything will be in Piazza, Project Zero, which we talked about last in the first lecture.</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:29,680 –&gt; 00:03:32,680<br>That’s now available on Gradescope and on the website.</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:32,680 –&gt; 00:03:37,680<br>The final grades we show through Canvas and everything will be submitted through Gradescope.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:37,680 –&gt; 00:03:44,680<br>Again, because people watch these lectures that aren’t at CMU, they’re going to be outside of our university.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:44,680 –&gt; 00:03:51,680<br>If you want to test your projects, same way that CMU students are, there’s a separate Gradescope account.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:51,680 –&gt; 00:03:55,680<br>You can go to using that code there and you can start them and test things out.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:56,680 –&gt; 00:03:58,680<br>I’ll release those projects as…</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:01,680 –&gt; 00:04:02,680<br>In exchange for…</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:04,680 –&gt; 00:04:05,680<br>…for people to watch this.</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:06,680 –&gt; 00:04:09,680<br>In exchange, to make this all available to you, we need to…</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:11,680 –&gt; 00:04:12,680<br>I don’t think you have one yet, do you?</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:12,680 –&gt; 00:04:16,680<br>My God, band, because first thing I get about there is sort of true.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:16,680 –&gt; 00:04:19,680<br>But they said I was born in the streets of Baltimore.</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:19,680 –&gt; 00:04:20,680<br>I am from Baltimore.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:26,680 –&gt; 00:04:28,680<br>So, whatever.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:28,680 –&gt; 00:04:29,680<br>And…</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:30,680 –&gt; 00:04:32,680<br>Someone could finish that, that’d be great.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:32,680 –&gt; 00:04:35,680<br>And I did write, I’d comment, hey, I am from Baltimore.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:35,680 –&gt; 00:04:36,680<br>That’s not from the streets.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:37,680 –&gt; 00:04:40,680<br>So, I want to cover for logistics.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:40,680 –&gt; 00:04:42,680<br>This is a big class.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:42,680 –&gt; 00:04:45,680<br>Obviously, there’s a lot of people here that may have different backgrounds.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:45,680 –&gt; 00:04:48,680<br>And so, we want you to interrupt us as we’re going throughout the semester.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:48,680 –&gt; 00:04:51,680<br>And if you have questions about talking about…</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:56,680 –&gt; 00:04:57,680<br>That’s a fine question.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:58,680 –&gt; 00:05:00,680<br>I also get very excited when I talk about this.</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:00,680 –&gt; 00:05:05,680<br>Again, my life, my biological daughter, number one, is databases and then nothing else.</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:05,680 –&gt; 00:05:06,680<br>Like, I don’t talk about…</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:06,680 –&gt; 00:05:09,680<br>I have to talk about, obviously, literally, just databases.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:09,680 –&gt; 00:05:10,680<br>You can confirm.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:11,680 –&gt; 00:05:12,680<br>It is just databases, yes.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:12,680 –&gt; 00:05:14,680<br>My parents are Trump supporters, we don’t talk to them.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:14,680 –&gt; 00:05:16,680<br>Like, it is just databases.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:19,680 –&gt; 00:05:20,680<br>It’s funny to you, right?</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:21,680 –&gt; 00:05:27,680<br>All right, so again, so if you’re on the phone fast, or if you have questions, you interrupt us.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:27,680 –&gt; 00:05:32,680<br>What we’re not going to do is that at the end of the class, have people line up and say,</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:32,680 –&gt; 00:05:34,680<br>what about 4 or 5?</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:36,680 –&gt; 00:05:38,680<br>The material we discussed during the lecture, as we go along, because…</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:39,680 –&gt; 00:05:41,680<br>I want you to interrupt us as we’re talking.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:41,680 –&gt; 00:05:44,680<br>Because if you have questions, then somebody else is likely to have questions too,</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:44,680 –&gt; 00:05:45,680<br>for us to…</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:46,680 –&gt; 00:05:48,680<br>For us to answer these things and discuss it.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:48,680 –&gt; 00:05:52,680<br>And from a pedagogical standpoint, it’s better for us as well, because I go back and watch…</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:52,680 –&gt; 00:05:56,680<br>And I see where people ask questions, and I see, oh, that’s the way we didn’t get quite right.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:56,680 –&gt; 00:05:57,680<br>You go fix this lot.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:57,680 –&gt; 00:05:58,680<br>So having the questions…</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:03,680 –&gt; 00:06:05,680<br>All right, any questions about these logistics?</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:07,680 –&gt; 00:06:08,680<br>All right, boom.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:08,680 –&gt; 00:06:09,680<br>Let’s go right into it.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:09,680 –&gt; 00:06:10,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:10,680 –&gt; 00:06:12,680<br>So we’re going to talk about sort of…</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:13,680 –&gt; 00:06:16,680<br>Round of what databases are, why we need database management systems.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:16,680 –&gt; 00:06:17,680<br>By this course exists.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:18,680 –&gt; 00:06:20,680<br>Not just because we do stupid things.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:20,680 –&gt; 00:06:22,680<br>It’s a super important topic.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:22,680 –&gt; 00:06:24,680<br>And then we’ll talk about the…</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:24,680 –&gt; 00:06:30,680<br>In my opinion, the dominant model for how you want to build or use in a database system.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:30,680 –&gt; 00:06:36,680<br>Then we’ll talk about relational algebra, the mechanism, or the operators we’re used to interact with a relational model database.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:36,680 –&gt; 00:06:41,680<br>And we’ll finish up because we have to be talking about alternative models that people think…</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:41,680 –&gt; 00:06:45,680<br>…to a relational model, and I have strong opinions of why they’re wrong.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:45,680 –&gt; 00:06:46,680<br>Okay?</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:46,680 –&gt; 00:06:48,680<br>All right, so…</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:50,680 –&gt; 00:06:52,680<br>The second most important thing I like.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:52,680 –&gt; 00:06:53,680<br>Can I…?</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:58,680 –&gt; 00:06:59,680<br>SQL Server?</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:59,680 –&gt; 00:07:00,680<br>SQL Server?</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:00,680 –&gt; 00:07:01,680<br>Yes.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:01,680 –&gt; 00:07:03,680<br>If you’re in the waiting list, can you get access to PSA?</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:03,680 –&gt; 00:07:06,680<br>Yes, if you’re in the waiting list, can you get access to PSA?</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:06,680 –&gt; 00:07:08,680<br>Yes, we’ll post the…</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:08,680 –&gt; 00:07:10,680<br>…now, we’ll make that available.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:10,680 –&gt; 00:07:11,680<br>Yes.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:11,680 –&gt; 00:07:13,680<br>See, here’s a SQL Server in the back.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:15,680 –&gt; 00:07:16,680<br>My SQL…</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:17,680 –&gt; 00:07:18,680<br>Yes.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:19,680 –&gt; 00:07:21,680<br>I don’t know if it’d be one more.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:22,680 –&gt; 00:07:23,680<br>Good sound, job.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:25,680 –&gt; 00:07:28,680<br>I think everybody’s listed in SQL Server PuzzGust Mongo.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:28,680 –&gt; 00:07:30,680<br>There’s all database management systems.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:30,680 –&gt; 00:07:31,680<br>Right?</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:31,680 –&gt; 00:07:33,680<br>We’re talking databases.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:33,680 –&gt; 00:07:36,680<br>And don’t feel bad that it’s not the only one making this mistake.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:36,680 –&gt; 00:07:38,680<br>This is Jesse.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:38,680 –&gt; 00:07:40,680<br>I think this year.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:41,680 –&gt; 00:07:42,680<br>See what it plays.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:43,680 –&gt; 00:07:45,680<br>TechB for 4Place.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:45,680 –&gt; 00:07:51,680<br>A relational one of these systems presents the information to be stored and retrieved in rows and columns.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:51,680 –&gt; 00:07:52,680<br>Justin…</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:52,680 –&gt; 00:07:53,680<br>What is the matrix?</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:53,680 –&gt; 00:07:54,680<br>No.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:54,680 –&gt; 00:07:55,680<br>Fuck that.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:55,680 –&gt; 00:07:56,680<br>All right.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:00,680 –&gt; 00:08:01,680<br>It’ll get worse.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:01,680 –&gt; 00:08:02,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:02,680 –&gt; 00:08:03,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:03,680 –&gt; 00:08:04,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:04,680 –&gt; 00:08:05,680<br>Based.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:05,680 –&gt; 00:08:06,680<br>Not in it.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:06,680 –&gt; 00:08:08,680<br>I’m being pedantic here, but it’s good to understand the distinction between the two.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:08,680 –&gt; 00:08:09,680<br>Because when we…</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:09,680 –&gt; 00:08:11,680<br>Just talk about the data models, the understanding like, okay.</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:11,680 –&gt; 00:08:13,680<br>We don’t care about this maintenance.</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:13,680 –&gt; 00:08:14,680<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:14,680 –&gt; 00:08:15,680<br>Or about what data actually is.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:15,680 –&gt; 00:08:16,680<br>And how we’re going to interact with it.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:16,680 –&gt; 00:08:17,680<br>So,</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:17,680 –&gt; 00:08:22,680<br>I’ll organize collection of data that’s related to each other.</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:22,680 –&gt; 00:08:24,680<br>That’s meant to model some aspect…</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:25,680 –&gt; 00:08:27,680<br>Everybody lists data systems.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:27,680 –&gt; 00:08:31,680<br>An example of a database though would be the university database that keeps track of data.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:31,680 –&gt; 00:08:35,680<br>And the university database that keeps track of what students are enrolled in what classes in your grades.</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:35,680 –&gt; 00:08:36,680<br>Right?</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:36,680 –&gt; 00:08:38,680<br>Because that’s trying to model a…</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:38,680 –&gt; 00:08:43,680<br>The real university interactions that students are taking classes and getting grades.</p>
<p>143<br>00:08:47,680 –&gt; 00:08:54,680<br>This course is so important because the database, a array, a database, is going to be the fundamental component.</p>
<p>144<br>00:08:54,680 –&gt; 00:08:58,680<br>The unrelentive any application or anything you’re going to do with your life.</p>
<p>145<br>00:08:59,679 –&gt; 00:09:01,679<br>So, matter if you go off and get a job doing…</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:01,679 –&gt; 00:09:04,679<br>Doing CS related things or you don’t do…</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:04,679 –&gt; 00:09:06,679<br>You’re not a programmer.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:06,679 –&gt; 00:09:09,679<br>At the end of the day, you’re always going to be interacting with the database.</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:09,679 –&gt; 00:09:11,679<br>Even if it’s an Excel spreadsheet,</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:11,679 –&gt; 00:09:13,679<br>the database.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:13,679 –&gt; 00:09:14,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:14,679 –&gt; 00:09:16,679<br>That is one.</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:16,679 –&gt; 00:09:19,679<br>And this course is important because…</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:19,679 –&gt; 00:09:22,679<br>Because you’re going to be interacting with database systems,</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:22,679 –&gt; 00:09:24,679<br>you need to understand what’s acting on the inside.</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:25,679 –&gt; 00:09:31,679<br>Even if it’s a small application like running on your cell phone or a new application with the device that data,</p>
<p>157<br>00:09:31,679 –&gt; 00:09:35,679<br>it’s important to understand the queries or when you did the database system,</p>
<p>158<br>00:09:35,679 –&gt; 00:09:37,679<br>what is it actually doing?</p>
<p>159<br>00:09:37,679 –&gt; 00:09:38,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>160<br>00:09:38,679 –&gt; 00:09:44,679<br>And what are the trade-offs you would make for how you use one data model versus another or one database approach versus another?</p>
<p>161<br>00:09:44,679 –&gt; 00:09:47,679<br>So, what’s the most widely deployed database system in the world?</p>
<p>162<br>00:09:47,679 –&gt; 00:09:49,679<br>Am I taking a guess?</p>
<p>163<br>00:09:51,679 –&gt; 00:09:53,679<br>Everyone has a cell phone, right?</p>
<p>164<br>00:09:53,679 –&gt; 00:09:55,679<br>Sequel light is on every cell phone.</p>
<p>165<br>00:09:55,679 –&gt; 00:09:59,679<br>And it’s written by one dude down in North Carolina.</p>
<p>166<br>00:09:59,679 –&gt; 00:10:00,679<br>I’ve got a…</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:00,679 –&gt; 00:10:02,679<br>Like, helper doesn’t have an address.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:02,679 –&gt; 00:10:04,679<br>He’s like a… he’s like a nomad.</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:04,679 –&gt; 00:10:05,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:05,679 –&gt; 00:10:06,679<br>So, this is going to be an example of a database.</p>
<p>171<br>00:10:06,679 –&gt; 00:10:08,679<br>So, we talk to the university application.</p>
<p>172<br>00:10:08,679 –&gt; 00:10:10,679<br>We can talk about…</p>
<p>173<br>00:10:10,679 –&gt; 00:10:12,679<br>We have something more relevant to everyone here.</p>
<p>174<br>00:10:12,679 –&gt; 00:10:17,679<br>So, I think it’s like Spotify or like Bandcamp or iTunes or Keynote of Music.</p>
<p>175<br>00:10:17,679 –&gt; 00:10:22,679<br>So, we can create a really simple database that has basically two entities.</p>
<p>176<br>00:10:22,679 –&gt; 00:10:25,679<br>There are problems with artists appearing albums.</p>
<p>177<br>00:10:25,679 –&gt; 00:10:31,679<br>So, the thing we need to store in our data is it’s going to be like for every single artist, you know, what is their name, what country…</p>
<p>178<br>00:10:31,679 –&gt; 00:10:35,679<br>But they start and they have to be like, what’s the name of the album?</p>
<p>179<br>00:10:35,679 –&gt; 00:10:36,679<br>When did it come out?</p>
<p>180<br>00:10:36,679 –&gt; 00:10:38,679<br>What artists appear on it?</p>
<p>181<br>00:10:38,679 –&gt; 00:10:44,679<br>And so, what we talk about now, we’ll do a sort of straw man implementation of a database…</p>
<p>182<br>00:10:44,679 –&gt; 00:10:46,679<br>…and such this database.</p>
<p>183<br>00:10:46,679 –&gt; 00:10:48,679<br>And we’ll see why it’s stupid.</p>
<p>184<br>00:10:48,679 –&gt; 00:10:50,679<br>We see all the problems that it’s going to have.</p>
<p>185<br>00:10:50,679 –&gt; 00:10:54,679<br>And then that again, that’ll help motivate why we actually want to build a full-fledged database.</p>
<p>186<br>00:10:54,679 –&gt; 00:10:57,679<br>It’s a rely on a full-fledged database.</p>
<p>187<br>00:10:57,679 –&gt; 00:11:05,679<br>So, the easiest way to implement a database system of the manager’s data is to just use files on disk.</p>
<p>188<br>00:11:05,679 –&gt; 00:11:07,679<br>So, for every single…</p>
<p>189<br>00:11:07,679 –&gt; 00:11:12,679<br>For my two entities, I have an album, I have an artist, I have a CSV file, a comma-severative value file.</p>
<p>190<br>00:11:12,679 –&gt; 00:11:14,679<br>And every single file…</p>
<p>191<br>00:11:14,679 –&gt; 00:11:17,679<br>…tax, every single line…</p>
<p>192<br>00:11:18,679 –&gt; 00:11:20,679<br>…right?</p>
<p>193<br>00:11:20,679 –&gt; 00:11:25,679<br>It’s the time I want to find something in my…</p>
<p>194<br>00:11:25,679 –&gt; 00:11:32,679<br>I’m going to open it up, you know, parse it, line my line and try to find the data that I’m looking for.</p>
<p>195<br>00:11:32,679 –&gt; 00:11:33,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>196<br>00:11:33,679 –&gt; 00:11:36,679<br>So, say I want to do something with…</p>
<p>197<br>00:11:36,679 –&gt; 00:11:38,679<br>…right?</p>
<p>198<br>00:11:44,679 –&gt; 00:11:50,679<br>…parse as the CSV, magic work parts basically, it’s just splitting on the commas.</p>
<p>199<br>00:11:50,679 –&gt; 00:11:55,679<br>And then if I find that the name of the…</p>
<p>200<br>00:11:55,679 –&gt; 00:11:58,679<br>…then I print it out.</p>
<p>201<br>00:12:00,679 –&gt; 00:12:02,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:02,679 –&gt; 00:12:04,679<br>It works.</p>
<p>203<br>00:12:05,679 –&gt; 00:12:08,679<br>It is bad. Why?</p>
<p>204<br>00:12:10,679 –&gt; 00:12:11,679<br>Yes.</p>
<p>205<br>00:12:13,679 –&gt; 00:12:14,679<br>It says it’s…</p>
<p>206<br>00:12:14,679 –&gt; 00:12:16,679<br>…I’m really, really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow, I’m really slow.</p>
<p>207<br>00:12:16,679 –&gt; 00:12:20,679<br>Yes, I always think of an extremes in software, it says…</p>
<p>208<br>00:12:20,679 –&gt; 00:12:22,679<br>…three records here.</p>
<p>209<br>00:12:22,679 –&gt; 00:12:24,679<br>Yeah, I can load that up in a single page and parse that pretty quickly.</p>
<p>210<br>00:12:24,679 –&gt; 00:12:27,679<br>But if I have three billion records…</p>
<p>211<br>00:12:27,679 –&gt; 00:12:32,679<br>…then yeah, and if jizz is the last entry, then I got to parse every single line my line.</p>
<p>212<br>00:12:33,679 –&gt; 00:12:35,679<br>Yes, somebody’s…</p>
<p>213<br>00:12:38,679 –&gt; 00:12:43,679<br>…insertion continuation was the word of our goal of considering like system restrictions.</p>
<p>214<br>00:12:43,679 –&gt; 00:12:47,679<br>She says that the insertion deletion would be really horrible given the system restrictions.</p>
<p>215<br>00:12:47,679 –&gt; 00:12:48,679<br>So…</p>
<p>216<br>00:12:48,679 –&gt; 00:12:50,679<br>…insertion wouldn’t be that bad, right?</p>
<p>217<br>00:12:50,679 –&gt; 00:12:52,679<br>Because if I just append to the end of it, who cares?</p>
<p>218<br>00:12:52,679 –&gt; 00:12:53,679<br>Right?</p>
<p>219<br>00:12:54,679 –&gt; 00:12:56,679<br>…I think it’s a little…</p>
<p>220<br>00:12:59,679 –&gt; 00:13:02,679<br>…right, so she said, what if I keep thinking forwarded by release year?</p>
<p>221<br>00:13:02,679 –&gt; 00:13:06,679<br>Then yeah, I have to go find where it should be…</p>
<p>222<br>00:13:06,679 –&gt; 00:13:08,679<br>…that would suck, right?</p>
<p>223<br>00:13:08,679 –&gt; 00:13:11,679<br>You also said update or delete, right?</p>
<p>224<br>00:13:11,679 –&gt; 00:13:15,679<br>If I wanted to delete entry, I get it to the same problem as looking for it, I got to find the thing I’m looking for and delete it.</p>
<p>225<br>00:13:15,679 –&gt; 00:13:20,679<br>Those are implementation issues, but there’s some other problems as well.</p>
<p>226<br>00:13:21,679 –&gt; 00:13:23,679<br>So, in from the problem, back to the first thing, if there’s any kind of…</p>
<p>227<br>00:13:23,679 –&gt; 00:13:25,679<br>…in that, then you didn’t go on that way.</p>
<p>228<br>00:13:25,679 –&gt; 00:13:29,679<br>So, your statement is that I’m representing everything as say strings, and if there’s a what?</p>
<p>229<br>00:13:29,679 –&gt; 00:13:32,679<br>Also, in the 40s, we are working with 90, 90s.</p>
<p>230<br>00:13:32,679 –&gt; 00:13:35,679<br>So, it’s actually somebody who’s stuck…</p>
<p>231<br>00:13:38,679 –&gt; 00:13:40,679<br>…not in there.</p>
<p>232<br>00:13:40,679 –&gt; 00:13:41,679<br>Yeah, correct, yeah.</p>
<p>233<br>00:13:41,679 –&gt; 00:13:42,679<br>So, her comment is…</p>
<p>234<br>00:13:42,679 –&gt; 00:13:43,679<br>…I’m not going to say that.</p>
<p>235<br>00:13:43,679 –&gt; 00:13:44,679<br>…but I’m not going to say that.</p>
<p>236<br>00:13:44,679 –&gt; 00:13:45,679<br>So, I’m not going to say that.</p>
<p>237<br>00:13:45,679 –&gt; 00:13:46,679<br>I’m not going to say that.</p>
<p>238<br>00:13:46,679 –&gt; 00:13:47,679<br>I’m not going to say that.</p>
<p>239<br>00:13:48,679 –&gt; 00:13:49,679<br>…not going to say that.</p>
<p>240<br>00:13:49,679 –&gt; 00:13:50,679<br>Yeah, correct, yeah.</p>
<p>241<br>00:13:50,679 –&gt; 00:13:51,679<br>So, her comment is…</p>
<p>242<br>00:13:51,679 –&gt; 00:13:52,679<br>…I’m still…</p>
<p>243<br>00:13:52,679 –&gt; 00:13:56,679<br>…I’m still in the years, and in this case, it’s text files, so it’s asking text.</p>
<p>244<br>00:13:56,679 –&gt; 00:14:04,679<br>But my magic parse function, which I haven’t defined, is somehow knowing, oh, this should be an integer, and it’s going to call A to I.</p>
<p>245<br>00:14:04,679 –&gt; 00:14:08,679<br>It’s going to cast the bar far into a string to an integer.</p>
<p>246<br>00:14:08,679 –&gt; 00:14:10,679<br>And then, someone’s in the back…</p>
<p>247<br>00:14:10,679 –&gt; 00:14:13,679<br>…it’s just a bunch of files on disk.</p>
<p>248<br>00:14:14,679 –&gt; 00:14:15,679<br>A parsing error.</p>
<p>249<br>00:14:15,679 –&gt; 00:14:16,679<br>It’s a crop.</p>
<p>250<br>00:14:16,679 –&gt; 00:14:17,679<br>That’s a good one.</p>
<p>251<br>00:14:21,679 –&gt; 00:14:22,679<br>What are some other problems?</p>
<p>252<br>00:14:22,679 –&gt; 00:14:25,679<br>…reading and writing the file gets you.</p>
<p>253<br>00:14:25,679 –&gt; 00:14:27,679<br>You say, reading and writing the file is like…</p>
<p>254<br>00:14:27,679 –&gt; 00:14:28,679<br>…maybe we sort of covered that, right?</p>
<p>255<br>00:14:28,679 –&gt; 00:14:31,679<br>Like, if you’re inserting the end, no big deal.</p>
<p>256<br>00:14:32,679 –&gt; 00:14:33,679<br>Reading…</p>
<p>257<br>00:14:33,679 –&gt; 00:14:35,679<br>…could make it…</p>
<p>258<br>00:14:35,679 –&gt; 00:14:36,679<br>…well…</p>
<p>259<br>00:14:36,679 –&gt; 00:14:37,679<br>…yes.</p>
<p>260<br>00:14:38,679 –&gt; 00:14:40,679<br>…like, you’re…</p>
<p>261<br>00:14:40,679 –&gt; 00:14:42,679<br>…it’s the comment in the name, right, break.</p>
<p>262<br>00:14:42,679 –&gt; 00:14:43,679<br>The…</p>
<p>263<br>00:14:43,679 –&gt; 00:14:45,679<br>…like, Python packages for…</p>
<p>264<br>00:14:45,679 –&gt; 00:14:46,679<br>…it’s a part of that.</p>
<p>265<br>00:14:46,679 –&gt; 00:14:47,679<br>Yes.</p>
<p>266<br>00:14:47,679 –&gt; 00:14:50,679<br>…you’re not able to have like, this branch…</p>
<p>267<br>00:14:50,679 –&gt; 00:14:52,679<br>…you’re not able to have current use of the file.</p>
<p>268<br>00:14:52,679 –&gt; 00:14:54,679<br>…you’re not able to have current use of the file.</p>
<p>269<br>00:14:54,679 –&gt; 00:14:56,679<br>…the writers, things get a little dicey.</p>
<p>270<br>00:14:56,679 –&gt; 00:14:57,679<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>271<br>00:14:57,679 –&gt; 00:14:58,679<br>…alright.</p>
<p>272<br>00:14:59,679 –&gt; 00:15:02,679<br>…the way the fact that this is the OSN figures…</p>
<p>273<br>00:15:02,679 –&gt; 00:15:03,679<br>…is…</p>
<p>274<br>00:15:03,679 –&gt; 00:15:04,679<br>…the way it is.</p>
<p>275<br>00:15:04,679 –&gt; 00:15:05,679<br>Yeah, per-s.</p>
<p>276<br>00:15:05,679 –&gt; 00:15:07,679<br>…and then…</p>
<p>277<br>00:15:11,679 –&gt; 00:15:13,679<br>…then…</p>
<p>278<br>00:15:29,679 –&gt; 00:15:31,679<br>…so the small sort of…</p>
<p>279<br>00:15:31,679 –&gt; 00:15:32,679<br>…so the file…</p>
<p>280<br>00:15:32,679 –&gt; 00:15:33,679<br>…the small sort of the…</p>
<p>281<br>00:15:33,679 –&gt; 00:15:34,679<br>…the form of the…</p>
<p>282<br>00:15:34,679 –&gt; 00:15:37,739<br>is implicitly relevant.</p>
<p>283<br>00:15:37,739 –&gt; 00:15:38,799<br>That’ll cause problems.</p>
<p>284<br>00:15:38,799 –&gt; 00:15:41,039<br>We’ll see in a second.</p>
<p>285<br>00:15:41,039 –&gt; 00:15:43,599<br>So we covered all the things.</p>
<p>286<br>00:15:43,599 –&gt; 00:15:51,000<br>So how do we make sure that going back or quickly?</p>
<p>287<br>00:15:54,599 –&gt; 00:15:54,839<br>Right?</p>
<p>288<br>00:15:54,839 –&gt; 00:15:55,599<br>So I have woo-s.</p>
<p>289<br>00:16:01,479 –&gt; 00:16:02,719<br>So I’m going to go fix it.</p>
<p>290<br>00:16:02,719 –&gt; 00:16:04,519<br>I’ve got to make sure that every single place where</p>
<p>291<br>00:16:04,519 –&gt; 00:16:08,720<br>I have, oh, it all gets updated the same.</p>
<p>292<br>00:16:08,720 –&gt; 00:16:10,600<br>I guess these are just a little bit different.</p>
<p>293<br>00:16:10,600 –&gt; 00:16:14,360<br>The operating system does the file system doesn’t know.</p>
<p>294<br>00:16:14,360 –&gt; 00:16:18,439<br>It just knows that whatever you want to read right.</p>
<p>295<br>00:16:18,439 –&gt; 00:16:21,519<br>So we now in the application to go,</p>
<p>296<br>00:16:21,519 –&gt; 00:16:26,639<br>we make sure all the entries will be in the instructions.</p>
<p>297<br>00:16:26,639 –&gt; 00:16:28,720<br>She brought up the issue of what someone overrights a year</p>
<p>298<br>00:16:28,720 –&gt; 00:16:29,879<br>with them valid string.</p>
<p>299<br>00:16:29,879 –&gt; 00:16:31,600<br>We throw a parsing error.</p>
<p>300<br>00:16:31,600 –&gt; 00:16:34,319<br>In my example here, I’m assuming there’s</p>
<p>301<br>00:16:34,320 –&gt; 00:16:39,920<br>one correspondence between one and one artist.</p>
<p>302<br>00:16:39,920 –&gt; 00:16:43,040<br>But obviously we know that’s not the case in a lot of albums.</p>
<p>303<br>00:16:43,040 –&gt; 00:16:48,720<br>So how do I go change my files now to go account for that?</p>
<p>304<br>00:16:48,720 –&gt; 00:16:51,840<br>What is a lead and artist who has albums?</p>
<p>305<br>00:16:51,840 –&gt; 00:16:53,920<br>What’s the name of that?</p>
<p>306<br>00:16:53,920 –&gt; 00:16:54,420<br>Right?</p>
<p>307<br>00:16:54,420 –&gt; 00:16:56,720<br>Well, in my example here, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>308<br>00:16:56,720 –&gt; 00:16:59,320<br>And now I got a bunch of albums that have an artist name</p>
<p>309<br>00:16:59,320 –&gt; 00:17:03,360<br>that doesn’t map anything to the reference</p>
<p>310<br>00:17:03,360 –&gt; 00:17:06,160<br>on the tag that he gets broken.</p>
<p>311<br>00:17:06,160 –&gt; 00:17:08,079<br>We brought a lot of the implementation issues already.</p>
<p>312<br>00:17:08,079 –&gt; 00:17:09,599<br>Like how do you find it?</p>
<p>313<br>00:17:09,599 –&gt; 00:17:12,599<br>In my example here, it’s it’s O N. Right?</p>
<p>314<br>00:17:12,599 –&gt; 00:17:15,599<br>It’s a I have to do a brute force scan,</p>
<p>315<br>00:17:15,599 –&gt; 00:17:16,880<br>screenshot scan across the entire file</p>
<p>316<br>00:17:16,880 –&gt; 00:17:18,880<br>to find the thing I’m looking for.</p>
<p>317<br>00:17:18,880 –&gt; 00:17:23,839<br>Now, if I assume that there’s only one person that, you know,</p>
<p>318<br>00:17:23,839 –&gt; 00:17:26,640<br>only one artist with a given name, then I can start</p>
<p>319<br>00:17:26,640 –&gt; 00:17:28,160<br>because I’m done.</p>
<p>320<br>00:17:28,160 –&gt; 00:17:29,799<br>Part of the same name all the time.</p>
<p>321<br>00:17:30,519 –&gt; 00:17:34,119<br>Albums that, I don’t know, Jizo puts out,</p>
<p>322<br>00:17:34,119 –&gt; 00:17:36,200<br>just like Jizo and Florida or something like that.</p>
<p>323<br>00:17:36,200 –&gt; 00:17:38,839<br>I got to keep scanning the entire file.</p>
<p>324<br>00:17:38,839 –&gt; 00:17:40,960<br>And that’s going to be N or N, order N.</p>
<p>325<br>00:17:42,960 –&gt; 00:17:45,399<br>In my example here, I have a little bit of a</p>
<p>326<br>00:17:45,399 –&gt; 00:17:47,919<br>that’s operating on the files.</p>
<p>327<br>00:17:47,919 –&gt; 00:17:50,240<br>But let’s say I want to rewrite it to now run it.</p>
<p>328<br>00:17:50,240 –&gt; 00:17:52,440<br>I want to write a new application that uses the same database,</p>
<p>329<br>00:17:52,440 –&gt; 00:17:55,480<br>but I want to write it in Rust because that’s the hot thing.</p>
<p>330<br>00:17:55,480 –&gt; 00:17:58,639<br>So now I got to go make sure that whatever information</p>
<p>331<br>00:17:58,640 –&gt; 00:18:01,440<br>it implicit scheme I had in my Python code now maps over</p>
<p>332<br>00:18:01,440 –&gt; 00:18:02,960<br>to my Rust code.</p>
<p>333<br>00:18:02,960 –&gt; 00:18:05,600<br>But then now if my files change, I got to make sure I go change</p>
<p>334<br>00:18:05,600 –&gt; 00:18:07,800<br>both the Python code and the Rust code.</p>
<p>335<br>00:18:07,800 –&gt; 00:18:11,360<br>And you say the guy that wrote the Python code is in jail</p>
<p>336<br>00:18:11,360 –&gt; 00:18:13,960<br>and we can’t update it.</p>
<p>337<br>00:18:13,960 –&gt; 00:18:14,480<br>Right?</p>
<p>338<br>00:18:14,480 –&gt; 00:18:16,759<br>Now what do I do?</p>
<p>339<br>00:18:16,759 –&gt; 00:18:18,480<br>I’m going to break.</p>
<p>340<br>00:18:18,480 –&gt; 00:18:21,960<br>What if the app is on the same machine where my Python code is</p>
<p>341<br>00:18:21,960 –&gt; 00:18:22,480<br>running?</p>
<p>342<br>00:18:22,480 –&gt; 00:18:22,720<br>Right?</p>
<p>343<br>00:18:22,720 –&gt; 00:18:25,120<br>It’s running like a microservice on a separate box.</p>
<p>344<br>00:18:25,120 –&gt; 00:18:27,280<br>How do I get access to that other?</p>
<p>345<br>00:18:27,359 –&gt; 00:18:31,000<br>How do I get access to that file?</p>
<p>346<br>00:18:31,000 –&gt; 00:18:36,319<br>And then what happens if you have two threads trying to write</p>
<p>347<br>00:18:36,319 –&gt; 00:18:38,599<br>to the same file, the same?</p>
<p>348<br>00:18:38,599 –&gt; 00:18:42,680<br>Well, you can rely on the operating system to do.</p>
<p>349<br>00:18:42,680 –&gt; 00:18:44,680<br>But again, if I have a billion records, and I want to update</p>
<p>350<br>00:18:44,680 –&gt; 00:18:47,160<br>one of them, I want to lock a billion records,</p>
<p>351<br>00:18:47,160 –&gt; 00:18:48,519<br>just do that one up.</p>
<p>352<br>00:18:48,519 –&gt; 00:18:50,399<br>I really want to have something more fine-grained that</p>
<p>353<br>00:18:50,399 –&gt; 00:18:51,759<br>can have multiple threads.</p>
<p>354<br>00:18:51,759 –&gt; 00:18:59,200<br>And then no matter what it was, I had to make sure that our data</p>
<p>355<br>00:18:59,200 –&gt; 00:19:00,160<br>is safe.</p>
<p>356<br>00:19:00,160 –&gt; 00:19:00,960<br>There’s a crash.</p>
<p>357<br>00:19:00,960 –&gt; 00:19:01,960<br>Right?</p>
<p>358<br>00:19:01,960 –&gt; 00:19:06,680<br>I need a file.</p>
<p>359<br>00:19:06,680 –&gt; 00:19:11,519<br>And then I crash before I fsync, some of that data actually</p>
<p>360<br>00:19:11,519 –&gt; 00:19:13,160<br>might have gotten out the disk.</p>
<p>361<br>00:19:13,160 –&gt; 00:19:19,879<br>So when my computer is going to be 20, which is not what I want,</p>
<p>362<br>00:19:19,960 –&gt; 00:19:23,040<br>because now I’ve cropped the data.</p>
<p>363<br>00:19:23,040 –&gt; 00:19:26,600<br>Or now my disk is really big, and I have a lot of people</p>
<p>364<br>00:19:26,600 –&gt; 00:19:27,760<br>want to access it.</p>
<p>365<br>00:19:27,760 –&gt; 00:19:31,000<br>How do I make sure that I can duplicate and replicate across</p>
<p>366<br>00:19:31,000 –&gt; 00:19:34,400<br>multiple machines so they can all service reads at the same time?</p>
<p>367<br>00:19:34,400 –&gt; 00:19:36,920<br>So my application can scale out.</p>
<p>368<br>00:19:36,920 –&gt; 00:19:40,040<br>Files aren’t going to do that for me.</p>
<p>369<br>00:19:40,040 –&gt; 00:19:45,520<br>So this is just a quick smattering of the management system,</p>
<p>370<br>00:19:45,520 –&gt; 00:19:48,640<br>and why, of course, like this, in my opinion.</p>
<p>371<br>00:19:48,640 –&gt; 00:19:52,440<br>So as our management management system is going to be the software</p>
<p>372<br>00:19:52,440 –&gt; 00:19:55,840<br>that can allow applications to store and analyze information</p>
<p>373<br>00:19:55,840 –&gt; 00:20:00,240<br>in a database, and ideally not have to worry about all the things</p>
<p>374<br>00:20:00,240 –&gt; 00:20:02,040<br>that we just talked about.</p>
<p>375<br>00:20:02,040 –&gt; 00:20:03,360<br>That’s not always been the case.</p>
<p>376<br>00:20:03,360 –&gt; 00:20:06,480<br>There’s me trade-offs to the big app.</p>
<p>377<br>00:20:09,600 –&gt; 00:20:13,480<br>You know, the big thing is it exchange for performance.</p>
<p>378<br>00:20:13,480 –&gt; 00:20:15,920<br>And a general purpose system typically</p>
<p>379<br>00:20:15,920 –&gt; 00:20:18,840<br>allow you to adjust what the trade-offs actually are.</p>
<p>380<br>00:20:21,880 –&gt; 00:20:28,960<br>And so the data system is going to define or specify</p>
<p>381<br>00:20:28,960 –&gt; 00:20:31,880<br>inherent instantivitation how you can go create databases,</p>
<p>382<br>00:20:31,880 –&gt; 00:20:34,840<br>how you can query them, how you can change it,</p>
<p>383<br>00:20:34,840 –&gt; 00:20:36,600<br>you can administer the databases, making</p>
<p>384<br>00:20:36,600 –&gt; 00:20:39,920<br>some changes in other things, and sort of correspondence</p>
<p>385<br>00:20:39,920 –&gt; 00:20:42,880<br>of some kind of data model.</p>
<p>386<br>00:20:42,880 –&gt; 00:20:44,960<br>Well, I’ll say also, too, that this is, again,</p>
<p>387<br>00:20:44,960 –&gt; 00:20:48,360<br>no matter whether you go off and actually build database systems</p>
<p>388<br>00:20:48,360 –&gt; 00:20:51,120<br>in your data job, this is going to be important, again,</p>
<p>389<br>00:20:51,120 –&gt; 00:20:52,960<br>where you go, because at some point you’re</p>
<p>390<br>00:20:52,960 –&gt; 00:20:55,360<br>going to build some application, you have to decide what</p>
<p>391<br>00:20:55,360 –&gt; 00:20:57,240<br>database management system I want to use.</p>
<p>392<br>00:20:57,240 –&gt; 00:20:58,960<br>And that’s going to always be the first choice.</p>
<p>393<br>00:20:58,960 –&gt; 00:21:01,640<br>But you don’t want to do my, but here,</p>
<p>394<br>00:21:01,640 –&gt; 00:21:06,720<br>it’s going to be a lot of problems.</p>
<p>395<br>00:21:06,720 –&gt; 00:21:09,000<br>I was like, do you think you’re at a startup</p>
<p>396<br>00:21:09,000 –&gt; 00:21:13,519<br>and you’re trying to build an application, a brick application?</p>
<p>397<br>00:21:13,519 –&gt; 00:21:14,799<br>Start doesn’t have a lot of money.</p>
<p>398<br>00:21:14,799 –&gt; 00:21:17,319<br>You’re stressed for time to try to get things out the door.</p>
<p>399<br>00:21:17,319 –&gt; 00:21:18,839<br>They get the first version out the door.</p>
<p>400<br>00:21:18,839 –&gt; 00:21:20,139<br>Do you really want to be spending your time</p>
<p>401<br>00:21:20,139 –&gt; 00:21:23,799<br>making sure that your data is safe, and there’s a crash?</p>
<p>402<br>00:21:23,799 –&gt; 00:21:25,720<br>Because at the end, that’s not a just in-eaching feature</p>
<p>403<br>00:21:25,720 –&gt; 00:21:27,359<br>of your business or your application.</p>
<p>404<br>00:21:27,359 –&gt; 00:21:29,960<br>Nobody cares, and if you actually lose data,</p>
<p>405<br>00:21:29,960 –&gt; 00:21:31,839<br>or if you crash, you don’t lose data.</p>
<p>406<br>00:21:31,839 –&gt; 00:21:35,519<br>That’s considered, like, at this point,</p>
<p>407<br>00:21:35,519 –&gt; 00:21:38,240<br>in modern computing systems.</p>
<p>408<br>00:21:38,240 –&gt; 00:21:40,559<br>And so rather than spending all this time trying to</p>
<p>409<br>00:21:40,559 –&gt; 00:21:42,679<br>get your own bespoke database system,</p>
<p>410<br>00:21:42,679 –&gt; 00:21:44,919<br>you should use something else.</p>
<p>411<br>00:21:44,919 –&gt; 00:21:47,079<br>Changes are its private-based press</p>
<p>412<br>00:21:47,079 –&gt; 00:21:49,879<br>in that of 100.</p>
<p>413<br>00:21:49,879 –&gt; 00:21:51,879<br>That’s the first choice you should use.</p>
<p>414<br>00:21:51,879 –&gt; 00:21:53,879<br>Maybe steeply.</p>
<p>415<br>00:21:53,879 –&gt; 00:21:56,559<br>But post-culture pretty far.</p>
<p>416<br>00:21:59,839 –&gt; 00:22:03,839<br>That I’m talking about here.</p>
<p>417<br>00:22:03,839 –&gt; 00:22:06,240<br>So again, a data model is going to be,</p>
<p>418<br>00:22:06,240 –&gt; 00:22:10,279<br>and how we’re going to represent entities,</p>
<p>419<br>00:22:10,279 –&gt; 00:22:13,160<br>or the collection of data in our database.</p>
<p>420<br>00:22:13,160 –&gt; 00:22:21,240<br>So the data model is this high-level abstraction,</p>
<p>421<br>00:22:21,240 –&gt; 00:22:24,279<br>specifies how we represent individual entities,</p>
<p>422<br>00:22:24,279 –&gt; 00:22:26,960<br>and potentially the relationship.</p>
<p>423<br>00:22:26,960 –&gt; 00:22:28,480<br>Again, we’re trying to model some aspects</p>
<p>424<br>00:22:28,480 –&gt; 00:22:29,160<br>of the real world.</p>
<p>425<br>00:22:29,160 –&gt; 00:22:30,120<br>Students take classes.</p>
<p>426<br>00:22:30,120 –&gt; 00:22:32,079<br>Students get grades.</p>
<p>427<br>00:22:32,079 –&gt; 00:22:35,359<br>They’re at home department.</p>
<p>428<br>00:22:35,359 –&gt; 00:22:38,839<br>And then the schema is going to represent the definition,</p>
<p>429<br>00:22:38,839 –&gt; 00:22:46,199<br>or the description, of what those entities in our database</p>
<p>430<br>00:22:46,199 –&gt; 00:22:47,919<br>look like.</p>
<p>431<br>00:22:47,919 –&gt; 00:22:48,919<br>Students have names.</p>
<p>432<br>00:22:48,919 –&gt; 00:22:52,159<br>Students have birthdays, have email addresses, and so forth.</p>
<p>433<br>00:22:52,159 –&gt; 00:22:54,879<br>You would specify all of those in our schema.</p>
<p>434<br>00:22:54,879 –&gt; 00:22:58,159<br>And then we would instantiate instances of a database</p>
<p>435<br>00:22:58,159 –&gt; 00:23:02,959<br>based on a data model according to the schema.</p>
<p>436<br>00:23:02,959 –&gt; 00:23:05,199<br>So there’s a bunch of different data models that are out there.</p>
<p>437<br>00:23:05,720 –&gt; 00:23:07,880<br>This goes back to the very beginning of databases.</p>
<p>438<br>00:23:07,880 –&gt; 00:23:10,400<br>People were sort of realized, oh, we need a database.</p>
<p>439<br>00:23:10,400 –&gt; 00:23:13,519<br>Is in a database.</p>
<p>440<br>00:23:13,519 –&gt; 00:23:17,559<br>So most database systems today, something that</p>
<p>441<br>00:23:17,559 –&gt; 00:23:19,480<br>looks like the relational database,</p>
<p>442<br>00:23:19,480 –&gt; 00:23:21,519<br>relational data model.</p>
<p>443<br>00:23:21,519 –&gt; 00:23:23,360<br>There’s things called object relational,</p>
<p>444<br>00:23:23,360 –&gt; 00:23:24,200<br>what postgres is.</p>
<p>445<br>00:23:24,200 –&gt; 00:23:26,039<br>It just means you can have user-defined types</p>
<p>446<br>00:23:26,039 –&gt; 00:23:29,840<br>to extend what your relations are, extend.</p>
<p>447<br>00:23:29,840 –&gt; 00:23:32,880<br>But in a high-level, most database systems</p>
<p>448<br>00:23:32,880 –&gt; 00:23:34,200<br>are going to be relational.</p>
<p>449<br>00:23:34,200 –&gt; 00:23:37,120<br>I think there’s that DB engines, the ranking,</p>
<p>450<br>00:23:37,120 –&gt; 00:23:38,519<br>the most popular database.</p>
<p>451<br>00:23:38,519 –&gt; 00:23:40,720<br>I think the four out of the five most popular databases</p>
<p>452<br>00:23:40,720 –&gt; 00:23:42,240<br>are going to be all relational.</p>
<p>453<br>00:23:42,240 –&gt; 00:23:45,519<br>Mongo is the other.</p>
<p>454<br>00:23:45,519 –&gt; 00:23:47,840<br>Then there’s a bunch of these other data models</p>
<p>455<br>00:23:47,840 –&gt; 00:23:52,480<br>that fall under this umbrella term of a few thing</p>
<p>456<br>00:23:52,480 –&gt; 00:23:53,319<br>on new SQL systems.</p>
<p>457<br>00:23:53,319 –&gt; 00:23:57,799<br>It’s usually the document data model from JSON, one of these.</p>
<p>458<br>00:23:57,799 –&gt; 00:24:01,000<br>Cassandra essentially has become one of these.</p>
<p>459<br>00:24:01,000 –&gt; 00:24:03,920<br>But there’s key value stores, F databases,</p>
<p>460<br>00:24:03,960 –&gt; 00:24:06,720<br>and then what the company is, is it sort of the best right?</p>
<p>461<br>00:24:23,880 –&gt; 00:24:26,840<br>There’s array, matrix, and vector data models.</p>
<p>462<br>00:24:26,840 –&gt; 00:24:29,759<br>These are primarily used for machine learning</p>
<p>463<br>00:24:29,759 –&gt; 00:24:32,279<br>or scientific equations.</p>
<p>464<br>00:24:32,279 –&gt; 00:24:34,519<br>I think of a satellite going around, take a bunch of photos.</p>
<p>465<br>00:24:34,519 –&gt; 00:24:39,039<br>You can store that as an array, or tensors to trains</p>
<p>466<br>00:24:39,039 –&gt; 00:24:40,039<br>with a model.</p>
<p>467<br>00:24:40,039 –&gt; 00:24:42,200<br>You represent that as well.</p>
<p>468<br>00:24:42,200 –&gt; 00:24:43,480<br>And so there’s specialized database</p>
<p>469<br>00:24:43,480 –&gt; 00:24:47,799<br>that can be made to represent a array.</p>
<p>470<br>00:24:47,799 –&gt; 00:24:50,319<br>And then there’s ones at the end for old people,</p>
<p>471<br>00:24:50,319 –&gt; 00:24:54,200<br>hierarchical network and multi-value.</p>
<p>472<br>00:24:54,200 –&gt; 00:24:58,160<br>These are considered obsolete at this point.</p>
<p>473<br>00:24:58,160 –&gt; 00:25:02,040<br>So they still make a lot of money.</p>
<p>474<br>00:25:02,040 –&gt; 00:25:05,519<br>The hierarchical model is used in IMF.</p>
<p>475<br>00:25:05,519 –&gt; 00:25:08,200<br>IBM’s first database system that they built</p>
<p>476<br>00:25:08,200 –&gt; 00:25:15,080<br>of all the parts for the department in the 1960s.</p>
<p>477<br>00:25:15,080 –&gt; 00:25:18,320<br>Let’s move on.</p>
<p>478<br>00:25:18,320 –&gt; 00:25:21,519<br>Every ATM basically uses, I mean, not the box itself,</p>
<p>479<br>00:25:21,519 –&gt; 00:25:24,240<br>when you communicate to the bank.</p>
<p>480<br>00:25:24,240 –&gt; 00:25:26,320<br>A lot of these systems are using IMF.</p>
<p>481<br>00:25:26,319 –&gt; 00:25:35,119<br>So these things exist, but you feel brand new part of it.</p>
<p>482<br>00:25:35,119 –&gt; 00:25:37,919<br>You’re not going to use IMS, or I’m going to use IDMS.</p>
<p>483<br>00:25:37,919 –&gt; 00:25:40,119<br>Like, you’d be insane to do that.</p>
<p>484<br>00:25:40,119 –&gt; 00:25:44,519<br>But again, not at all, because it’s not really relevant here.</p>
<p>485<br>00:25:44,519 –&gt; 00:25:47,679<br>For this course, we will have some database</p>
<p>486<br>00:25:47,679 –&gt; 00:25:50,200<br>as an evolution data model.</p>
<p>487<br>00:25:50,200 –&gt; 00:25:51,759<br>And this is why we always pissed off about the Japanese</p>
<p>488<br>00:25:51,759 –&gt; 00:25:53,720<br>because we go back to it.</p>
<p>489<br>00:25:53,720 –&gt; 00:25:57,000<br>Justin, the judges have reviewed your response of matrix</p>
<p>490<br>00:25:57,000 –&gt; 00:25:58,240<br>in the tech-beat category.</p>
<p>491<br>00:25:58,240 –&gt; 00:26:00,799<br>And they have decided that it is correct.</p>
<p>492<br>00:26:00,799 –&gt; 00:26:02,759<br>We’ve added $800 to your score.</p>
<p>493<br>00:26:02,759 –&gt; 00:26:06,920<br>And all of your wagers were made on the adjusted score.</p>
<p>494<br>00:26:06,920 –&gt; 00:26:10,319<br>There’s no such thing as a relational matrix.</p>
<p>495<br>00:26:10,319 –&gt; 00:26:11,079<br>I send them an email.</p>
<p>496<br>00:26:11,079 –&gt; 00:26:11,920<br>They didn’t respond.</p>
<p>497<br>00:26:11,920 –&gt; 00:26:12,920<br>OK.</p>
<p>498<br>00:26:12,920 –&gt; 00:26:14,920<br>OK.</p>
<p>499<br>00:26:14,920 –&gt; 00:26:21,519<br>Anyway, I think it’s a neuroscience, but like, no, whatever.</p>
<p>500<br>00:26:21,519 –&gt; 00:26:25,319<br>So hopefully, if nothing else ends this course,</p>
<p>501<br>00:26:25,319 –&gt; 00:26:26,240<br>you can answer that question.</p>
<p>502<br>00:26:29,319 –&gt; 00:26:31,639<br>So let’s go back to the 1960.</p>
<p>503<br>00:26:31,639 –&gt; 00:26:33,879<br>And this will get to motivate why the relational model</p>
<p>504<br>00:26:33,879 –&gt; 00:26:34,839<br>came about.</p>
<p>505<br>00:26:34,839 –&gt; 00:26:38,200<br>And it’ll set us up for once, and why it’s still prevalent</p>
<p>506<br>00:26:38,200 –&gt; 00:26:39,759<br>in the VU today.</p>
<p>507<br>00:26:39,759 –&gt; 00:26:42,559<br>And pin it in for any new.</p>
<p>508<br>00:26:42,559 –&gt; 00:26:43,559<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>509<br>00:26:45,559 –&gt; 00:26:48,119<br>Back in the 1960s, early 1970s.</p>
<p>510<br>00:26:52,039 –&gt; 00:26:52,960<br>There wasn’t a relational model.</p>
<p>511<br>00:26:52,960 –&gt; 00:26:54,000<br>It wasn’t relational database.</p>
<p>512<br>00:26:54,000 –&gt; 00:26:54,799<br>There wasn’t Postgres.</p>
<p>513<br>00:26:54,799 –&gt; 00:26:56,319<br>There wasn’t my SQL SQLite Mongo.</p>
<p>514<br>00:26:56,319 –&gt; 00:26:57,319<br>Right?</p>
<p>515<br>00:26:57,319 –&gt; 00:27:02,319<br>The first 80s, the first 80s, people were building were not</p>
<p>516<br>00:27:02,319 –&gt; 00:27:03,559<br>meant to be general purpose.</p>
<p>517<br>00:27:03,559 –&gt; 00:27:06,279<br>But then they realized, oh, instead of building these bespoke</p>
<p>518<br>00:27:06,279 –&gt; 00:27:09,200<br>database applications or database systems for just this one</p>
<p>519<br>00:27:09,200 –&gt; 00:27:11,599<br>application, I can make a bit more general.</p>
<p>520<br>00:27:11,599 –&gt; 00:27:14,279<br>And now I can support any possible application.</p>
<p>521<br>00:27:14,279 –&gt; 00:27:17,920<br>So as far as the first 80s system ever existed,</p>
<p>522<br>00:27:18,640 –&gt; 00:27:24,279<br>but built by General Electric, then sold to Honeywell,</p>
<p>523<br>00:27:24,279 –&gt; 00:27:25,200<br>1960s.</p>
<p>524<br>00:27:25,200 –&gt; 00:27:29,360<br>But IDS, they originally built to keep the Seattle.</p>
<p>525<br>00:27:29,360 –&gt; 00:27:31,640<br>And then they realized, oh, instead of building this just</p>
<p>526<br>00:27:31,640 –&gt; 00:27:34,039<br>for the company, we can make some tweaks and make it</p>
<p>527<br>00:27:34,039 –&gt; 00:27:37,440<br>so the company could use it or a company could use it.</p>
<p>528<br>00:27:37,440 –&gt; 00:27:39,600<br>And that sort of became the one of the first general purpose</p>
<p>529<br>00:27:39,600 –&gt; 00:27:41,080<br>database systems that ever built.</p>
<p>530<br>00:27:41,579 –&gt; 00:27:48,079<br>So I’d say, I’d say, oh, we could use this for other applications,</p>
<p>531<br>00:27:48,079 –&gt; 00:27:56,199<br>and they generalized it.</p>
<p>532<br>00:27:56,199 –&gt; 00:28:02,000<br>And then COSIL is a standards that defined the late 60s</p>
<p>533<br>00:28:02,000 –&gt; 00:28:08,240<br>or 70s as a way to interact with data systems.</p>
<p>534<br>00:28:08,240 –&gt; 00:28:10,240<br>People realize instead of having these</p>
<p>535<br>00:28:10,240 –&gt; 00:28:14,240<br>one, the aim of the system is that we’re being built at the time,</p>
<p>536<br>00:28:14,240 –&gt; 00:28:16,240<br>we would have an enterprise way for how</p>
<p>537<br>00:28:16,240 –&gt; 00:28:18,240<br>good applications are.</p>
<p>538<br>00:28:18,240 –&gt; 00:28:22,240<br>Less than 5%.</p>
<p>539<br>00:28:22,240 –&gt; 00:28:24,240<br>Or 5%.</p>
<p>540<br>00:28:24,240 –&gt; 00:28:27,240<br>I’m assuming two here are going to have to code a seal.</p>
<p>541<br>00:28:27,240 –&gt; 00:28:28,240<br>One.</p>
<p>542<br>00:28:28,240 –&gt; 00:28:29,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>543<br>00:28:29,240 –&gt; 00:28:31,240<br>So why?</p>
<p>544<br>00:28:31,240 –&gt; 00:28:33,240<br>You’re writing the book.</p>
<p>545<br>00:28:33,240 –&gt; 00:28:35,240<br>You’re writing the book.</p>
<p>546<br>00:28:35,240 –&gt; 00:28:36,240<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>547<br>00:28:36,240 –&gt; 00:28:42,240<br>So people, and these early systems,</p>
<p>548<br>00:28:42,240 –&gt; 00:28:45,240<br>this is the way we’d enact the system.</p>
<p>549<br>00:28:45,240 –&gt; 00:28:49,240<br>And a lot of the things that were inherent in these first</p>
<p>550<br>00:28:49,240 –&gt; 00:28:52,240<br>implementations are things you would not want to do today.</p>
<p>551<br>00:28:52,240 –&gt; 00:28:54,240<br>And the one that big things was in these first systems,</p>
<p>552<br>00:28:54,240 –&gt; 00:28:57,240<br>they had this tight coupling between the logical layer,</p>
<p>553<br>00:28:57,240 –&gt; 00:29:00,240<br>like the schema, what entities that I have,</p>
<p>554<br>00:29:00,240 –&gt; 00:29:04,240<br>what are their attributes, and then a physical layer in the system.</p>
<p>555<br>00:29:04,240 –&gt; 00:29:07,240<br>Meaning how is actually being represented on disk or in memory,</p>
<p>556<br>00:29:07,240 –&gt; 00:29:10,240<br>and how would I actually interact with them.</p>
<p>557<br>00:29:10,240 –&gt; 00:29:11,240<br>Right?</p>
<p>558<br>00:29:11,240 –&gt; 00:29:14,240<br>And so what happens is if you were a programmer at the time,</p>
<p>559<br>00:29:14,240 –&gt; 00:29:16,240<br>and you wanted to use one of these database systems,</p>
<p>560<br>00:29:16,240 –&gt; 00:29:20,240<br>you had to know exactly how the database is restoring your database.</p>
<p>561<br>00:29:20,240 –&gt; 00:29:22,240<br>And so that, because that would expose a different API to you</p>
<p>562<br>00:29:22,240 –&gt; 00:29:24,240<br>to interact with it.</p>
<p>563<br>00:29:24,240 –&gt; 00:29:27,240<br>Well, IMS, you could store the data as either as a hash table</p>
<p>564<br>00:29:27,240 –&gt; 00:29:29,240<br>or a B plus tree or tree structure.</p>
<p>565<br>00:29:29,240 –&gt; 00:29:32,240<br>And then you got different APIs because,</p>
<p>566<br>00:29:32,240 –&gt; 00:29:34,240<br>depending on which data structure we’re using,</p>
<p>567<br>00:29:34,240 –&gt; 00:29:37,240<br>because hash tables you can’t do scans.</p>
<p>568<br>00:29:37,240 –&gt; 00:29:41,240<br>Right? But in tree structures.</p>
<p>569<br>00:29:41,240 –&gt; 00:29:43,240<br>So now the problem with this is that,</p>
<p>570<br>00:29:43,240 –&gt; 00:29:45,240<br>any single time I made it,</p>
<p>571<br>00:29:45,240 –&gt; 00:29:48,240<br>I want to make a change to the schema at both the logical layer</p>
<p>572<br>00:29:48,240 –&gt; 00:29:51,240<br>and the physical layer, I had to go rewrite my application,</p>
<p>573<br>00:29:51,240 –&gt; 00:29:55,240<br>almost scratch, because all how the database was represented</p>
<p>574<br>00:29:55,240 –&gt; 00:29:57,240<br>on disk changed.</p>
<p>575<br>00:29:57,240 –&gt; 00:29:59,240<br>So other issues with the data model,</p>
<p>576<br>00:29:59,240 –&gt; 00:30:01,240<br>we don’t need to really go.</p>
<p>577<br>00:30:01,240 –&gt; 00:30:04,240<br>Basically, like in the higher click model,</p>
<p>578<br>00:30:04,240 –&gt; 00:30:08,240<br>you had to sort of have these four loops traverse one collection</p>
<p>579<br>00:30:08,240 –&gt; 00:30:10,240<br>for some other collection.</p>
<p>580<br>00:30:10,240 –&gt; 00:30:16,240<br>It was really inefficient way to interact with the data system.</p>
<p>581<br>00:30:16,240 –&gt; 00:30:18,240<br>What happened was in the late 1960s,</p>
<p>582<br>00:30:18,240 –&gt; 00:30:20,240<br>there was this guy Ted Codd,</p>
<p>583<br>00:30:20,240 –&gt; 00:30:26,240<br>who was pen, who was a user.</p>
<p>584<br>00:30:26,240 –&gt; 00:30:30,240<br>And he was walking up in New York with the big ladders,</p>
<p>585<br>00:30:30,240 –&gt; 00:30:35,240<br>and he saw all these IBM developers primarily working on,</p>
<p>586<br>00:30:35,240 –&gt; 00:30:39,240<br>saw them rewriting the database applications over and over again,</p>
<p>587<br>00:30:39,240 –&gt; 00:30:41,240<br>every single time there was a schema change,</p>
<p>588<br>00:30:41,240 –&gt; 00:30:44,240<br>every single time there was a physical layout change.</p>
<p>589<br>00:30:44,240 –&gt; 00:30:46,240<br>Right?</p>
<p>590<br>00:30:46,240 –&gt; 00:30:48,240<br>And the humans were rapidly.</p>
<p>591<br>00:30:48,240 –&gt; 00:30:50,240<br>So people were like,</p>
<p>592<br>00:30:50,240 –&gt; 00:30:52,240<br>okay, we’re just more humans at the problem,</p>
<p>593<br>00:30:52,240 –&gt; 00:30:56,240<br>and that’s better than buying a…</p>
<p>594<br>00:30:56,240 –&gt; 00:30:59,240<br>So my ex-album, he pointed out,</p>
<p>595<br>00:30:59,240 –&gt; 00:31:02,240<br>embedded in my app.</p>
<p>596<br>00:31:02,240 –&gt; 00:31:04,240<br>It’s all a game problem.</p>
<p>597<br>00:31:04,240 –&gt; 00:31:06,240<br>Well, think of it now.</p>
<p>598<br>00:31:06,240 –&gt; 00:31:09,240<br>That was like the idea.</p>
<p>599<br>00:31:09,240 –&gt; 00:31:11,240<br>I had to go rewrite.</p>
<p>600<br>00:31:11,240 –&gt; 00:31:13,240<br>I meant the all.</p>
<p>601<br>00:31:13,240 –&gt; 00:31:15,240<br>I had to try to be an example,</p>
<p>602<br>00:31:15,240 –&gt; 00:31:18,240<br>but that was the kind of shit they were doing back in the day.</p>
<p>603<br>00:31:18,240 –&gt; 00:31:20,240<br>So Codd’s all, as Ted says,</p>
<p>604<br>00:31:20,240 –&gt; 00:31:22,240<br>he’s got to be a better way.</p>
<p>605<br>00:31:22,240 –&gt; 00:31:25,240<br>And he’s a model,</p>
<p>606<br>00:31:25,240 –&gt; 00:31:30,240<br>as an abstract and how to represent a database,</p>
<p>607<br>00:31:30,240 –&gt; 00:31:35,240<br>and the relationships between entities in a database,</p>
<p>608<br>00:31:35,240 –&gt; 00:31:39,240<br>and avoid having the tight coupling between physical layer</p>
<p>609<br>00:31:39,240 –&gt; 00:31:41,240<br>and the logical layer.</p>
<p>610<br>00:31:41,240 –&gt; 00:31:44,240<br>Meaning, if we define it in mathematical terms,</p>
<p>611<br>00:31:44,240 –&gt; 00:31:45,240<br>I had these relations,</p>
<p>612<br>00:31:45,240 –&gt; 00:31:46,240<br>here’s the manipulations or changes,</p>
<p>613<br>00:31:46,240 –&gt; 00:31:47,240<br>or lookups I can do on them,</p>
<p>614<br>00:31:47,240 –&gt; 00:31:48,240<br>and I don’t know,</p>
<p>615<br>00:31:48,240 –&gt; 00:31:51,240<br>how the database system underneath the covers is actually going to store it.</p>
<p>616<br>00:31:51,240 –&gt; 00:31:53,240<br>Because the database system knows what the data is,</p>
<p>617<br>00:31:53,240 –&gt; 00:31:54,240<br>knows what the queries are.</p>
<p>618<br>00:31:54,240 –&gt; 00:31:57,240<br>It can be a better position to decide how to…</p>
<p>619<br>00:31:57,240 –&gt; 00:32:00,240<br>When could.</p>
<p>620<br>00:32:00,240 –&gt; 00:32:04,240<br>So I just proposed the relational data model in 19…</p>
<p>621<br>00:32:04,240 –&gt; 00:32:05,240<br>There’s this…</p>
<p>622<br>00:32:05,240 –&gt; 00:32:07,240<br>It’s tech report paper.</p>
<p>623<br>00:32:07,240 –&gt; 00:32:09,240<br>That’s not…</p>
<p>624<br>00:32:09,240 –&gt; 00:32:12,240<br>I think…</p>
<p>625<br>00:32:12,240 –&gt; 00:32:15,240<br>I think…</p>
<p>626<br>00:32:15,240 –&gt; 00:32:17,240<br>That…</p>
<p>627<br>00:32:17,240 –&gt; 00:32:19,240<br>Again, mathematician.</p>
<p>628<br>00:32:19,240 –&gt; 00:32:21,240<br>He didn’t define programming language,</p>
<p>629<br>00:32:21,240 –&gt; 00:32:24,240<br>so he’s not saying how you actually implement this.</p>
<p>630<br>00:32:24,240 –&gt; 00:32:27,240<br>He’s just defining what relations are,</p>
<p>631<br>00:32:27,240 –&gt; 00:32:30,240<br>and the algebra to manipulate them.</p>
<p>632<br>00:32:30,240 –&gt; 00:32:32,240<br>Right?</p>
<p>633<br>00:32:32,240 –&gt; 00:32:36,240<br>So there’s three key tenets of…</p>
<p>634<br>00:32:36,240 –&gt; 00:32:40,240<br>These are the three ones that we’re going to care about the most.</p>
<p>635<br>00:32:40,240 –&gt; 00:32:44,240<br>So the first is that we’ll store all our collection of data</p>
<p>636<br>00:32:44,240 –&gt; 00:32:46,240<br>in simple data structures.</p>
<p>637<br>00:32:46,240 –&gt; 00:32:48,240<br>For the nation.</p>
<p>638<br>00:32:48,240 –&gt; 00:32:50,240<br>I’m just going to say that’s the mathematical term.</p>
<p>639<br>00:32:50,240 –&gt; 00:32:52,240<br>Same thing as the table.</p>
<p>640<br>00:32:52,240 –&gt; 00:32:54,240<br>If we’re coming from the Mongo World, they call it a collection.</p>
<p>641<br>00:32:54,240 –&gt; 00:32:56,240<br>It’s the same idea.</p>
<p>642<br>00:32:56,240 –&gt; 00:32:58,240<br>All these are simple data structures.</p>
<p>643<br>00:32:58,240 –&gt; 00:33:02,240<br>I need to worry about all the member types that all these other data…</p>
<p>644<br>00:33:02,240 –&gt; 00:33:08,240<br>Second is that you’re going to keep the physical representation of the database</p>
<p>645<br>00:33:08,240 –&gt; 00:33:12,240<br>itself, like the actual bits and bytes on disk or in memory.</p>
<p>646<br>00:33:12,240 –&gt; 00:33:14,240<br>You’re going to leave that…</p>
<p>647<br>00:33:14,240 –&gt; 00:33:16,240<br>You’re not going to…</p>
<p>648<br>00:33:16,240 –&gt; 00:33:18,240<br>In your relational data model.</p>
<p>649<br>00:33:18,240 –&gt; 00:33:21,240<br>Leave that for the data system to figure out what’s the best way to do it.</p>
<p>650<br>00:33:21,240 –&gt; 00:33:24,240<br>Because the idea now is that if I store the data in one way,</p>
<p>651<br>00:33:24,240 –&gt; 00:33:27,240<br>but then as I see, we’re kind of putting data and putting in…</p>
<p>652<br>00:33:27,240 –&gt; 00:33:29,240<br>What kind of question is that?</p>
<p>653<br>00:33:29,240 –&gt; 00:33:32,240<br>Data system is saying, oh, I really want to store this on two machines</p>
<p>654<br>00:33:32,240 –&gt; 00:33:35,240<br>or two cells, or break it up in different ways, or sort it in one way.</p>
<p>655<br>00:33:35,240 –&gt; 00:33:38,240<br>And now, application doesn’t change,</p>
<p>656<br>00:33:38,240 –&gt; 00:33:41,240<br>because you’re just writing things queries at a high level,</p>
<p>657<br>00:33:41,240 –&gt; 00:33:45,240<br>and you don’t really care how certain it needs to cover.</p>
<p>658<br>00:33:45,240 –&gt; 00:33:46,240<br>Right?</p>
<p>659<br>00:33:46,240 –&gt; 00:33:47,240<br>And that’s the line out here.</p>
<p>660<br>00:33:47,240 –&gt; 00:33:49,240<br>You’re going to find at a high level…</p>
<p>661<br>00:33:49,240 –&gt; 00:33:51,240<br>You’re going to access data through a high level language,</p>
<p>662<br>00:33:51,240 –&gt; 00:33:55,240<br>and then let the data system figure out what’s the best way to…</p>
<p>663<br>00:33:55,240 –&gt; 00:33:57,240<br>To retrieve the data that you’re looking for,</p>
<p>664<br>00:33:57,240 –&gt; 00:34:00,240<br>or to do whatever operation you wanted to do.</p>
<p>665<br>00:34:00,240 –&gt; 00:34:03,240<br>So, cod won the Touring Word for this in 1981.</p>
<p>666<br>00:34:03,240 –&gt; 00:34:06,240<br>The site of Enicodosil, he won it in like 72,</p>
<p>667<br>00:34:06,240 –&gt; 00:34:09,239<br>but it took 10 years for people to realize he was wrong.</p>
<p>668<br>00:34:09,239 –&gt; 00:34:12,239<br>And then, he’s going to be Touring Words.</p>
<p>669<br>00:34:12,239 –&gt; 00:34:15,239<br>Odd is deaf, the code…</p>
<p>670<br>00:34:15,239 –&gt; 00:34:21,239<br>And then the other guy that won the Touring Word in Data…</p>
<p>671<br>00:34:21,239 –&gt; 00:34:24,239<br>Gray, he got lost in 2006,</p>
<p>672<br>00:34:24,239 –&gt; 00:34:26,239<br>and then the last…</p>
<p>673<br>00:34:26,239 –&gt; 00:34:28,239<br>Touring Word in Data, this is Mike Sturmberger,</p>
<p>674<br>00:34:28,239 –&gt; 00:34:32,239<br>and he’s post-credit, and was IPC advisor.</p>
<p>675<br>00:34:32,239 –&gt; 00:34:34,239<br>Well, covered Sturmberger…</p>
<p>676<br>00:34:34,239 –&gt; 00:34:37,239<br>So, there’s three key aspects of the digital data model.</p>
<p>677<br>00:34:37,239 –&gt; 00:34:41,239<br>There’s the structure, how we define what the data…</p>
<p>678<br>00:34:41,239 –&gt; 00:34:44,239<br>Data is actually is, what’s in our relations,</p>
<p>679<br>00:34:44,239 –&gt; 00:34:46,239<br>what are their attributes, and the types.</p>
<p>680<br>00:34:46,239 –&gt; 00:34:52,239<br>There’s the integrity methods, and specify what data is allowed to be stored in the database.</p>
<p>681<br>00:34:52,239 –&gt; 00:34:55,239<br>To make sure that every email address…</p>
<p>682<br>00:34:55,239 –&gt; 00:34:57,239<br>I don’t have many records without an email address,</p>
<p>683<br>00:34:57,239 –&gt; 00:35:04,239<br>or in my example, I can’t have an album that has an artist that doesn’t exist in the artist.</p>
<p>684<br>00:35:05,239 –&gt; 00:35:11,239<br>And then, the manipulation mechanisms allow us to find how we’re going to access the data and update it.</p>
<p>685<br>00:35:11,239 –&gt; 00:35:16,239<br>And the last one was what we talked about when we started talking about…</p>
<p>686<br>00:35:18,239 –&gt; 00:35:20,239<br>Math…</p>
<p>687<br>00:35:20,239 –&gt; 00:35:27,239<br>An on-order set of data that’s going to be the relationship of attributes that represent some entity in the real world.</p>
<p>688<br>00:35:27,239 –&gt; 00:35:31,239<br>So, the relation model doesn’t mean the relation between tables.</p>
<p>689<br>00:35:31,239 –&gt; 00:35:35,239<br>It’s really the relationship between attributes within…</p>
<p>690<br>00:35:35,239 –&gt; 00:35:42,239<br>So, again, a student has an email address, they have a phone number, a birthday, a home address,</p>
<p>691<br>00:35:42,239 –&gt; 00:35:43,239<br>right?</p>
<p>692<br>00:35:43,239 –&gt; 00:35:48,239<br>It’s that relation of those attributes combined together that represent some…</p>
<p>693<br>00:35:50,239 –&gt; 00:35:53,239<br>So, again, so we’ll have a set of attributes.</p>
<p>694<br>00:35:53,239 –&gt; 00:35:58,239<br>We’ll use the word Chippewl, but it also means record or row.</p>
<p>695<br>00:35:59,239 –&gt; 00:36:02,239<br>And then, at a high level, they all mean the same thing.</p>
<p>696<br>00:36:02,239 –&gt; 00:36:07,239<br>And so, for every single batch in the original…</p>
<p>697<br>00:36:07,239 –&gt; 00:36:12,239<br>original definition of the relation of data model, all the barriers have to be atomic or scalar.</p>
<p>698<br>00:36:12,239 –&gt; 00:36:15,239<br>But, again, as things have evolved over time,</p>
<p>699<br>00:36:19,239 –&gt; 00:36:22,239<br>again, Cod didn’t foresee these things back in the 70s.</p>
<p>700<br>00:36:22,239 –&gt; 00:36:25,239<br>This is the support of this today.</p>
<p>701<br>00:36:25,239 –&gt; 00:36:28,239<br>And of course, I’ll go for all of them to be there.</p>
<p>702<br>00:36:28,239 –&gt; 00:36:35,239<br>So, in some cases, some attributes could have a value that is null, meaning it’s unknown at the time.</p>
<p>703<br>00:36:35,239 –&gt; 00:36:40,239<br>And, again, you can specify in the schema what you want an attribute to support.</p>
<p>704<br>00:36:43,239 –&gt; 00:36:51,239<br>So, in every relation, there’s going to be a primary key that’s going to be used to uniquely identify a tuple.</p>
<p>705<br>00:36:51,239 –&gt; 00:36:56,239<br>Again, think of like your student ID or Android ID here at the university.</p>
<p>706<br>00:36:56,239 –&gt; 00:37:00,239<br>And that allows us to know exactly, you know,</p>
<p>707<br>00:37:00,239 –&gt; 00:37:03,239<br>a little record that we want.</p>
<p>708<br>00:37:03,239 –&gt; 00:37:05,239<br>Right, what we’re doing to…</p>
<p>709<br>00:37:05,239 –&gt; 00:37:08,239<br>Alright, example here…</p>
<p>710<br>00:37:08,239 –&gt; 00:37:17,239<br>Okay, a particular entry in our list.</p>
<p>711<br>00:37:17,239 –&gt; 00:37:28,239<br>But, again, your Android ID is unique.</p>
<p>712<br>00:37:28,239 –&gt; 00:37:32,239<br>And that would be a primary key for the university database.</p>
<p>713<br>00:37:33,239 –&gt; 00:37:42,239<br>What you can do in cases where you don’t have a primary key,</p>
<p>714<br>00:37:42,239 –&gt; 00:37:47,239<br>the identity column, the primary key.</p>
<p>715<br>00:37:47,239 –&gt; 00:37:53,239<br>You see this a lot in Orems, like Anger SQL, SQL, IZ, or using Node.js.</p>
<p>716<br>00:37:53,239 –&gt; 00:37:59,239<br>A lot of times, these frameworks will make these primary keys for you.</p>
<p>717<br>00:37:59,239 –&gt; 00:38:00,239<br>Right.</p>
<p>718<br>00:38:00,239 –&gt; 00:38:07,239<br>And so, the primary key is a constraint that the database management system will enforce for you on your relational data.</p>
<p>719<br>00:38:07,239 –&gt; 00:38:14,239<br>Make sure that, within any given relation, there does not exist a multiple records with the same primary key.</p>
<p>720<br>00:38:17,239 –&gt; 00:38:20,239<br>I talked about how to automatically identify columns throughout the semester.</p>
<p>721<br>00:38:20,239 –&gt; 00:38:26,239<br>But, there’s basically ways database management systems will congenrate these columns for you.</p>
<p>722<br>00:38:27,239 –&gt; 00:38:29,239<br>We’re calling foreign keys.</p>
<p>723<br>00:38:29,239 –&gt; 00:38:35,239<br>And this is to enforce a reference for integrity to make sure that if I have a…</p>
<p>724<br>00:38:35,239 –&gt; 00:38:40,239<br>In one relation, the first to another tuple in another relation,</p>
<p>725<br>00:38:40,239 –&gt; 00:38:46,239<br>that the database management system, you don’t have an orphan or a broken…</p>
<p>726<br>00:38:46,239 –&gt; 00:38:52,239<br>Because you delete the record from one row, still a dangly point in another row.</p>
<p>727<br>00:38:52,239 –&gt; 00:38:55,239<br>Going back here to our database…</p>
<p>728<br>00:39:07,239 –&gt; 00:39:09,239<br>In this tape…</p>
<p>729<br>00:39:09,239 –&gt; 00:39:12,239<br>But, let me say we have this next tape here.</p>
<p>730<br>00:39:12,239 –&gt; 00:39:15,239<br>We have a bunch of artists appear on it.</p>
<p>731<br>00:39:15,239 –&gt; 00:39:17,239<br>How do we actually…</p>
<p>732<br>00:39:18,239 –&gt; 00:39:19,239<br>On this mixed tape.</p>
<p>733<br>00:39:19,239 –&gt; 00:39:22,239<br>And I say, before a relational data, I’m going to explore the arrays,</p>
<p>734<br>00:39:22,239 –&gt; 00:39:24,239<br>at least the original version of it.</p>
<p>735<br>00:39:29,239 –&gt; 00:39:34,239<br>So, in the data model, if you do this, you would have a cross-reference table,</p>
<p>736<br>00:39:34,239 –&gt; 00:39:40,239<br>where you can keep track of the unique pairs of the relationships between the artists and the albums.</p>
<p>737<br>00:39:48,239 –&gt; 00:39:49,239<br>Right.</p>
<p>738<br>00:39:49,239 –&gt; 00:39:50,239<br>And now, again…</p>
<p>739<br>00:40:18,239 –&gt; 00:40:20,239<br>Again, it shows it for you.</p>
<p>740<br>00:40:20,239 –&gt; 00:40:23,239<br>So, you just write the same delete command, and…</p>
<p>741<br>00:40:23,239 –&gt; 00:40:25,239<br>The key is not all I’m going to do.</p>
<p>742<br>00:40:25,239 –&gt; 00:40:26,239<br>For you.</p>
<p>743<br>00:40:26,239 –&gt; 00:40:29,239<br>My script with Python code…</p>
<p>744<br>00:40:29,239 –&gt; 00:40:33,239<br>I’d have to do all that myself in my application code to follow those pointers,</p>
<p>745<br>00:40:33,239 –&gt; 00:40:36,239<br>to go find the things I’m looking for, to make sure that I don’t have these…</p>
<p>746<br>00:40:36,239 –&gt; 00:40:38,239<br>These dependencies.</p>
<p>747<br>00:40:40,239 –&gt; 00:40:42,239<br>To be the way you do this is…</p>
<p>748<br>00:40:43,239 –&gt; 00:40:45,239<br>To be the way you do this is…</p>
<p>749<br>00:41:01,239 –&gt; 00:41:02,239<br>So much…</p>
<p>750<br>00:41:05,239 –&gt; 00:41:07,239<br>Pro-Aiders, if you’re going to violate…</p>
<p>751<br>00:41:08,239 –&gt; 00:41:09,239<br>All right.</p>
<p>752<br>00:41:09,239 –&gt; 00:41:13,239<br>The last thing you can have, or call it, make strings…</p>
<p>753<br>00:41:13,239 –&gt; 00:41:18,239<br>are protection mechanisms that you can have the data system enforce to make sure that…</p>
<p>754<br>00:41:18,239 –&gt; 00:41:20,239<br>data follows the proper…</p>
<p>755<br>00:41:20,239 –&gt; 00:41:25,239<br>has values that conform to some kind of domain, or that you…</p>
<p>756<br>00:41:25,239 –&gt; 00:41:28,239<br>You don’t have values or tuples that…</p>
<p>757<br>00:41:28,239 –&gt; 00:41:31,239<br>make a screen and another thing.</p>
<p>758<br>00:41:31,239 –&gt; 00:41:36,239<br>The idea is that you can specify for a given attribute,</p>
<p>759<br>00:41:36,239 –&gt; 00:41:38,239<br>or within the global…</p>
<p>760<br>00:41:38,239 –&gt; 00:41:41,239<br>within a given attribute, or given table, or across multiple tables…</p>
<p>761<br>00:41:41,239 –&gt; 00:41:43,239<br>I can have…</p>
<p>762<br>00:41:43,239 –&gt; 00:41:47,239<br>Every single time I make a modification, or any of these constraints being violated…</p>
<p>763<br>00:41:47,239 –&gt; 00:41:51,239<br>If yes, then I throw an error, and I don’t let you make any changes.</p>
<p>764<br>00:41:51,239 –&gt; 00:41:54,239<br>So again, back to the example she brought up before,</p>
<p>765<br>00:41:54,239 –&gt; 00:41:59,239<br>what if someone writes a string character in your column for my C.A.E.P.A.</p>
<p>766<br>00:41:59,239 –&gt; 00:42:01,239<br>The data system will actually prevent you from doing that…</p>
<p>767<br>00:42:01,239 –&gt; 00:42:03,239<br>if you had these in Kenerger’s instance, because you would know…</p>
<p>768<br>00:42:03,239 –&gt; 00:42:05,239<br>Okay, you’re trying to sort something…</p>
<p>769<br>00:42:05,239 –&gt; 00:42:07,239<br>you’re trying to sort a character into an integer column…</p>
<p>770<br>00:42:07,239 –&gt; 00:42:10,239<br>I can’t let you do that in an error.</p>
<p>771<br>00:42:10,239 –&gt; 00:42:14,239<br>You can do other things like make sure that the year has been…</p>
<p>772<br>00:42:14,239 –&gt; 00:42:17,239<br>1900, a greater than zero.</p>
<p>773<br>00:42:17,239 –&gt; 00:42:20,239<br>All right, and the data system will enforce that for you.</p>
<p>774<br>00:42:20,239 –&gt; 00:42:23,239<br>The most common constraints that are out there…</p>
<p>775<br>00:42:23,239 –&gt; 00:42:27,239<br>things could happen for you…</p>
<p>776<br>00:42:27,239 –&gt; 00:42:30,239<br>or…</p>
<p>777<br>00:42:44,239 –&gt; 00:42:46,239<br>All right, and doesn’t let you make the change.</p>
<p>778<br>00:42:52,239 –&gt; 00:42:56,239<br>But again, we thought in our schema, and the racial data system will make sure that…</p>
<p>779<br>00:42:56,239 –&gt; 00:42:58,239<br>we’re going to enforce.</p>
<p>780<br>00:42:58,239 –&gt; 00:43:00,239<br>So now, matter if…</p>
<p>781<br>00:43:00,239 –&gt; 00:43:03,239<br>Python code, he’s general…</p>
<p>782<br>00:43:03,239 –&gt; 00:43:05,239<br>you have to start making changes…</p>
<p>783<br>00:43:05,239 –&gt; 00:43:07,239<br>you know, what’s going on in the database…</p>
<p>784<br>00:43:07,239 –&gt; 00:43:09,239<br>data system will prevent you from shooting yourself from the foot…</p>
<p>785<br>00:43:09,239 –&gt; 00:43:11,239<br>and making changes…</p>
<p>786<br>00:43:11,239 –&gt; 00:43:14,239<br>these constraints…</p>
<p>787<br>00:43:14,239 –&gt; 00:43:17,239<br>for…</p>
<p>788<br>00:43:19,239 –&gt; 00:43:22,239<br>All right, so now we’ve got to talk about how we actually want to enter into the database.</p>
<p>789<br>00:43:22,239 –&gt; 00:43:27,239<br>Right, assuming we set up the scheme, we define what our database and relations are going to look like…</p>
<p>790<br>00:43:27,239 –&gt; 00:43:31,239<br>we want to talk about how we actually want to…</p>
<p>791<br>00:43:31,239 –&gt; 00:43:33,239<br>to run queries on it.</p>
<p>792<br>00:43:33,239 –&gt; 00:43:36,239<br>So, at a high level, there’s two basic approaches to do this.</p>
<p>793<br>00:43:36,239 –&gt; 00:43:39,239<br>There’s the procedural and non-procedural languages.</p>
<p>794<br>00:43:39,239 –&gt; 00:43:43,239<br>So, the exact…</p>
<p>795<br>00:43:43,239 –&gt; 00:43:46,239<br>what the data system does…</p>
<p>796<br>00:43:46,239 –&gt; 00:43:49,239<br>whatever it is that you want to…</p>
<p>797<br>00:43:49,239 –&gt; 00:43:52,239<br>the…</p>
<p>798<br>00:43:52,239 –&gt; 00:43:55,239<br>a non-procedural one is where you would say,</p>
<p>799<br>00:43:55,239 –&gt; 00:43:57,239<br>here’s the answer I want you to compute.</p>
<p>800<br>00:43:57,239 –&gt; 00:44:01,239<br>I don’t know how to compute it, you figure it out.</p>
<p>801<br>00:44:01,239 –&gt; 00:44:04,239<br>So, relational…</p>
<p>802<br>00:44:04,239 –&gt; 00:44:09,239<br>and the SQL or relational calculus is going to be non-procedural, declarative.</p>
<p>803<br>00:44:09,239 –&gt; 00:44:11,239<br>We’re not going to cover relational calculus because you don’t…</p>
<p>804<br>00:44:11,239 –&gt; 00:44:13,239<br>you know what?</p>
<p>805<br>00:44:13,239 –&gt; 00:44:16,239<br>I’ve never used relational calculus in view.</p>
<p>806<br>00:44:16,239 –&gt; 00:44:18,239<br>Never.</p>
<p>807<br>00:44:18,239 –&gt; 00:44:20,239<br>All in the theory papers, which we’re not doing.</p>
<p>808<br>00:44:20,239 –&gt; 00:44:22,239<br>We don’t care about those.</p>
<p>809<br>00:44:22,239 –&gt; 00:44:23,239<br>But it is…</p>
<p>810<br>00:44:23,239 –&gt; 00:44:25,239<br>it is how it’s going to work.</p>
<p>811<br>00:44:25,239 –&gt; 00:44:29,239<br>If you’re baby-learning a query optimized relational calculus, but in the real world…</p>
<p>812<br>00:44:29,239 –&gt; 00:44:33,239<br>but relational algebra is not something you don’t think is a program.</p>
<p>813<br>00:44:33,239 –&gt; 00:44:39,239<br>But this is what we want to do to run queries and build execution engine,</p>
<p>814<br>00:44:39,239 –&gt; 00:44:41,239<br>all the things we do later on.</p>
<p>815<br>00:44:41,239 –&gt; 00:44:42,239<br>We want to…</p>
<p>816<br>00:44:42,239 –&gt; 00:44:44,239<br>relational algebra is at a high level and then…</p>
<p>817<br>00:44:44,239 –&gt; 00:44:45,239<br>over the…</p>
<p>818<br>00:44:45,239 –&gt; 00:44:51,239<br>the correct course of SQL is the modern variance of it.</p>
<p>819<br>00:44:51,239 –&gt; 00:44:54,239<br>All right, so the…</p>
<p>820<br>00:44:54,239 –&gt; 00:45:03,239<br>relational algebra in 1969, you also define the algebra that you would use to interact with the database system.</p>
<p>821<br>00:45:03,239 –&gt; 00:45:08,239<br>And it’s me way to extract data from it and…</p>
<p>822<br>00:45:08,239 –&gt; 00:45:11,239<br>and compute answers that you want.</p>
<p>823<br>00:45:11,239 –&gt; 00:45:15,239<br>So in the original paper, he defined seven fundamental operators.</p>
<p>824<br>00:45:15,239 –&gt; 00:45:16,239<br>It’s been…</p>
<p>825<br>00:45:16,239 –&gt; 00:45:17,239<br>additional…</p>
<p>826<br>00:45:17,239 –&gt; 00:45:20,239<br>additional operations you need in modern applications.</p>
<p>827<br>00:45:20,239 –&gt; 00:45:22,239<br>Like this doesn’t have sorting.</p>
<p>828<br>00:45:22,239 –&gt; 00:45:25,239<br>And obviously in the applications you need sorting, so that came later.</p>
<p>829<br>00:45:25,239 –&gt; 00:45:28,239<br>But all this is going to be based on…</p>
<p>830<br>00:45:28,239 –&gt; 00:45:30,239<br>on…</p>
<p>831<br>00:45:30,239 –&gt; 00:45:34,239<br>ordered lists of records or duplicates…</p>
<p>832<br>00:45:34,239 –&gt; 00:45:39,239<br>on order lists of tuples, but without any duplicates.</p>
<p>833<br>00:45:39,239 –&gt; 00:45:43,239<br>Now, what’s me slightly confusing is that in SQL, by default,</p>
<p>834<br>00:45:43,239 –&gt; 00:45:49,239<br>it’s going to try to use bag algebra, which is basically an unordered set that does have duplicates.</p>
<p>835<br>00:45:49,239 –&gt; 00:45:51,239<br>Or sometimes called a multi-set.</p>
<p>836<br>00:45:51,239 –&gt; 00:45:54,239<br>And the reason why SQL wants to use bags instead of sets,</p>
<p>837<br>00:45:54,239 –&gt; 00:45:55,239<br>because it’s actually…</p>
<p>838<br>00:45:55,239 –&gt; 00:45:58,239<br>you need more efficient if you don’t care about removing duplicates later on.</p>
<p>839<br>00:45:58,239 –&gt; 00:45:59,239<br>But in the…</p>
<p>840<br>00:45:59,239 –&gt; 00:46:03,239<br>algebra that we care about here, we assume we’re going to do duplicates.</p>
<p>841<br>00:46:03,239 –&gt; 00:46:07,239<br>So the basic idea of all these operators is that you’re going to take in some…</p>
<p>842<br>00:46:07,239 –&gt; 00:46:11,239<br>some relation as your input, or one or more relations as your inputs.</p>
<p>843<br>00:46:11,239 –&gt; 00:46:16,239<br>And then you’re going to do some operation on them, and then produce a new relation as the output.</p>
<p>844<br>00:46:16,239 –&gt; 00:46:18,239<br>And you can start changing all these…</p>
<p>845<br>00:46:18,239 –&gt; 00:46:22,239<br>these operators together to do more complex things.</p>
<p>846<br>00:46:22,239 –&gt; 00:46:25,239<br>So we’ll go through each of these one by one.</p>
<p>847<br>00:46:25,239 –&gt; 00:46:26,239<br>Animations aren’t working.</p>
<p>848<br>00:46:26,239 –&gt; 00:46:28,239<br>I don’t know why, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>849<br>00:46:28,239 –&gt; 00:46:31,239<br>Just showing everything all at once.</p>
<p>850<br>00:46:31,239 –&gt; 00:46:33,239<br>But…</p>
<p>851<br>00:46:38,239 –&gt; 00:46:42,239<br>The first thing you say is select, but I think the original paper calls that restrict.</p>
<p>852<br>00:46:42,239 –&gt; 00:46:44,239<br>The I-T-T thing, right?</p>
<p>853<br>00:46:44,239 –&gt; 00:46:47,239<br>But you’re trying to restrict the two-part etiquette.</p>
<p>854<br>00:46:47,239 –&gt; 00:46:52,239<br>And the idea in your select operator, you’re going to find first order of predicate logic</p>
<p>855<br>00:46:52,239 –&gt; 00:46:58,239<br>to specify what tuples will match with what other select operator is trying to do.</p>
<p>856<br>00:46:58,239 –&gt; 00:47:00,239<br>It’s a Boolean logic.</p>
<p>857<br>00:47:00,239 –&gt; 00:47:03,239<br>Like, it’s something equals something, or something less than something.</p>
<p>858<br>00:47:03,239 –&gt; 00:47:06,239<br>But you can have conjunctions and or disjunctions or…</p>
<p>859<br>00:47:06,239 –&gt; 00:47:08,239<br>Right.</p>
<p>860<br>00:47:36,239 –&gt; 00:47:43,239<br>Predicate the add down below…</p>
<p>861<br>00:47:43,239 –&gt; 00:47:50,239<br>on whatever your target table is.</p>
<p>862<br>00:47:50,239 –&gt; 00:47:53,239<br>Next operator is projection.</p>
<p>863<br>00:47:53,239 –&gt; 00:47:55,239<br>I’m not going to greet symbols for this one.</p>
<p>864<br>00:47:55,239 –&gt; 00:47:59,239<br>It’s easy to remember because it’s a low-py symbol for people to see.</p>
<p>865<br>00:47:59,239 –&gt; 00:48:06,239<br>And the idea here is your input and specify what you want to be in the output of the operator.</p>
<p>866<br>00:48:06,239 –&gt; 00:48:11,239<br>So you can rearrange the ordering of the attributes.</p>
<p>867<br>00:48:11,239 –&gt; 00:48:14,239<br>You can remove the attributes you don’t…</p>
<p>868<br>00:48:14,239 –&gt; 00:48:20,239<br>And then you can manipulate the values of the attributes to generate new drives.</p>
<p>869<br>00:48:20,239 –&gt; 00:48:26,239<br>And then you can manipulate the values of the attributes to generate new drives.</p>
<p>870<br>00:48:26,239 –&gt; 00:48:33,239<br>But it’s only operating on whatever…</p>
<p>871<br>00:48:33,239 –&gt; 00:48:38,239<br>That’s given to it.</p>
<p>872<br>00:48:38,239 –&gt; 00:49:07,239<br>So now we turn the operators of that…</p>
<p>873<br>00:49:07,239 –&gt; 00:49:14,239<br>that take multiple relations as their input.</p>
<p>874<br>00:49:14,239 –&gt; 00:49:17,239<br>So in the union operator, it’s a binary operator.</p>
<p>875<br>00:49:17,239 –&gt; 00:49:20,239<br>You can get an operation from set theory.</p>
<p>876<br>00:49:20,239 –&gt; 00:49:27,239<br>The general relation that contains all the symbols that either appear on one relations or both of relations.</p>
<p>877<br>00:49:27,239 –&gt; 00:49:30,239<br>So here, I take the…</p>
<p>878<br>00:49:38,239 –&gt; 00:49:44,239<br>The union clause.</p>
<p>879<br>00:49:44,239 –&gt; 00:49:47,239<br>So union will get…</p>
<p>880<br>00:49:47,239 –&gt; 00:49:50,239<br>And SQL will get rid of the duplicates.</p>
<p>881<br>00:49:50,239 –&gt; 00:49:56,239<br>If you want to keep the duplicates to make it run faster, you would add union all, A-L-L.</p>
<p>882<br>00:49:56,239 –&gt; 00:49:59,239<br>We won’t go over about that.</p>
<p>883<br>00:49:59,239 –&gt; 00:50:01,239<br>Just like union, we also have intersection.</p>
<p>884<br>00:50:01,239 –&gt; 00:50:02,239<br>Same thing.</p>
<p>885<br>00:50:02,239 –&gt; 00:50:04,239<br>We take the…</p>
<p>886<br>00:50:04,239 –&gt; 00:50:05,239<br>Take two…</p>
<p>887<br>00:50:05,239 –&gt; 00:50:06,239<br>Two…</p>
<p>888<br>00:50:06,239 –&gt; 00:50:07,239<br>And…</p>
<p>889<br>00:50:07,239 –&gt; 00:50:08,239<br>We…</p>
<p>890<br>00:50:08,239 –&gt; 00:50:12,239<br>We have to appear…</p>
<p>891<br>00:50:12,239 –&gt; 00:50:16,239<br>And it’s…</p>
<p>892<br>00:50:16,239 –&gt; 00:50:23,239<br>It’s to take all two relations and spit out all the ones that appear in the first one, but not the second one.</p>
<p>893<br>00:50:23,239 –&gt; 00:50:26,239<br>And SQL, you would use this with the…</p>
<p>894<br>00:50:26,239 –&gt; 00:50:29,239<br>This is basic set theory.</p>
<p>895<br>00:50:29,239 –&gt; 00:50:33,239<br>This is not anything that should be surprising anyone.</p>
<p>896<br>00:50:33,239 –&gt; 00:50:38,239<br>So any questions before we move on to the two important interesting things?</p>
<p>897<br>00:50:38,239 –&gt; 00:50:39,239<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>898<br>00:50:39,239 –&gt; 00:50:40,239<br>Well, this is…</p>
<p>899<br>00:50:40,239 –&gt; 00:50:46,239<br>In this case, the more relations have to be exactly the same and you have like the…</p>
<p>900<br>00:50:46,239 –&gt; 00:50:47,239<br>Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p>901<br>00:50:47,239 –&gt; 00:50:48,239<br>So, yes.</p>
<p>902<br>00:50:48,239 –&gt; 00:50:49,239<br>Question is…</p>
<p>903<br>00:50:49,239 –&gt; 00:50:50,239<br>Thank you for bringing this up.</p>
<p>904<br>00:50:50,239 –&gt; 00:50:55,239<br>Question is, in all these examples so far, do the two input relations have to have the exact same schema?</p>
<p>905<br>00:50:55,239 –&gt; 00:50:56,239<br>Yes.</p>
<p>906<br>00:50:56,239 –&gt; 00:50:57,239<br>So you…</p>
<p>907<br>00:50:57,239 –&gt; 00:50:58,239<br>Hold on to your user.</p>
<p>908<br>00:50:58,239 –&gt; 00:51:03,239<br>Yes.</p>
<p>909<br>00:51:03,239 –&gt; 00:51:10,239<br>Right.</p>
<p>910<br>00:51:10,239 –&gt; 00:51:12,239<br>So, the next…</p>
<p>911<br>00:51:12,239 –&gt; 00:51:13,239<br>So, we’re…</p>
<p>912<br>00:51:13,239 –&gt; 00:51:20,239<br>If we start looking at how to combine together the relations, and actually potentially look at what’s actually in the values of them.</p>
<p>913<br>00:51:20,239 –&gt; 00:51:23,239<br>So the first one we’re going to use is the…</p>
<p>914<br>00:51:23,239 –&gt; 00:51:26,239<br>Product operator…</p>
<p>915<br>00:51:26,239 –&gt; 00:51:29,239<br>Or in SQL, it’s called a cross-line.</p>
<p>916<br>00:51:29,239 –&gt; 00:51:33,239<br>The idea here is that you’re basically going to concatenate the…</p>
<p>917<br>00:51:33,239 –&gt; 00:51:34,239<br>The actual…</p>
<p>918<br>00:51:34,239 –&gt; 00:51:37,239<br>The first relation and the…</p>
<p>919<br>00:51:37,239 –&gt; 00:51:39,239<br>The two-pole…</p>
<p>920<br>00:51:39,239 –&gt; 00:51:40,239<br>Both.</p>
<p>921<br>00:51:40,239 –&gt; 00:51:44,239<br>And it’s for all unique combinations of two-poles from one relation and the other.</p>
<p>922<br>00:51:44,239 –&gt; 00:51:46,239<br>So you certainly think this is like two four-lips, right?</p>
<p>923<br>00:51:46,239 –&gt; 00:51:49,239<br>Where there’s four-lips spinning over R for every single…</p>
<p>924<br>00:51:49,239 –&gt; 00:51:52,239<br>In two-poles in R, you’re going to concatenate it with every single two-poles in S.</p>
<p>925<br>00:51:52,239 –&gt; 00:51:55,239<br>And you’re going to…</p>
<p>926<br>00:51:55,239 –&gt; 00:52:01,239<br>Of all…</p>
<p>927<br>00:52:01,239 –&gt; 00:52:12,239<br>Everything I guess, why this would actually…</p>
<p>928<br>00:52:12,239 –&gt; 00:52:17,239<br>Why would I actually want this?</p>
<p>929<br>00:52:17,239 –&gt; 00:52:23,039<br>I can think of testing.</p>
<p>930<br>00:52:23,039 –&gt; 00:52:27,159<br>If you’re trying to find all unique combinations of some two inputs to test some piece of software</p>
<p>931<br>00:52:27,159 –&gt; 00:52:34,639<br>or something, then you could use this.</p>
<p>932<br>00:52:34,639 –&gt; 00:52:38,159<br>But beyond that, as far as I know, there’s not widely used at all.</p>
<p>933<br>00:52:38,159 –&gt; 00:52:42,000<br>And oftentimes this shows up because you may take, like, you forgot a wear clause and you</p>
<p>934<br>00:52:42,000 –&gt; 00:52:43,000<br>get this by accident.</p>
<p>935<br>00:52:43,000 –&gt; 00:52:50,000<br>What do you mean, sorry?</p>
<p>936<br>00:52:50,000 –&gt; 00:52:53,000<br>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>937<br>00:52:53,000 –&gt; 00:52:58,840<br>Yeah, so the same is like an in-un table where they’re trying to, like, but that’s like for</p>
<p>938<br>00:52:58,840 –&gt; 00:52:59,840<br>inputs, right?</p>
<p>939<br>00:52:59,840 –&gt; 00:53:05,840<br>They’re trying to get all possible in-un as input to something.</p>
<p>940<br>00:53:05,840 –&gt; 00:53:06,840<br>All right.</p>
<p>941<br>00:53:06,840 –&gt; 00:53:14,720<br>The super useful is to do a joints.</p>
<p>942<br>00:53:14,720 –&gt; 00:53:22,920<br>And the idea here is that when you’re in a generic, and the combinations of the two input</p>
<p>943<br>00:53:22,920 –&gt; 00:53:26,760<br>relations will assume two for net, you know, it’s a binary operator.</p>
<p>944<br>00:53:26,760 –&gt; 00:53:30,960<br>There are multi-way joints where you can take multiple inputs, multiple relations.</p>
<p>945<br>00:53:30,960 –&gt; 00:53:32,680<br>We can ignore that for now.</p>
<p>946<br>00:53:32,679 –&gt; 00:53:38,119<br>You want to generate a new integer output that’s going to contain all the tuples that match</p>
<p>947<br>00:53:38,119 –&gt; 00:53:43,799<br>on the overlapping attributes in the first iteration and the overlapping attributes with the</p>
<p>948<br>00:53:43,799 –&gt; 00:53:44,799<br>second relation.</p>
<p>949<br>00:53:44,799 –&gt; 00:53:45,799<br>All right.</p>
<p>950<br>00:53:45,799 –&gt; 00:53:49,799<br>So different than the intersection.</p>
<p>951<br>00:53:49,799 –&gt; 00:53:56,480<br>The intersection has to have the exact- in this case here, I don’t have to- I want to</p>
<p>952<br>00:53:56,480 –&gt; 00:53:59,000<br>find the attributes where I do overlap.</p>
<p>953<br>00:53:59,000 –&gt; 00:54:25,000<br>I want to check that.</p>
<p>954<br>00:54:25,000 –&gt; 00:54:30,079<br>And so in my- in the original relation algebra here, you would actually- you don’t show the</p>
<p>955<br>00:54:30,079 –&gt; 00:54:40,679<br>duplicate columns, like the a.i.d from r and a.i.d from s.</p>
<p>956<br>00:54:40,679 –&gt; 00:54:44,320<br>So there’s a bunch of different ways to write this in SQL.</p>
<p>957<br>00:54:44,320 –&gt; 00:55:04,000<br>There’s a natural joint, or a keyword in SQL.</p>
<p>958<br>00:55:04,000 –&gt; 00:55:05,000<br>All right.</p>
<p>959<br>00:55:05,000 –&gt; 00:55:06,000<br>If you want to-</p>
<p>960<br>00:55:34,500 –&gt; 00:55:54,000<br>sitting somewhere, you just add a little more Python, then when it sessions something, when</p>
<p>961<br>00:55:54,000 –&gt; 00:56:03,039<br>it sessions you add more Python then.</p>
<p>962<br>00:56:03,039 –&gt; 00:56:09,039<br>would match with, for example, in this case, there’s only a change value for S.</p>
<p>963<br>00:56:09,039 –&gt; 00:56:15,039<br>So then with an absolute C like A, ID, D, A, and BOW, and then it’s part…</p>
<p>964<br>00:56:45,039 –&gt; 00:57:05,039<br>there’s a C external.</p>
<p>965<br>00:57:06,019 –&gt; 00:57:07,300<br>32</p>
<p>966<br>00:57:10,219 –&gt; 00:57:12,039<br>Wtf you are ascending</p>
<p>967<br>00:57:35,039 –&gt; 00:57:42,039<br>Both of them. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>968<br>00:58:05,039 –&gt; 00:58:28,300<br>Does Prince</p>
<p>969<br>00:58:58,300 –&gt; 00:59:08,420<br>So these are the ones that I showed you with the fundamental ones that Ted defined.</p>
<p>970<br>00:59:08,420 –&gt; 00:59:14,100<br>In the late 1970s, they got extended with a bunch of additional things and building real</p>
<p>971<br>00:59:14,100 –&gt; 00:59:19,220<br>applications, you need more than you do here in the original relational model, relational</p>
<p>972<br>00:59:19,220 –&gt; 00:59:20,220<br>algebra.</p>
<p>973<br>00:59:20,219 –&gt; 00:59:31,699<br>The renaming is like a projection of signing attributes to important duplicate emanate</p>
<p>974<br>00:59:31,699 –&gt; 00:59:38,699<br>elimination, distinct clauses, things like that.</p>
<p>975<br>00:59:38,699 –&gt; 00:59:45,699<br>I don’t know if I can find the count access.</p>
<p>976<br>00:59:45,699 –&gt; 00:59:56,699<br>I used a teacher, we don’t teach anymore because you never find it.</p>
<p>977<br>00:59:56,699 –&gt; 01:00:04,219<br>Especially the divisions, the way to find the two-pollion run relation that matches all</p>
<p>978<br>01:00:04,219 –&gt; 01:00:07,980<br>two-polls in another relation.</p>
<p>979<br>01:00:07,980 –&gt; 01:00:08,980<br>It doesn’t appear in the real world.</p>
<p>980<br>01:00:08,980 –&gt; 01:00:09,980<br>It’s not common.</p>
<p>981<br>01:00:09,980 –&gt; 01:00:11,980<br>We don’t want to worry about it.</p>
<p>982<br>01:00:11,980 –&gt; 01:00:18,659<br>The bottom line again, the core of every relational database system is we built on these algebra</p>
<p>983<br>01:00:18,659 –&gt; 01:00:27,179<br>and then we can define a round of these sort of roles that allow us to support very expressive</p>
<p>984<br>01:00:27,179 –&gt; 01:00:32,179<br>and complex SQL queries.</p>
<p>985<br>01:00:32,179 –&gt; 01:00:39,179<br>That’s what we need.</p>
<p>986<br>01:00:39,179 –&gt; 01:00:47,179<br>You can find a duplicate elimination on things of the primary key.</p>
<p>987<br>01:00:47,179 –&gt; 01:01:08,179<br>The relation, query, still sort of a piece of software that the system actually executed.</p>
<p>988<br>01:01:08,179 –&gt; 01:01:15,179<br>So one order versus another.</p>
<p>989<br>01:01:15,179 –&gt; 01:01:18,179<br>So say I do a query where there’s the Sb.</p>
<p>990<br>01:01:38,179 –&gt; 01:02:03,179<br>I’m going to build two-pollion two-polls together, one-pollion two-polls together right away.</p>
<p>991<br>01:02:03,179 –&gt; 01:02:10,179<br>So I’m going to write you out for your show of specifying how you want the data system to execute things.</p>
<p>992<br>01:02:10,179 –&gt; 01:02:13,179<br>So a better approach, and this is the motivation for the course, is that we want to tell the database system that</p>
<p>993<br>01:02:13,179 –&gt; 01:02:15,179<br>here’s the answer we want.</p>
<p>994<br>01:02:15,179 –&gt; 01:02:18,179<br>We don’t know how, we don’t care how you actually want to trust.</p>
<p>995<br>01:02:18,179 –&gt; 01:02:20,179<br>This is what we want you to do for us.</p>
<p>996<br>01:02:20,179 –&gt; 01:02:24,179<br>So that’s what I’m specifying the exact algebra steps I want to compute.</p>
<p>997<br>01:02:24,179 –&gt; 01:02:32,179<br>Hey, retrieve the two-polls from RNS, and find me all those where the ID.</p>
<p>998<br>01:02:32,179 –&gt; 01:02:47,179<br>And then now the data system can take into account how the data being stored, what kind of where things are actually physically located, what the CPU can support, what kind of CPU do I have, do I have a GPU, do I have an FPGA, do I have other things.</p>
<p>999<br>01:02:47,179 –&gt; 01:02:55,179<br>All of that can be in its decision for how to execute the query one way versus the other.</p>
<p>1000<br>01:02:56,179 –&gt; 01:03:14,179<br>And now, again, think of like if I’m a developer, I can write a bunch of code in my laptop, write some SQL on my little test database, and then the same SQL statement will then work exactly the same, or it will produce the same correct result when I deploy in production on a giant machine that has a lot of memory.</p>
<p>1001<br>01:03:14,179 –&gt; 01:03:17,179<br>And I don’t have to change my application code.</p>
<p>1002<br>01:03:17,179 –&gt; 01:03:30,179<br>So that’s the beauty of the recipe, or why you’re going to want a declarative language, but the core concept of how that declarative language is going to work is being predicated on relational algebra.</p>
<p>1003<br>01:03:30,179 –&gt; 01:03:37,179<br>Right? So SQL is going to be the factor of standard as we’ll discuss.</p>
<p>1004<br>01:03:48,179 –&gt; 01:03:52,179<br>Okay?</p>
<p>1005<br>01:03:52,179 –&gt; 01:03:53,179<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1006<br>01:03:54,179 –&gt; 01:03:55,179<br>Perfect.</p>
<p>1007<br>01:03:58,179 –&gt; 01:04:00,179<br>Click before we go. I want to talk about all the data models.</p>
<p>1008<br>01:04:00,179 –&gt; 01:04:03,179<br>So.</p>
<p>1009<br>01:04:07,179 –&gt; 01:04:11,179<br>I.</p>
<p>1010<br>01:04:11,179 –&gt; 01:04:14,179<br>And it calls vector databases is the hot thing on hacker news.</p>
<p>1011<br>01:04:14,179 –&gt; 01:04:16,179<br>It’s worth discussing what they actually are.</p>
<p>1012<br>01:04:16,179 –&gt; 01:04:22,179<br>So you guys understand why it’s all bullshit, you see it in the real world.</p>
<p>1013<br>01:04:22,179 –&gt; 01:04:24,739<br>So the document data model is old.</p>
<p>1014<br>01:04:24,739 –&gt; 01:04:26,980<br>So MongoDB came out in 2008.</p>
<p>1015<br>01:04:26,980 –&gt; 01:04:28,059<br>It’s all this groundbreaking.</p>
<p>1016<br>01:04:28,059 –&gt; 01:04:29,619<br>We’re storing things as JSON.</p>
<p>1017<br>01:04:29,619 –&gt; 01:04:32,619<br>But the ideas go back to the 1980s.</p>
<p>1018<br>01:04:32,619 –&gt; 01:04:34,859<br>Early 1990s, there were object data.</p>
<p>1019<br>01:04:34,859 –&gt; 01:04:36,940<br>Object oriented program was a high thing.</p>
<p>1020<br>01:04:36,940 –&gt; 01:04:38,940<br>So people said rather than storing things of relations,</p>
<p>1021<br>01:04:38,940 –&gt; 01:04:41,379<br>we want to store things as objects.</p>
<p>1022<br>01:04:41,379 –&gt; 01:04:43,659<br>And then they had these sort of specialized programming languages</p>
<p>1023<br>01:04:43,659 –&gt; 01:04:47,219<br>that knew how to write code in your office.</p>
<p>1024<br>01:04:47,219 –&gt; 01:04:53,939<br>It’s like a, it would database system.</p>
<p>1025<br>01:04:53,939 –&gt; 01:04:57,339<br>But those, basically, those objects are the same thing as JSON.</p>
<p>1026<br>01:04:57,339 –&gt; 01:04:58,379<br>They’re the same thing as XML.</p>
<p>1027<br>01:04:58,379 –&gt; 01:05:01,019<br>XML databases were the hot thing and 90,000s.</p>
<p>1028<br>01:05:01,019 –&gt; 01:05:04,339<br>So at high level, all of them are equivalent.</p>
<p>1029<br>01:05:04,339 –&gt; 01:05:10,819<br>So the data structure, we have these named fields.</p>
<p>1030<br>01:05:10,819 –&gt; 01:05:16,379<br>And the values of the name field can be an array, a scalar type,</p>
<p>1031<br>01:05:16,380 –&gt; 01:05:19,539<br>and so forth.</p>
<p>1032<br>01:05:19,539 –&gt; 01:05:22,220<br>And again, all the modern systems use JSON.</p>
<p>1033<br>01:05:22,220 –&gt; 01:05:26,140<br>So now the reason why these document data systems exist</p>
<p>1034<br>01:05:26,140 –&gt; 01:05:30,980<br>is this problem that comes up called the relationship object</p>
<p>1035<br>01:05:30,980 –&gt; 01:05:32,980<br>impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>1036<br>01:05:32,980 –&gt; 01:05:36,940<br>That’s the problem of if I break my data up</p>
<p>1037<br>01:05:36,940 –&gt; 01:05:40,619<br>in these different relations, but I write my application code</p>
<p>1038<br>01:05:40,619 –&gt; 01:05:44,180<br>in Python or whatever, in objects, now</p>
<p>1039<br>01:05:44,179 –&gt; 01:05:46,099<br>when I want to go retrieve data from the data,</p>
<p>1040<br>01:05:46,099 –&gt; 01:05:50,659<br>it’s a bunch of joins, tits together the form that I</p>
<p>1041<br>01:05:50,659 –&gt; 01:05:52,659<br>want to operate on my application.</p>
<p>1042<br>01:05:52,659 –&gt; 01:05:56,539<br>But the data is once a layer or separate.</p>
<p>1043<br>01:05:56,539 –&gt; 01:06:07,739<br>And so the, and I would argue, yeah, for some things,</p>
<p>1044<br>01:06:07,739 –&gt; 01:06:08,859<br>that makes sense.</p>
<p>1045<br>01:06:08,859 –&gt; 01:06:10,739<br>But for other things, it’s actually a bad idea,</p>
<p>1046<br>01:06:10,739 –&gt; 01:06:13,219<br>because now you’re going to have a bunch of duplicate data.</p>
<p>1047<br>01:06:13,219 –&gt; 01:06:14,699<br>You have all the problems you saw before where</p>
<p>1048<br>01:06:14,699 –&gt; 01:06:17,739<br>I’ve got to make sure that if I change something that’s</p>
<p>1049<br>01:06:17,739 –&gt; 01:06:20,859<br>duplicated in a file or in my database,</p>
<p>1050<br>01:06:20,859 –&gt; 01:06:22,219<br>I make the changes all over the place.</p>
<p>1051<br>01:06:26,219 –&gt; 01:06:32,539<br>So we go back to our example before of the BG.</p>
<p>1052<br>01:06:32,539 –&gt; 01:06:34,019<br>The high data I’ll have to research.</p>
<p>1053<br>01:06:36,980 –&gt; 01:06:39,939<br>So if I have an object that wants to get for a given artist,</p>
<p>1054<br>01:06:39,939 –&gt; 01:06:42,019<br>here’s all the albums that they appear on.</p>
<p>1055<br>01:06:42,019 –&gt; 01:06:56,019<br>Right? Now, you can do this in a single single state member, but you know, it’s not perfect,</p>
<p>1056<br>01:06:56,019 –&gt; 01:07:04,019<br>but there’s ways to do it. So, the dogman deities people say, you don’t need this guy here,</p>
<p>1057<br>01:07:04,019 –&gt; 01:07:07,019<br>you get this. And if you’re application code, is it</p>
<p>1058<br>01:07:07,019 –&gt; 01:07:10,019<br>code, is it?</p>
<p>1059<br>01:07:27,019 –&gt; 01:07:32,019<br>The same promise before, like, if I, if I’m an artist appearing on the same album,</p>
<p>1060<br>01:07:32,019 –&gt; 01:07:36,019<br>I could have duplicate entries in all their JSON documents. If I make updates,</p>
<p>1061<br>01:07:36,019 –&gt; 01:07:40,019<br>I’m going to make sure I change all of them. So,</p>
<p>1062<br>01:07:48,019 –&gt; 01:07:50,019<br>and so, natively,</p>
<p>1063<br>01:07:56,019 –&gt; 01:08:01,019<br>so the interesting reflection point in the database marketplace where</p>
<p>1064<br>01:08:01,019 –&gt; 01:08:06,019<br>almost all the JSON databases that said, we don’t want to use SQL, we don’t want to use</p>
<p>1065<br>01:08:06,019 –&gt; 01:08:11,019<br>relational data model, a lot of them have basically converged and become more relational like.</p>
<p>1066<br>01:08:11,019 –&gt; 01:08:20,020<br>And you can run SQL on JSON. And so, over time, what we’re seeing is that the</p>
<p>1067<br>01:08:20,020 –&gt; 01:08:25,020<br>intellectual difference between document data and SQL databases and relational databases</p>
<p>1068<br>01:08:25,020 –&gt; 01:08:30,020<br>has shrunk. And now, basically, they’re all relational databases.</p>
<p>1069<br>01:08:30,020 –&gt; 01:08:36,020<br>Mongo was last hold up. Mongo added support for SQL in 2021, right? But for years,</p>
<p>1070<br>01:08:36,020 –&gt; 01:08:40,020<br>because we know the founders are like, oh, we’re never going to support SQL, they do.</p>
<p>1071<br>01:08:40,020 –&gt; 01:08:45,020<br>And then get the other, they also support JSON. So, I would</p>
<p>1072<br>01:08:45,020 –&gt; 01:08:51,020<br>go to an alternate database that is contorting and stuff, look like a relational database when you just</p>
<p>1073<br>01:08:51,020 –&gt; 01:08:56,020<br>have a database, plus press.</p>
<p>1074<br>01:08:56,020 –&gt; 01:09:00,020<br>So, they’re in the news because obviously,</p>
<p>1075<br>01:09:00,020 –&gt; 01:09:06,020<br>check, if you tease the hot thing, and so, the way to think about this now is like</p>
<p>1076<br>01:09:06,020 –&gt; 01:09:11,020<br>when pure building web applications 10, 15 years ago, everything was always JSON,</p>
<p>1077<br>01:09:11,020 –&gt; 01:09:16,020<br>they’re fine, you need a JSON database. And that’s how the new SQL system is going to start.</p>
<p>1078<br>01:09:16,020 –&gt; 01:09:22,020<br>Now, it’s like, okay, well, I have all these vectors I’m going to come back from my</p>
<p>1079<br>01:09:22,020 –&gt; 01:09:26,020<br>former HTTPT or whatever I’m using, and sort of that in a database that can</p>
<p>1080<br>01:09:26,020 –&gt; 01:09:33,020<br>natively store vectors. So, I can do, but I would argue that these systems,</p>
<p>1081<br>01:09:33,020 –&gt; 01:09:37,020<br>they’re basically, they’re, they’re, they’re limited to functionality, and over time,</p>
<p>1082<br>01:09:37,020 –&gt; 01:09:40,020<br>they’re basically going to have to morph to a relational database.</p>
<p>1083<br>01:09:40,020 –&gt; 01:09:43,020<br>So, the vector data model vector is just a</p>
<p>1084<br>01:09:43,020 –&gt; 01:09:49,020<br>array that, and in this approach here with these systems, it’s a one-dimensional</p>
<p>1085<br>01:09:49,020 –&gt; 01:09:54,020<br>array of floating point numbers. And the systems for the</p>
<p>1086<br>01:09:54,020 –&gt; 01:09:58,020<br>neighbor search, either exact or proximate,</p>
<p>1087<br>01:09:58,020 –&gt; 01:10:02,020<br>allow you to semantic search over your data. So, in all my predictors I share before,</p>
<p>1088<br>01:10:02,020 –&gt; 01:10:07,020<br>it’s like AID equals two, AID equals 102, whatever, exact matches.</p>
<p>1089<br>01:10:07,020 –&gt; 01:10:11,020<br>This, with these vectors allow you to embed somehow,</p>
<p>1090<br>01:10:11,020 –&gt; 01:10:16,020<br>magically through, through, through Transformers, the deeper meaning of what your</p>
<p>1091<br>01:10:16,020 –&gt; 01:10:19,020<br>data actually looks like. So, you can ask high-level questions like, hey, show me,</p>
<p>1092<br>01:10:19,020 –&gt; 01:10:24,020<br>you know, show me, show me how to relate to this. You know, show me,</p>
<p>1093<br>01:10:24,020 –&gt; 01:10:28,020<br>you know, show me, show me, show me how to relate to this.</p>
<p>1094<br>01:10:28,020 –&gt; 01:10:31,020<br>Instead of doing exact matches for the keyword CMU, I would, I would,</p>
<p>1095<br>01:10:31,020 –&gt; 01:10:35,020<br>I could learn things like, oh, Shum,</p>
<p>1096<br>01:10:35,020 –&gt; 01:10:39,020<br>talk about a diversity in Pittsburgh, that was fan of by,</p>
<p>1097<br>01:10:39,020 –&gt; 01:10:45,020<br>like, can learn things about, that are implicit in the data,</p>
<p>1098<br>01:10:45,020 –&gt; 01:10:48,020<br>I then do exact lookups. Yes.</p>
<p>1099<br>01:10:48,020 –&gt; 01:10:51,020<br>What’s the difference between graph data and vector data?</p>
<p>1100<br>01:10:51,020 –&gt; 01:10:54,020<br>Question is, what’s interesting, graph data bases and vector data bases?</p>
<p>1101<br>01:10:54,020 –&gt; 01:10:57,020<br>Let’s take that one off of mine. That’s different. But,</p>
<p>1102<br>01:10:57,020 –&gt; 01:11:00,020<br>vector’s literate is one, like, one-dimensional arrays.</p>
<p>1103<br>01:11:00,020 –&gt; 01:11:03,020<br>Graph data bases are storing the relationship between objects, like edges and</p>
<p>1104<br>01:11:03,020 –&gt; 01:11:06,020<br>nodes and things like that. If you’re looking at one degree from the current</p>
<p>1105<br>01:11:06,020 –&gt; 01:11:09,020<br>node, it sounds like it’s similar.</p>
<p>1106<br>01:11:09,020 –&gt; 01:11:12,020<br>It’s statement, if you’re looking at one degree from the current node,</p>
<p>1107<br>01:11:12,020 –&gt; 01:11:15,020<br>it sounds like it’s similar. But, like,</p>
<p>1108<br>01:11:15,020 –&gt; 01:11:19,020<br>but, like, the, how to say this? In a graph data base, you’re,</p>
<p>1109<br>01:11:19,020 –&gt; 01:11:23,020<br>you’re explicitly storing the, that structure and your traversing it to find</p>
<p>1110<br>01:11:23,020 –&gt; 01:11:27,020<br>things that you’re looking for. This is like, I’m encoding as a vector,</p>
<p>1111<br>01:11:27,020 –&gt; 01:11:31,020<br>and I don’t know what the vector is actually representing.</p>
<p>1112<br>01:11:32,020 –&gt; 01:11:35,020<br>So, pi and current is pi, hot one, a bunch of</p>
<p>1113<br>01:11:35,020 –&gt; 01:11:40,020<br>things that I’m going to give a talk about two years ago.</p>
<p>1114<br>01:11:40,020 –&gt; 01:11:43,020<br>I’m going to give a talk about this two years ago.</p>
<p>1115<br>01:11:43,020 –&gt; 01:11:49,020<br>It’s under two weeks. So, if you want to learn more of this,</p>
<p>1116<br>01:11:49,020 –&gt; 01:11:53,020<br>check it out. At their core, all these vector data bases are just going to be</p>
<p>1117<br>01:11:53,020 –&gt; 01:11:58,020<br>a index that allow you to do nearest neighbor search.</p>
<p>1118<br>01:11:59,020 –&gt; 01:12:01,020<br>So, it looks like this.</p>
<p>1119<br>01:12:01,020 –&gt; 01:12:04,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1120<br>01:12:05,020 –&gt; 01:12:08,020<br>that’s the problem.</p>
<p>1121<br>01:12:08,020 –&gt; 01:12:11,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1122<br>01:12:11,020 –&gt; 01:12:15,020<br>I’m going to give a talk about this.</p>
<p>1123<br>01:12:15,020 –&gt; 01:12:18,020<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1124<br>01:12:18,020 –&gt; 01:12:22,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1125<br>01:12:22,020 –&gt; 01:12:25,020<br>you’re going to give a talk about this.</p>
<p>1126<br>01:12:25,020 –&gt; 01:12:27,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1127<br>01:12:27,020 –&gt; 01:12:30,020<br>you’re going to give a talk about this.</p>
<p>1128<br>01:12:30,020 –&gt; 01:12:33,020<br>The neighbor never figured out. We don’t know what it is.</p>
<p>1129<br>01:13:01,020 –&gt; 01:13:06,020<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1130<br>01:13:06,020 –&gt; 01:13:09,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1131<br>01:13:09,020 –&gt; 01:13:14,020<br>you’re going to give a talk about this.</p>
<p>1132<br>01:13:15,020 –&gt; 01:13:21,020<br>That’s the core at a super high level of what a vector</p>
<p>1133<br>01:13:21,020 –&gt; 01:13:25,020<br>is doing.</p>
<p>1134<br>01:13:26,020 –&gt; 01:13:29,020<br>The question, is this similar to relational calculus?</p>
<p>1135<br>01:13:29,020 –&gt; 01:13:32,020<br>What is? So, we’re part of this.</p>
<p>1136<br>01:13:32,020 –&gt; 01:13:35,020<br>Wait.</p>
<p>1137<br>01:13:56,020 –&gt; 01:14:02,020<br>What?</p>
<p>1138<br>01:14:02,020 –&gt; 01:14:07,020<br>I was trying to get it in the middle.</p>
<p>1139<br>01:14:07,020 –&gt; 01:14:12,020<br>They care about that.</p>
<p>1140<br>01:14:12,020 –&gt; 01:14:16,020<br>They care about that.</p>
<p>1141<br>01:14:16,020 –&gt; 01:14:19,020<br>I was trying to get it in the middle.</p>
<p>1142<br>01:14:19,020 –&gt; 01:14:21,020<br>They care about that.</p>
<p>1143<br>01:14:22,020 –&gt; 01:14:24,020<br>So,</p>
<p>1144<br>01:14:24,020 –&gt; 01:14:28,020<br>I would argue</p>
<p>1145<br>01:14:28,020 –&gt; 01:14:33,020<br>the core of these vector is R is just this.</p>
<p>1146<br>01:14:52,020 –&gt; 01:14:54,020<br>No.</p>
<p>1147<br>01:14:54,020 –&gt; 01:14:57,020<br>Right. You can do a bunch of relational database.</p>
<p>1148<br>01:14:57,020 –&gt; 01:15:00,020<br>They all added this.</p>
<p>1149<br>01:15:00,020 –&gt; 01:15:02,020<br>Because,</p>
<p>1150<br>01:15:02,020 –&gt; 01:15:05,020<br>PG vector,</p>
<p>1151<br>01:15:05,020 –&gt; 01:15:08,020<br>single store, click house,</p>
<p>1152<br>01:15:08,020 –&gt; 01:15:11,020<br>beyond all the data that we need to report this.</p>
<p>1153<br>01:15:11,020 –&gt; 01:15:13,020<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1154<br>01:15:13,020 –&gt; 01:15:16,020<br>I just want to explain to you.</p>
<p>1155<br>01:15:16,020 –&gt; 01:15:18,020<br>So, database is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>1156<br>01:15:19,020 –&gt; 01:15:23,020<br>And then relational algebra will be the core fun of</p>
<p>1157<br>01:15:23,020 –&gt; 01:15:25,020<br>doing these interactions.</p>
<p>1158<br>01:15:25,020 –&gt; 01:15:28,020<br>And then that will define how we want to build the component of our system</p>
<p>1159<br>01:15:28,020 –&gt; 01:15:31,020<br>to run queries.</p>
<p>1160<br>01:15:31,020 –&gt; 01:15:32,020<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1161<br>01:15:32,020 –&gt; 01:15:34,020<br>So, when this class will be on C4,</p>
<p>1162<br>01:15:34,020 –&gt; 01:15:37,020<br>Project 0 is out. Please start it now.</p>
<p>1163<br>01:15:37,020 –&gt; 01:15:39,020<br>It’s due the 11th.</p>
<p>1164<br>01:15:39,020 –&gt; 01:15:42,020<br>And then homework 1 will be out.</p>
<p>1165<br>01:15:42,020 –&gt; 01:15:43,020<br>Here.</p>
