                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:11,759<br>Okay, good afternoon. Good evening or good night or good morning. Whatever time you’re</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:11,759 –&gt; 00:00:19,480<br>in and watching this lecture. Just double checking on the south. People can hear me.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:19,480 –&gt; 00:00:27,080<br>Yes. Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:27,079 –&gt; 00:00:32,320<br>Okay. I’m going to talk about two things today. I want to finish our discussion</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:32,320 –&gt; 00:00:38,599<br>on the farm and then I’ll talk about Spark. Just to remind everybody else or</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:38,599 –&gt; 00:00:43,320<br>everybody where we were in the farm, we talked about executing a</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:43,320 –&gt; 00:00:48,519<br>transaction without any failures and we looked at one example of whether</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:48,519 –&gt; 00:00:53,079<br>actually the transaction provided external consistency or</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:53,079 –&gt; 00:00:59,600<br>your strict serializability. I want to talk about one more example to look</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:59,600 –&gt; 00:01:05,079<br>about serializability and then talk a little bit about fault holds. But before</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:05,079 –&gt; 00:01:11,719<br>doing so, it’s probably helpful to remind ourselves exactly how a transaction</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:11,719 –&gt; 00:01:17,599<br>works if there are no failures. In farm and application goes for two phases,</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:17,599 –&gt; 00:01:24,039<br>the execution phase where it fetches objects from different shards and then</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:24,039 –&gt; 00:01:30,000<br>the commit phase. We move back at this picture here. There’s an execution phase</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:30,000 –&gt; 00:01:40,479<br>three occupants are being read. One for each different chart. We have</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:40,479 –&gt; 00:01:45,519<br>chart one, chart two and chart three and every chart has one backup. This system</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:45,519 –&gt; 00:01:51,560<br>can tolerate one failure. So the object to read, the two objects are being</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:51,560 –&gt; 00:01:57,719<br>modified as we’ve seen in the second and then once the free</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:57,719 –&gt; 00:02:01,640<br>object to read and to be modified, the application might decide to commit and</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:01,640 –&gt; 00:02:07,599<br>then the whole commit phase goes into action. This whole story from steps one through</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:07,599 –&gt; 00:02:14,039<br>five. In step one, the transaction takes out locks on the objects that have</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:14,039 –&gt; 00:02:19,039<br>been written written. We see here there have been two objects that have been</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:19,039 –&gt; 00:02:23,959<br>written to abide the transaction and so we’re propagating what’s called lock</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:23,959 –&gt; 00:02:31,840<br>records to every primary. Every primary is going to have a lock record for</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:31,840 –&gt; 00:02:38,759<br>this transaction and for the objects involved in that transaction. The lock</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:38,759 –&gt; 00:02:43,479<br>records contains an object ID which identifies the object uniquely</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:43,479 –&gt; 00:02:50,599<br>a version number. So at the time that the transaction reads an object, it gets</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:50,599 –&gt; 00:02:56,359<br>back a version number. In fact, it gets back this 64 bit number which is</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:56,359 –&gt; 00:03:06,120<br>top is a lock bit and the rest is the version number. And then a new value.</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:06,120 –&gt; 00:03:13,599<br>So you know primary one and primary two is going to have primary one is going to</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:13,599 –&gt; 00:03:17,039<br>have the lock record for object one. Primary two is going to have the lock object</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:17,039 –&gt; 00:03:21,800<br>for primary before object two. Then there’s a separate phase for the</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:21,800 –&gt; 00:03:27,200<br>validation of the read-only operations or operations object that have only</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:27,200 –&gt; 00:03:32,120<br>been read but not modified. And as we can see in those in this validation step,</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:32,120 –&gt; 00:03:42,920<br>the dotted lines represent one sided RDMAs. And as we talked about on Tuesday,</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:42,920 –&gt; 00:03:48,319<br>those basically involve no server involvement. The sender can just read an</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:48,319 –&gt; 00:03:52,759<br>object out of the memory of the server. We’ve actually had, we’ve had</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:52,759 –&gt; 00:03:55,719<br>actually having to interrupt the computation that’s actually running on the</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:55,719 –&gt; 00:04:01,240<br>server. So they take it very fast. Unlike these operations that we saw here,</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:01,240 –&gt; 00:04:05,159<br>which are actually right RDMAs.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:07,240 –&gt; 00:04:11,080<br>The cool two in the sense that you get the right to the</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:11,080 –&gt; 00:04:15,520<br>append through this log record without actually interrupting the server, but the</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:15,520 –&gt; 00:04:20,160<br>server actually has to process these log records and the server in this case,</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:20,160 –&gt; 00:04:24,199<br>once it actually process one of these log records, it tries to take out the</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:24,199 –&gt; 00:04:28,199<br>lock. If it succeeds trying to take the lock, the version number hasn’t changed</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:28,199 –&gt; 00:04:33,159<br>or the lock bit or no other transaction is taking the lock, then it will reply</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:33,159 –&gt; 00:04:40,279<br>back, you know, uses another one of right RDMAs saying okay. And so, you know, we see</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:40,279 –&gt; 00:04:45,000<br>that on the acquiring the lock requires action on the server, but the one</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:45,000 –&gt; 00:04:50,199<br>sided RDMAs who reads validation doesn’t require any action on the server.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:50,199 –&gt; 00:04:57,879<br>Then there’s the, if everything turns out to be okay, so the transaction is</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:57,879 –&gt; 00:05:03,719<br>basically able to obtain all those right locks and validate the read operations.</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:03,719 –&gt; 00:05:11,079<br>It actually makes the decision to commit and to commit it first communicates to</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:11,079 –&gt; 00:05:22,120<br>every backup. The change. So, it’s a commit backup record.</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:22,120 –&gt; 00:05:31,800<br>And it depends that to every, to the backups of the objects that have been modified.</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:31,800 –&gt; 00:05:35,879<br>And again, you know, it’s basically copy of the lock record, you know,</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:35,879 –&gt; 00:05:39,160<br>the ID goes in there, the version number goes in there, and the new value.</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:39,160 –&gt; 00:05:49,879<br>Once, you know, all the backwats, you know, have reported that they actually have a copy of the object.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:49,879 –&gt; 00:05:53,800<br>Now, we’re basically in pretty good shape, correct, because the primary has a copy,</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:53,800 –&gt; 00:05:58,120<br>the backup has a copy, except the primary, you don’t really know if the transaction has been</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:58,120 –&gt; 00:06:05,159<br>committed yet or not. And so, a final step is that actually the, the coordinator,</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:05,159 –&gt; 00:06:10,680<br>or the detection coordinator, writes out the commit record and commit primary record.</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:10,680 –&gt; 00:06:22,519<br>Informing the primary that actually the transaction actually has committed.</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:23,480 –&gt; 00:06:27,000<br>And as soon as it gets an acknowledgement from one of the nicks, you know,</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:27,000 –&gt; 00:06:32,920<br>indicated by the dotted lines, it actually reports back to the application saying that the</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:32,920 –&gt; 00:06:33,879<br>transaction commit.</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:33,879 –&gt; 00:06:40,680<br>So, what we want to do now is look at two cases.</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:40,680 –&gt; 00:06:44,279<br>One, we want to talk a little bit more about the serialized ability,</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:44,279 –&gt; 00:06:47,719<br>just to see if the concurrency control worked out, and then we’ll talk a little bit about fault</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:47,719 –&gt; 00:06:49,639<br>tolerance and see if the fault tolerance story works out.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:51,639 –&gt; 00:06:55,319<br>So, let me first start with serialized ability.</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:56,439 –&gt; 00:06:58,759<br>Or actually, maybe before doing that, let me just ask if,</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:59,719 –&gt; 00:07:03,399<br>if there’s any questions, you know, so far, or in what everybody sort of has swapped,</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:04,360 –&gt; 00:07:08,360<br>successfully swapped, far and back into, into your memories.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:12,199 –&gt; 00:07:16,120<br>What does the rectangle mean in this picture?</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:16,759 –&gt; 00:07:19,959<br>So, what’s the rectangle? What does it signify?</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:19,959 –&gt; 00:07:20,519<br>A long gap?</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:20,519 –&gt; 00:07:21,159<br>Oh, it’s an object.</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:22,039 –&gt; 00:07:23,159<br>Oh, it’s an object, okay.</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:26,120 –&gt; 00:07:28,279<br>Okay. Any other questions?</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:29,319 –&gt; 00:07:39,240<br>Okay. Good. Let’s, so let’s look at the correctness from the concurrency perspective.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:40,279 –&gt; 00:07:43,480<br>So, the correctness correctness straight serialized ability.</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:49,240 –&gt; 00:07:56,439<br>And on Tuesday, we looked at a transaction that didn’t really involve a right validation,</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:56,439 –&gt; 00:08:00,680<br>because there was no object that was ret, but not written.</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:00,680 –&gt; 00:08:03,480<br>And so, I’m going to look at another transaction this time around where actually</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:03,480 –&gt; 00:08:05,000<br>the validation phase plays a role.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:05,639 –&gt; 00:08:07,160<br>And so, I’m going to look at two transactions.</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:08,360 –&gt; 00:08:13,000<br>And this is sort of, this example is a classic example to test</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:13,879 –&gt; 00:08:16,600<br>whether a protocol provides your serialized ability or not.</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:16,600 –&gt; 00:08:20,279<br>Of course, it’s not going to be approved, but it’s sort of one of the key examples that</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:20,279 –&gt; 00:08:24,120<br>generally is very helpful to see, to understand, whether how the protocol works.</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:24,759 –&gt; 00:08:28,920<br>So, the protocol, the transactions are if x is zero, then we’re going to say,</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:28,920 –&gt; 00:08:29,720<br>y to one.</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:30,439 –&gt; 00:08:33,879<br>So, if object x is zero, we’ll say, object y to one,</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:33,879 –&gt; 00:08:36,200<br>which is acting to the sort of the opposite.</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:36,679 –&gt; 00:08:41,799<br>It looks if y is zero, and if y is zero, we’ll set x to one.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:43,960 –&gt; 00:08:47,879<br>And the reason that these, sort of, this is a good test for serialized ability</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:48,759 –&gt; 00:08:53,480<br>is that either transaction one should go after two to correct, or two to go after t1.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:54,440 –&gt; 00:08:59,000<br>And depending on which order you run, either y is one or x is one,</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:59,000 –&gt; 00:09:03,960<br>but you never should have, you never should have the outcome, so x is one,</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:05,159 –&gt; 00:09:09,639<br>but x is one, and y is one.</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:11,480 –&gt; 00:09:15,080<br>And that should not be a lot because nothing would be definitely violates your</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:15,080 –&gt; 00:09:17,000<br>serialized ability. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:22,520 –&gt; 00:09:24,920<br>Okay, so what we want to do is you know, test whether</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:26,520 –&gt; 00:09:31,320<br>pharma actually is successful, or we want to understand where pharma,</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:31,320 –&gt; 00:09:36,680<br>and indeed it is not possible that x is one and y is one get produced.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:37,240 –&gt; 00:09:38,920<br>So, let’s look at the timeline.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:39,480 –&gt; 00:09:42,520<br>Let’s say we have t1, we have t2,</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:43,480 –&gt; 00:09:47,960<br>there’s the timeline, so they both, you know,</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:47,960 –&gt; 00:09:51,879<br>in their sort of preparation or an execution phase, they both reach objects, so</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:52,679 –&gt; 00:09:55,799<br>let’s say they run true to concurrency, we do a read of x,</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:55,799 –&gt; 00:10:00,600<br>get a version of zero, we do a read of y, version of zero, same here.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:04,279 –&gt; 00:10:09,079<br>And of course, in t1, we’ll update y, t2, we’ll update x,</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:09,639 –&gt; 00:10:13,879<br>and they base at some point, you know, both starts to the commit phase.</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:19,400 –&gt; 00:10:26,600<br>And you know, let’s, so let’s say the t1 start first and basically grabs the, you know,</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:26,600 –&gt; 00:10:34,440<br>it needs the lock on y, since it’s going to be writing y, so let’s say it successfully</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:34,440 –&gt; 00:10:39,000<br>grabs the log and y, and so that actually will set, you know, the log bit,</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:39,000 –&gt; 00:10:42,760<br>you know, great, in the version number of the y object.</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:44,920 –&gt; 00:10:48,440<br>And then, you know, let’s say, you know, actually, since it’s going to read,</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:48,440 –&gt; 00:10:53,800<br>as has red x, but it’s not, it’s has a red x, but it is not modifying x,</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:53,800 –&gt; 00:10:55,240<br>you know, it’s going to be a validation of x,</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:55,240 –&gt; 00:10:59,480<br>you know, x was read in version number zero,</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:59,480 –&gt; 00:11:06,519<br>the, you know, a validation phase, you know, nothing extra nice, change, yes, with x,</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:06,519 –&gt; 00:11:11,080<br>so the that version number still zero there, and we run executed in this order.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:11,080 –&gt; 00:11:16,600<br>And so, you know, things are sort of, are fine, and it, you know, at some point, you know,</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:16,600 –&gt; 00:11:24,120<br>this transaction might commit. So let’s look at t2, and let’s say, you know, t2,</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:24,120 –&gt; 00:11:35,000<br>runs after the validation of x, so it grabs the log, and then, you know, the,</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:35,000 –&gt; 00:11:41,399<br>it has red y, so it needs to do a validation of y. So it’s going to do a validation of y,</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:42,120 –&gt; 00:11:47,080<br>and the question is, is that validation could succeed or not?</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:47,080 –&gt; 00:11:56,440<br>No, because the previous, the other operation has a log and modified the value,</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:56,440 –&gt; 00:12:01,080<br>so it’s not the same that was originally red. Yeah, so the, the version number might mean</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:01,080 –&gt; 00:12:05,639<br>they’re still the same, but the y, you know, for you one x has set the log bit, right,</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:05,639 –&gt; 00:12:09,240<br>for the object of y, and so at this point, this validation will fail,</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:10,840 –&gt; 00:12:15,960<br>because it’s not the same, or the log bit has been set, and so to t2,</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:15,960 –&gt; 00:12:21,240<br>transaction, the t2 transaction will abort. Okay, so that makes sense?</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:22,920 –&gt; 00:12:28,440<br>So we see at least in this particular example that, you know, it is the case that t1 and t2</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:28,440 –&gt; 00:12:35,960<br>both don’t commit, which would result in this incorrect outcome. Any questions about this?</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:35,960 –&gt; 00:12:46,280<br>I had a question. Yeah. Yeah, so, like for the transactions,</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:46,759 –&gt; 00:12:51,480<br>so these are like, these have to be like update transactions, like, like,</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:51,480 –&gt; 00:12:58,040<br>like, right, correct? I can always read. It could do it. Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>140<br>00:12:58,840 –&gt; 00:13:04,759<br>I just wonder if they were like, read operations, you could do that, like, log free, right?</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:04,919 –&gt; 00:13:09,240<br>And as long as the… Yeah, so this is actually good. Let’s go back to this picture here,</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:09,240 –&gt; 00:13:13,879<br>correct? Then let’s look at the, let’s say there were no rights involved in this transaction at all,</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:13,879 –&gt; 00:13:17,080<br>correct? Like so, for example, the two obvious that are being read, correct, or stored at,</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:17,799 –&gt; 00:13:23,559<br>p1 and p2. So let’s assume that these guys are actually not involved, so those objects</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:23,559 –&gt; 00:13:27,480<br>were not written, so that the only operation that’s happening is a read of that object.</p>
<p>146<br>00:13:28,039 –&gt; 00:13:34,200<br>And if you see in, and so the protocol is carefully designed, so that if you only do read,</p>
<p>147<br>00:13:34,759 –&gt; 00:13:41,399<br>you only do one sided RDMAs, correct? Here in the execution phase, and then one RDC day to do</p>
<p>148<br>00:13:41,399 –&gt; 00:13:48,439<br>the validation. And no locks are taken out, no rights are being done, no records are being</p>
<p>149<br>00:13:48,439 –&gt; 00:13:55,639<br>appended. That’s the only thing that happens. And so this is one of the cool features about farm</p>
<p>150<br>00:13:55,639 –&gt; 00:14:04,439<br>is that these transactions that only do read can be executed without, with only one sided RDMAs,</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:04,919 –&gt; 00:14:13,319<br>and only, with no rights to any locks or grabbing any locks. And so that’s why one reason that they</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:13,319 –&gt; 00:14:19,960<br>get extremely high performance. And this is also the reason why, for example, the lock phase,</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:19,960 –&gt; 00:14:25,799<br>the lock step, and the validation steps are two separate things, because in for read-only</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:25,799 –&gt; 00:14:34,519<br>transactions, there’s no lock step. Okay? Actually, I’ll turn on that.</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:35,480 –&gt; 00:14:42,279<br>For read-only transactions, why do we need the second value, why do we need the validation phase?</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:42,279 –&gt; 00:14:46,279<br>Because aren’t you like reading a value, and then you’re immediately validating right after it,</p>
<p>157<br>00:14:46,279 –&gt; 00:14:52,200<br>like the version? It seems like… There could be another transaction that has been modified the object,</p>
<p>158<br>00:14:52,200 –&gt; 00:15:00,279<br>yeah? So if an transaction ran or started and committed before… Okay, a concurrent transaction</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:00,279 –&gt; 00:15:06,600<br>that’s your rights might modify the object. And I’ll be back, right? So the</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:09,799 –&gt; 00:15:15,639<br>intersection that writes, then the transaction that actually follows it, you know, should,</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:15,639 –&gt; 00:15:21,959<br>you know, see observed that last right. But if the, correct the same time, then we can reorder them</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:21,959 –&gt; 00:15:27,559<br>either way. Yeah, exactly at the same time, we can order, reorder, reorder them, yeah.</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:30,759 –&gt; 00:15:37,319<br>So it still seems to me like the second validation, because the first time you read it,</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:37,319 –&gt; 00:15:42,279<br>the second time you just immediately ping and see if the version is the same. It still seems to me</p>
<p>165<br>00:15:42,279 –&gt; 00:15:48,839<br>like the second validation is like almost unnecessary. You might be right, I haven’t found</p>
<p>166<br>00:15:48,839 –&gt; 00:15:55,240<br>it very hard about this, that there… If there are transactions, there are only read-only</p>
<p>167<br>00:15:55,240 –&gt; 00:15:59,079<br>transactions, you know, then the validation is undoubtedly not necessary. I haven’t very</p>
<p>168<br>00:15:59,080 –&gt; 00:16:03,320<br>carefully thought about like when there’s a mix of transactions, where there’s a case where you need</p>
<p>169<br>00:16:03,320 –&gt; 00:16:09,320<br>the validation. Yeah, what did that be the case where like you have, like if you read a value,</p>
<p>170<br>00:16:10,600 –&gt; 00:16:15,480<br>like you respect to read like two values atonemently, you read a value, after you read a value,</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:15,480 –&gt; 00:16:22,280<br>like some transaction modifies the other value. Yeah, that’d be really one of the possibilities.</p>
<p>172<br>00:16:22,919 –&gt; 00:16:32,360<br>Yeah. Yeah, actually, I’m not quite sure actually, in that case, that’s a problem.</p>
<p>173<br>00:16:33,240 –&gt; 00:16:37,159<br>Like in, for example, in this case, you know, this T1 and T2 case, it’s not really crucial,</p>
<p>174<br>00:16:37,159 –&gt; 00:16:43,000<br>but why actually does the validation, correct? Even though actually that’s an injection,</p>
<p>175<br>00:16:43,799 –&gt; 00:16:46,759<br>T1 only reads why.</p>
<p>176<br>00:16:49,720 –&gt; 00:16:59,000<br>Right? What is transaction 2 was just x equals 1 instead of like without that statement.</p>
<p>177<br>00:16:59,000 –&gt; 00:17:00,120<br>And a blind right?</p>
<p>178<br>00:17:03,000 –&gt; 00:17:08,759<br>If it’s just a blind right. Yeah, it’s just x equals 1 and then it executes after the validation</p>
<p>179<br>00:17:08,759 –&gt; 00:17:12,119<br>of T1. Yeah, that’s fine, correct?</p>
<p>180<br>00:17:19,559 –&gt; 00:17:21,720<br>But we didn’t end up not sure what the question is.</p>
<p>181<br>00:17:23,160 –&gt; 00:17:30,279<br>If T2 is just like, you know, right x equals 1, within the validation step,</p>
<p>182<br>00:17:31,720 –&gt; 00:17:34,599<br>and it executes after the validation step of T1,</p>
<p>183<br>00:17:35,079 –&gt; 00:17:43,879<br>wouldn’t then XT1 think that X equals 0, but then X becomes 1 before the commit.</p>
<p>184<br>00:17:47,719 –&gt; 00:17:53,159<br>Okay, so let me maybe we can hold this up because I got to, you know, redraw the whole picture,</p>
<p>185<br>00:17:53,159 –&gt; 00:17:58,519<br>figure out exactly what the scenario you’re talking about. Okay, so maybe we can go back to this at the end.</p>
<p>186<br>00:17:59,480 –&gt; 00:18:05,720<br>So I had a question. What is the use case for a non-interaction?</p>
<p>187<br>00:18:10,759 –&gt; 00:18:16,599<br>If you think back at Spanner and this paper, like, there’s often the case in these workloads,</p>
<p>188<br>00:18:17,480 –&gt; 00:18:22,920<br>the TPC workload and the TACP workload where, you know, there’s a transaction that only does</p>
<p>189<br>00:18:22,920 –&gt; 00:18:28,120<br>reach, for example, I’ve composed the balances of a set of accounts. Nothing is being written,</p>
<p>190<br>00:18:28,120 –&gt; 00:18:30,680<br>but, you know, a lot of things, a lot of accounts are being read.</p>
<p>191<br>00:18:33,640 –&gt; 00:18:34,120<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>192<br>00:18:38,200 –&gt; 00:18:41,560<br>Okay, so we see here that there’s actually the validations that have faced is crucial, correct?</p>
<p>193<br>00:18:41,560 –&gt; 00:18:48,279<br>For this T1 and 2TK transaction, and furthermore that actually brings out work out correctly.</p>
<p>194<br>00:18:48,279 –&gt; 00:18:51,400<br>You know, we get strict share relies ability. Of course, this is not a proof, but it gives you,</p>
<p>195<br>00:18:52,360 –&gt; 00:18:57,240<br>you know, this example that sort of tried to get at the tricky case, you know, actually,</p>
<p>196<br>00:18:57,240 –&gt; 00:19:04,280<br>a farm seems to work out correctly. Okay, so that’s on the concurrency control.</p>
<p>197<br>00:19:05,560 –&gt; 00:19:09,240<br>Then the second part we want to talk a little bit about is fault tolerance.</p>
<p>198<br>00:19:11,560 –&gt; 00:19:20,360<br>And I’m not going to go with great amount of depth here. I just want to talk about the key challenge.</p>
<p>199<br>00:19:20,919 –&gt; 00:19:26,439<br>And see, you know, and build some intuition why we might actually be hopeful that</p>
<p>200<br>00:19:27,879 –&gt; 00:19:33,240<br>far and actually addresses that key challenge. And so the key challenge,</p>
<p>201<br>00:19:34,599 –&gt; 00:19:39,639<br>I think so maybe actually that the key challenge is that the transaction order crashes</p>
<p>202<br>00:19:43,719 –&gt; 00:19:46,519<br>after telling the application.</p>
<p>203<br>00:19:51,000 –&gt; 00:19:57,959<br>And then it has to be the case, right, that the transaction persists.</p>
<p>204<br>00:20:00,439 –&gt; 00:20:04,039<br>Because we’ve informed the application that the transaction is committed, so we can’t actually</p>
<p>205<br>00:20:04,039 –&gt; 00:20:10,759<br>lose, you know, any rights that the transaction has done. And so we can look at this picture again</p>
<p>206<br>00:20:12,199 –&gt; 00:20:15,399<br>and see if we’re going to be hopeful that it is the case.</p>
<p>207<br>00:20:21,319 –&gt; 00:20:28,039<br>So, you know, there are a couple of things to observe. After, you know, the lock phase,</p>
<p>208<br>00:20:29,479 –&gt; 00:20:36,119<br>it is the case that after the lock phase, it is the case that the two primaries,</p>
<p>209<br>00:20:36,119 –&gt; 00:20:45,879<br>Q1 and Q2 have a lock record, which describes the update. We don’t really know the transaction,</p>
<p>210<br>00:20:46,680 –&gt; 00:20:52,600<br>that record doesn’t say what the record actually, where did the transaction has committed,</p>
<p>211<br>00:20:52,600 –&gt; 00:20:58,520<br>but we have information about the transaction. Then after this step, the commit backup step,</p>
<p>212<br>00:20:59,160 –&gt; 00:21:06,280<br>now we know that you know, back up key want B1 and B2 have the commit record.</p>
<p>213<br>00:21:06,759 –&gt; 00:21:19,160<br>And then before, you know, the transaction, you know, the transaction coordinator reports to the</p>
<p>214<br>00:21:19,160 –&gt; 00:21:26,200<br>application that it has been successful, we know that one of the primaries, or let’s say P1,</p>
<p>215<br>00:21:26,200 –&gt; 00:21:27,399<br>also has to commit record.</p>
<p>216<br>00:21:28,120 –&gt; 00:21:38,200<br>So, you know, let’s assume there’s a crash, you know, like right here, so at that particular</p>
<p>217<br>00:21:38,200 –&gt; 00:21:43,480<br>just after that commit point, you know, and the system crashes. And what we want to convince ourselves</p>
<p>218<br>00:21:43,480 –&gt; 00:21:49,800<br>off is that if there’s one failure, you know, for each chart, you know, things actually work out</p>
<p>219<br>00:21:49,799 –&gt; 00:21:55,960<br>correct. And so the worsen case basically, correct, is that you know, B2 fails.</p>
<p>220<br>00:21:58,519 –&gt; 00:22:06,599<br>So, here where is B2? Here’s B2, B2 fails. And so we lose, you know, that commit record that</p>
<p>221<br>00:22:06,599 –&gt; 00:22:13,799<br>has actually there. The primary might actually have not a commit record yet, because it cracks after</p>
<p>222<br>00:22:13,799 –&gt; 00:22:19,079<br>we just see if the acknowledgement of one primary, so let’s say the P1 must actually have to commit</p>
<p>223<br>00:22:19,079 –&gt; 00:22:27,879<br>record. So in this case, P1 will have to commit record. And of course, you know, the backup has</p>
<p>224<br>00:22:27,879 –&gt; 00:22:33,799<br>a commit record for B1. And so this is enough information, correct, for to convince the</p>
<p>225<br>00:22:34,759 –&gt; 00:22:40,199<br>during recovery that actually the transaction has committed, because you know, we have a commit record,</p>
<p>226<br>00:22:40,199 –&gt; 00:22:45,079<br>you know, which is just what the TIG is that’s committed. And we actually have all the information</p>
<p>227<br>00:22:45,159 –&gt; 00:22:51,240<br>at the backups, namely the, the commit records, which describe the right transformations</p>
<p>228<br>00:22:52,599 –&gt; 00:22:57,000<br>on the backup. And so during recovery, we actually have enough information to decide, you know,</p>
<p>229<br>00:22:57,000 –&gt; 00:23:04,119<br>that the transaction actually has committed. And so that’s sufficient. Of course, there’s a complex</p>
<p>230<br>00:23:04,119 –&gt; 00:23:08,519<br>protocol that actually needs to go into action and sort of look at all the pieces that are left behind</p>
<p>231<br>00:23:08,519 –&gt; 00:23:12,439<br>by the transaction. But there are enough pieces left behind for the transaction for the coordinate,</p>
<p>232<br>00:23:12,440 –&gt; 00:23:18,120<br>for the sort of new coordinate or the recovery process to decide that some distance action indeed</p>
<p>233<br>00:23:18,120 –&gt; 00:23:22,759<br>has committed and should be persistent. Okay.</p>
<p>234<br>00:23:30,039 –&gt; 00:23:37,400<br>Good. So let me sort of summarize farm. And before we jump into the discussion of Spark.</p>
<p>235<br>00:23:38,360 –&gt; 00:23:46,280<br>So, you know, top level, you know, what it’s sort of cool about. So farm is just fast.</p>
<p>236<br>00:23:46,840 –&gt; 00:23:53,160<br>It can execute many, many, many transactions per second. There are some restrictions, of course,</p>
<p>237<br>00:23:53,160 –&gt; 00:24:04,759<br>you know, on farm. You can’t do it in all, all the time. So first of all, it assumes few</p>
<p>238<br>00:24:05,720 –&gt; 00:24:14,119<br>conflicts. So it uses this optimistic concurrency control scheme. And the reason that it uses this</p>
<p>239<br>00:24:14,119 –&gt; 00:24:17,480<br>optimistic concurrency control scheme because it wasn’t going to take out logs because it wants to do</p>
<p>240<br>00:24:17,480 –&gt; 00:24:23,000<br>these one sided R&amp;B and A’s without actually any server involvement. So it uses an optimistic</p>
<p>241<br>00:24:23,000 –&gt; 00:24:29,000<br>concurrency control control scheme. That means that if you want to get good performance and, you know,</p>
<p>242<br>00:24:29,000 –&gt; 00:24:34,200<br>avoid transaction boards, the workload better actually have few conflicts. And we see</p>
<p>243<br>00:24:34,200 –&gt; 00:24:38,120<br>new evaluation that there are sort of the two common benchmarks that are being used in the</p>
<p>244<br>00:24:38,120 –&gt; 00:24:44,920<br>transaction literature to do their system for those two benchmarks. Clearly, it’s doing extremely</p>
<p>245<br>00:24:44,920 –&gt; 00:24:51,240<br>well. This doesn’t mean there are not that many conflicts. The second assumption that makes is that</p>
<p>246<br>00:24:51,240 –&gt; 00:25:01,640<br>the data must fit in memory. So, it means that if you’re having really, really big database,</p>
<p>247<br>00:25:01,640 –&gt; 00:25:07,480<br>you have to buy more machines. Or if you really need a data to make and you don’t want to buy</p>
<p>248<br>00:25:07,480 –&gt; 00:25:11,560<br>more machines, then basically you can’t use farm. And you have to sort of go back to it for more</p>
<p>249<br>00:25:11,560 –&gt; 00:25:17,720<br>traditional data days that actually has an persistent storage. And so that you can read a write</p>
<p>250<br>00:25:19,240 –&gt; 00:25:25,640<br>records to a much larger storage device. Replication is only</p>
<p>251<br>00:25:25,640 –&gt; 00:25:40,280<br>within the data center. So in that way, in that way, expect respect is quite different from</p>
<p>252<br>00:25:41,000 –&gt; 00:25:45,160<br>Spanner. The whole goal there was to do synchronous transactions across synchronous</p>
<p>253<br>00:25:45,160 –&gt; 00:25:51,640<br>replication across data centers to support applications that need to be able to</p>
<p>254<br>00:25:51,640 –&gt; 00:25:58,600<br>survive or continue while some data centers are down indicates a farm that is just not the</p>
<p>255<br>00:25:58,600 –&gt; 00:26:07,160<br>kids. It’s not targeted to those kinds of applications. And then the final point is it requires</p>
<p>256<br>00:26:09,160 –&gt; 00:26:19,400<br>pretty fancy or exotic hardware, particularly in two things. This UPS, distributed UPS,</p>
<p>257<br>00:26:19,880 –&gt; 00:26:26,759<br>to survive complete data center outages. And more importantly, you know, uses this RDMA</p>
<p>258<br>00:26:27,480 –&gt; 00:26:30,360<br>Nix, you know, to get actually really high performance.</p>
<p>259<br>00:26:35,080 –&gt; 00:26:42,600<br>Okay, there’s sort of all I wanted to say about farm, unless there are any further questions.</p>
<p>260<br>00:26:49,560 –&gt; 00:27:04,280<br>Okay, so that basically ends our set of papers or just ends the sort of transaction side of the</p>
<p>261<br>00:27:05,240 –&gt; 00:27:13,320<br>this 824. So we’ve sort of done free lectures on transactions. And that’s basically the end</p>
<p>262<br>00:27:13,320 –&gt; 00:27:17,640<br>of talking about transactions. We’ll show up in other papers, but we’re not going to talk about</p>
<p>263<br>00:27:17,640 –&gt; 00:27:23,080<br>that in any more detail. And in fact, we’re basically sort of done with talking about, you know,</p>
<p>264<br>00:27:23,080 –&gt; 00:27:28,120<br>sort of the most challenging part in the system, namely, you know, building fault-all-enstormed systems.</p>
<p>265<br>00:27:29,320 –&gt; 00:27:34,040<br>And, you know, we’re now seeing a broad spectrum of different designs, including designs that</p>
<p>266<br>00:27:34,040 –&gt; 00:27:40,840<br>now actually support each very powerful programming abstraction of transactions. So in the next</p>
<p>267<br>00:27:41,560 –&gt; 00:27:45,880<br>this lecture or the remaining of this lecture and subsequent lectures, we’re going to sort of</p>
<p>268<br>00:27:45,880 –&gt; 00:27:52,520<br>look at different topics that are formulated through storage systems. And so the first topic</p>
<p>269<br>00:27:53,160 –&gt; 00:28:03,080<br>that we’re going to be talking about is spark.</p>
