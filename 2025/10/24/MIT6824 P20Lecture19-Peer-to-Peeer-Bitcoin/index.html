                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:12,780<br>Okay, good afternoon. Good morning. Good night. Let’s get started. Today I want to talk about</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:12,780 –&gt; 00:00:20,780<br>Bitcoin. The reason I want to talk about it is it solves a heart problem, namely achieving</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:20,780 –&gt; 00:00:44,299<br>consensus with Byzantine participants. And it solves it. So the Byzantine and the</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:44,299 –&gt; 00:00:51,099<br>Byzantine participants might be malicious or adversarial. And it solves this problem in the</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:51,099 –&gt; 00:00:58,539<br>context of completely open systems. People can join and leave the system and will. And some</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:58,539 –&gt; 00:01:06,700<br>of them may be malicious and yet achieve consensus on the order in which transaction happens.</p>
<p>7<br>00:01:06,700 –&gt; 00:01:12,939<br>So those are actually in a very challenging context, we’re actually really doing it with money involved.</p>
<p>8<br>00:01:15,100 –&gt; 00:01:23,099<br>The design looks a little bit like it has aspects of Sunder. Since there’s a sidewalk</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:25,260 –&gt; 00:01:31,579<br>of operations, in these cases, transactions. But unlike in Sunder, that actually can handle</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:31,579 –&gt; 00:01:44,459<br>forks. So most of the many aspects are interesting to talk about the respect of Bitcoin. But</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:44,459 –&gt; 00:01:49,180<br>mostly I’m going to focus on sort of the sort of the distributed systems aspect of this particular</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:49,180 –&gt; 00:01:58,620<br>paper. This paper is a bit unusual or quite unusual. First of all, this is not a paper out of the</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:58,620 –&gt; 00:02:03,660<br>sort of scientific literature that I’ve been reading so far. It comes out of a different part of</p>
<p>14<br>00:02:03,660 –&gt; 00:02:19,500<br>the world. It is pseudo-anonymous. And it has a particularly gripe with financial institutions.</p>
<p>15<br>00:02:20,620 –&gt; 00:02:27,340<br>And you can have a lot of opinions about where Bitcoin in general and cryptocurrencies in general.</p>
<p>16<br>00:02:28,140 –&gt; 00:02:32,939<br>But from the perspective of the system, this is a YouTube-stressful system. This is really</p>
<p>17<br>00:02:32,939 –&gt; 00:02:39,740<br>truly an open system that can tolerate the business participants in achieved consensus.</p>
<p>18<br>00:02:39,740 –&gt; 00:02:44,300<br>And so really, the focus on this lecture is trying to understand how actually you choose that</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:44,300 –&gt; 00:02:52,219<br>particular aspect. Any questions? Just to you for a dive in.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:57,659 –&gt; 00:03:09,659<br>Okay, so, as I mentioned, the context is here, the financial transactions. And so there’s</p>
<p>21<br>00:03:09,659 –&gt; 00:03:16,620<br>a free, overriding of concerns. When transactions are involved, or money transactions are involved,</p>
<p>22<br>00:03:16,620 –&gt; 00:03:20,140<br>first of all, of course, there’s a concern of outright forgery.</p>
<p>23<br>00:03:20,219 –&gt; 00:03:33,339<br>Where basically, people cook up transactions out of finair and enter them in the log and try to</p>
<p>24<br>00:03:33,339 –&gt; 00:03:40,060<br>do mislead other participants that actually are spending their own money while spending somebody</p>
<p>25<br>00:03:40,060 –&gt; 00:03:45,099<br>else’s money. And this problem is reasonable straightforward for us all, and in a very similar</p>
<p>26<br>00:03:45,180 –&gt; 00:03:52,699<br>style to Sunder. But basically, citing operations, make it hard to actually forge.</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:52,699 –&gt; 00:03:56,699<br>And in fact, in general, setting the year for it is the same as in Sunder, well,</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:56,699 –&gt; 00:04:02,060<br>you know, the Byzantine participants are very, very, very powerful. We’re going to be assuming that</p>
<p>29<br>00:04:02,060 –&gt; 00:04:09,259<br>the crypto systems actually work and cannot become compromised. And so a lot of the core functionality,</p>
<p>30<br>00:04:10,539 –&gt; 00:04:14,539<br>or the basis of which, we might conclude that actually things are our superior are all going to come</p>
<p>31<br>00:04:15,340 –&gt; 00:04:18,860<br>down to the fact that the underlying cryptography is correct.</p>
<p>32<br>00:04:20,779 –&gt; 00:04:25,740<br>So that’s one challenge. The second challenge, which is the one that the paper spends most,</p>
<p>33<br>00:04:25,740 –&gt; 00:04:28,139<br>it’s time talking about, is double spending.</p>
<p>34<br>00:04:33,740 –&gt; 00:04:38,219<br>So you literally have some good bitcoins that you accumulated,</p>
<p>35<br>00:04:38,700 –&gt; 00:04:46,860<br>and Byzantium participants are going to try to spend twice that same bitcoin. And of course,</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:46,860 –&gt; 00:04:51,900<br>we want to avoid that particular problem, that they don’t idea. And the main idea is we’ll see</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:51,900 –&gt; 00:04:59,020<br>is there’s a public ledger or a public log of all the transactions, so you can see if the</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:59,020 –&gt; 00:05:04,060<br>transaction actually without money was already spending early transaction. And really trying to</p>
<p>39<br>00:05:04,060 –&gt; 00:05:09,339<br>achieve consensus on what is actually in the log is the heart of the paper.</p>
<p>40<br>00:05:10,620 –&gt; 00:05:16,220<br>Then of course, in addition to these two, there should be obvious other problem,</p>
<p>41<br>00:05:16,220 –&gt; 00:05:19,340<br>which the paper doesn’t really talk much about, and we’re also not going to talk much about,</p>
<p>42<br>00:05:19,980 –&gt; 00:05:26,379<br>which is just theft. Where somebody actually steals somebody else’s private key,</p>
<p>43<br>00:05:26,379 –&gt; 00:05:31,740<br>and therefore they can spend money or bitcoins using that particular private key. And it turns</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:31,740 –&gt; 00:05:38,860<br>out to be in practice a serious problem. People store their wallets with their signing keys,</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:39,900 –&gt; 00:05:46,220<br>computers can be broken into, and therefore people can break over to steal somebody else’s money.</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:47,740 –&gt; 00:05:52,939<br>And I think a serious problem in practice. I’m not going to be spending much time talking about</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:52,939 –&gt; 00:05:56,060<br>in fact, and again, I would want to focus on the distributed systems aspects.</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:56,220 –&gt; 00:06:00,459<br>Any questions about the challenges?</p>
<p>49<br>00:06:06,459 –&gt; 00:06:10,060<br>Okay, now let’s look at the transaction then. What’s actually in it?</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:11,579 –&gt; 00:06:13,500<br>So this is basically what is in the ledger.</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:13,500 –&gt; 00:06:28,300<br>I think the simplify is greatly, because in some of the detailed actions, it doesn’t really matter</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:28,300 –&gt; 00:06:32,620<br>to the discussion that we’re going to have. And the first order you can just think about it is</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:32,939 –&gt; 00:06:38,220<br>every transaction is a record, and the record has a public key</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:43,819 –&gt; 00:06:49,660<br>of the user for which the money is intended. So this is the destination.</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:51,740 –&gt; 00:06:59,420<br>The hash of the previous transaction for this particular Bitcoin.</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:00,220 –&gt; 00:07:06,540<br>And a signature, and we have the private key.</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:11,180 –&gt; 00:07:17,340<br>You too, you know, we’re basically the preview owner of that particular Bitcoin.</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:19,340 –&gt; 00:07:23,259<br>And that’s sort of you can think about this as the source. So basically, you too is making,</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:23,980 –&gt; 00:07:29,180<br>granting Bitcoin, or transferring Bitcoins from you to what? So that you want to</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:29,180 –&gt; 00:07:34,379<br>and that can spend it. Of course, there’s no other stuff in it like there’s no mount in it,</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:34,379 –&gt; 00:07:40,779<br>and it’s a fractional amount. There are many destinations and many sources possible, many inns and out.</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:43,259 –&gt; 00:07:49,019<br>The reasons are basically all ignored and just focus on the simplified description.</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:49,019 –&gt; 00:07:54,219<br>Turns out that the injections are coded also, not sort of like passive records, but</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:54,859 –&gt; 00:08:00,620<br>basically in a little scripting language, and also going to ignore all those aspects.</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:02,379 –&gt; 00:08:06,219<br>And this technique I want to focus on this thing, and you know, talk a little bit, show a little</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:06,219 –&gt; 00:08:11,180<br>example, so that we give a little bit of a handle of actually what we’re looking at in terms of the</p>
<p>67<br>00:08:11,180 –&gt; 00:08:19,819<br>challenge. So let’s sort of look at an example ledger and sort of try to understand actually,</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:19,819 –&gt; 00:08:25,980<br>what it means to be a Bitcoin or what a coin is, because it’s not like, you know, it’s sort of a</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:25,980 –&gt; 00:08:31,899<br>single thing that really comes down to it’s actually sort of a, the shall one of the last transaction</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:31,899 –&gt; 00:08:40,620<br>that is sort of what a coin is. So let’s say, you know, why owns a coin and received from X.</p>
<p>71<br>00:08:41,340 –&gt; 00:08:44,459<br>And so that means that there’s somewhere in the ledger, there’s sort of some sort of</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:44,459 –&gt; 00:08:50,779<br>example of transactions that transfer the money or the coin or parts of the coin to Y.</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:50,779 –&gt; 00:08:56,220<br>And so let’s see, like somewhere maybe there’s an entry in the ledger somewhere in some</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:56,220 –&gt; 00:09:06,940<br>period of time where X actually received some bitcoins. And then, you know, this sort of</p>
<p>75<br>00:09:06,940 –&gt; 00:09:15,019<br>grancer that has given it to Y. So there’s another transaction in the ledger that basically</p>
<p>76<br>00:09:15,019 –&gt; 00:09:23,340<br>records that fact. And so that might have the key of Y, destination, the hash of the transaction</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:23,340 –&gt; 00:09:31,980<br>six. And so that uniquely identifies a shorthand handle for X and uniquely identifying transaction six.</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:31,980 –&gt; 00:09:35,660<br>And so we have the ledger or record that we think is transaction six. And then we can</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:35,660 –&gt; 00:09:40,540<br>re-pupute the hash of that transaction compared to the one that stored into section seven. And</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:40,540 –&gt; 00:09:45,899<br>we’re truly determined that basically, ah, transaction six, what’s the source, you know, for this</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:45,899 –&gt; 00:09:51,259<br>transaction seven. And we’re based the previous transaction, what’s transaction six for this particular</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:51,259 –&gt; 00:10:03,259<br>coin. And it’s assigned by X. Now, so this is sort of a situation where Y obtained, you know,</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:03,259 –&gt; 00:10:08,939<br>basically, you know, some bitcoins, you know, for X. And now, Y wants to spend, I spent, for</p>
<p>84<br>00:10:08,939 –&gt; 00:10:15,100<br>example, maybe Y wants to buy a latte, you know, from Z. And so it’s going to transfer some money</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:15,740 –&gt; 00:10:22,139<br>to Z. So maybe we’ll see another transaction in the ledger, which is going to be a perform.</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:22,139 –&gt; 00:10:24,139<br>You know, this is one that actually Y is going to add.</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:30,540 –&gt; 00:10:40,540<br>Z hash of the, you know, previous coin, which is the last injection for that coin. So that’s T seven.</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:40,539 –&gt; 00:10:49,099<br>And it’s assigned by Y. And basically, you know, C wants to, before you can see actually,</p>
<p>89<br>00:10:49,099 –&gt; 00:10:53,819<br>hands over the latte to Y. You know, C, you need to do some verification to make sure that</p>
<p>90<br>00:10:53,819 –&gt; 00:11:01,179<br>there’s actually is a legit, you know, transaction. So, you know, we’ll look up, you know, transaction seven.</p>
<p>91<br>00:11:02,699 –&gt; 00:11:06,779<br>And, you know, compute, you know, the hash of it, you know, double check that the hash, actually</p>
<p>92<br>00:11:06,779 –&gt; 00:11:13,819<br>corresponds to the one that actually is listed in transaction, in transaction eight. If, you know,</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:13,819 –&gt; 00:11:18,299<br>the hash, you know, checks out, so it’s transaction seven is indeed, you know, we believe that the</p>
<p>94<br>00:11:18,299 –&gt; 00:11:24,699<br>one that actually turns out to be actually refers to, you know, Z looks up the the public key in</p>
<p>95<br>00:11:25,419 –&gt; 00:11:32,299<br>transaction seven for Y, which usually is the public Y, then, you know, verifies that do that</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:32,299 –&gt; 00:11:36,939<br>public key to verify the signature, you know, of this transaction and the signature of course,</p>
<p>97<br>00:11:36,939 –&gt; 00:11:41,500<br>you know, publish, you know, the whole transaction. And if the signature checks out, you know, then,</p>
<p>98<br>00:11:42,620 –&gt; 00:11:48,379<br>you know, Z can be sort of confident, you know, that actually the ledger, you know, contains</p>
<p>99<br>00:11:48,379 –&gt; 00:11:53,979<br>and transaction that basically transfers, you know, some of the money from Y to Z. And so at this</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:53,980 –&gt; 00:12:03,740<br>point, you know, the verification, you know, Z verifies and it’s okay, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>101<br>00:12:03,740 –&gt; 00:12:15,980<br>ship the latte, and not, you know, reject. And again, like before, you know, the Sunder and</p>
<p>102<br>00:12:15,980 –&gt; 00:12:22,460<br>the Nuldu sort of schemes, you know, we’re lying here in the fact that basically Y, you know,</p>
<p>103<br>00:12:22,460 –&gt; 00:12:35,259<br>it’s careful with its private key. So, you know, we have to assume that Y didn’t disclose</p>
<p>104<br>00:12:36,940 –&gt; 00:12:46,860<br>in any way its private key. Because if anybody, I was going to have this private key, then basically anybody</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:46,860 –&gt; 00:12:51,420<br>could come up with a signature and, you know, is able to spend basically Y’s money.</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:53,420 –&gt; 00:12:55,900<br>Although maybe from the perspective of Z, you don’t really care.</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:57,900 –&gt; 00:13:08,220<br>Okay, so that’s sort of the basic plan in terms of, you know, having a record. And then, you know,</p>
<p>108<br>00:13:08,220 –&gt; 00:13:15,900<br>this is pretty good, right? I mean, the record of the transaction that happened, when C, you know,</p>
<p>109<br>00:13:15,900 –&gt; 00:13:20,060<br>received some transaction that could check whether this is a valid transaction. And,</p>
<p>110<br>00:13:20,059 –&gt; 00:13:25,259<br>that, you know, lots of the side where if you actually accept the money and deliver the goods.</p>
<p>111<br>00:13:26,619 –&gt; 00:13:37,099<br>So, one key challenge, and now it’s sort of left, you know, we sort of seen that outright forgery is</p>
<p>112<br>00:13:37,099 –&gt; 00:13:44,699<br>difficult. But, you know, we need to think a little bit about the double spending. And so, the double</p>
<p>113<br>00:13:44,700 –&gt; 00:13:49,100<br>spending problem is just follows. Let’s say instead of, you know, creating two record and one record,</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:49,100 –&gt; 00:13:58,860<br>as in this particular example in the transaction aid, Z actually integrates over a Y creates two records.</p>
<p>115<br>00:14:07,420 –&gt; 00:14:12,940<br>One record is basically giving the one that we just saw, you know, our T8.</p>
<p>116<br>00:14:14,860 –&gt; 00:14:17,259<br>Y2z with the hash of seven.</p>
<p>117<br>00:14:19,900 –&gt; 00:14:26,780<br>And then let’s assume that actually Y also tries to double spend its money. So, it creates a second</p>
<p>118<br>00:14:26,780 –&gt; 00:14:31,980<br>transaction, you know, T8 prime, where, you know, the record is basically the same except,</p>
<p>119<br>00:14:31,980 –&gt; 00:14:38,940<br>you know, the money, you know, maybe goes to Q. And that’s the hash of T7. And of course, you know,</p>
<p>120<br>00:14:38,940 –&gt; 00:14:42,060<br>signed by Y, you know, signed by Y.</p>
<p>121<br>00:14:47,340 –&gt; 00:14:52,940<br>Now, you know, let’s say, you know, both QZ are like a lot of these stores. If, you know,</p>
<p>122<br>00:14:54,220 –&gt; 00:15:00,140<br>ZXF-T8, as it would because, you know, everything will check out, as we saw in the previous</p>
<p>123<br>00:15:00,140 –&gt; 00:15:06,700<br>dislike. Then Z would actually ship a lot day to Y. When Q, not knowing anything, maybe about</p>
<p>124<br>00:15:06,700 –&gt; 00:15:13,020<br>this other T8 transaction, sees this T8 transaction, you know, checks out. It’s indeed the case that,</p>
<p>125<br>00:15:13,020 –&gt; 00:15:18,620<br>you know, the money in T7 was transferred to Y. The thing is, you know, checked, you know, with the</p>
<p>126<br>00:15:18,620 –&gt; 00:15:23,660<br>second year for Y, you know, it’s developed. And it will say, oh, I got great, you know, all</p>
<p>127<br>00:15:23,660 –&gt; 00:15:27,820<br>thank you for the money, all shipped you also a lot day. And now, so we’re in this bad, you know,</p>
<p>128<br>00:15:27,820 –&gt; 00:15:35,180<br>position where Y by double spending or succeeded in double spending and got two lot tips. And,</p>
<p>129<br>00:15:35,259 –&gt; 00:15:40,059<br>just the problem that basically the paper image really focused on trying to solve.</p>
<p>130<br>00:15:44,620 –&gt; 00:15:52,459<br>And the basic approach is sort of similar to what, you know, some of the reviews, you know,</p>
<p>131<br>00:15:52,459 –&gt; 00:15:55,819<br>let’s keep a complete lot of all transactions. Since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>132<br>00:15:55,980 –&gt; 00:16:07,820<br>And, you know, the log contains all the transactions, including in the order.</p>
<p>133<br>00:16:13,020 –&gt; 00:16:17,980<br>And so, you know, let’s see, you know, so we, we sort of put the disinjections in, you know,</p>
<p>134<br>00:16:17,980 –&gt; 00:16:25,100<br>whatever year we have, you know, T6, here we have T7. So if there’s a public record that is</p>
<p>135<br>00:16:25,100 –&gt; 00:16:29,420<br>ordered of all the transactions, you know, T8 or TA prime goes first, let’s say TA goes first.</p>
<p>136<br>00:16:30,620 –&gt; 00:16:38,779<br>And then TA prime goes in the log. And, you know, if this would happen, then, you know, no problem at</p>
<p>137<br>00:16:38,779 –&gt; 00:16:45,899<br>all, right, because this was the rejection from Y to Z. This was the rejection from Y to Q.</p>
<p>138<br>00:16:47,180 –&gt; 00:16:53,980<br>And, you know, basically when Q validates, you know, when Z to validate the injection,</p>
<p>139<br>00:16:53,980 –&gt; 00:16:58,860<br>everything looks perfect as exactly as before, when Q validates the transaction, in addition to the</p>
<p>140<br>00:16:58,860 –&gt; 00:17:04,140<br>checks, you know, which is looked at, it actually looks into log, you know, Q looks in log.</p>
<p>141<br>00:17:07,420 –&gt; 00:17:10,140<br>Log to see if T7 basically always was already spent.</p>
<p>142<br>00:17:10,300 –&gt; 00:17:27,180<br>And then, of course, it scans back in log, you know, runs into TY, T8, and you know, sees that the</p>
<p>143<br>00:17:27,180 –&gt; 00:17:32,220<br>action the money has been spent. And so therefore, it will reject, you know, T8 prime.</p>
<p>144<br>00:17:32,940 –&gt; 00:17:40,620<br>All right. So, so that’s the basic plan. And so, basically, you know, we reduced this one problem,</p>
<p>145<br>00:17:40,620 –&gt; 00:17:48,140<br>which is like, how do we actually ensure that all participants in the systems actually agree on</p>
<p>146<br>00:17:48,140 –&gt; 00:17:53,900<br>this log. And, you know, all the transactions are in the same slot everywhere, and contain the same</p>
<p>147<br>00:17:53,900 –&gt; 00:17:58,779<br>content, the same hash, the same signature, so that we can actually verify the transactions,</p>
<p>148<br>00:17:58,779 –&gt; 00:18:03,019<br>you know, using the scheme that the, the, the, the sort of laid out on this slide.</p>
<p>149<br>00:18:03,819 –&gt; 00:18:10,940<br>And so, this is where the sort of consensus problem comes in, and sometimes people refer to</p>
<p>150<br>00:18:10,940 –&gt; 00:18:17,579<br>the solution here as the Nakamoto consensus protocol. Now, before diving into that protocol,</p>
<p>151<br>00:18:18,460 –&gt; 00:18:24,619<br>want to sort of sketch out, you know, possible solutions that are not going to work,</p>
<p>152<br>00:18:25,339 –&gt; 00:18:28,619<br>just to get a little bit of better sense, and by like, you know, what the challenges are,</p>
<p>153<br>00:18:28,619 –&gt; 00:18:37,819<br>that, you know, this sort of Nakamoto consensus actually, salts. So, design one,</p>
<p>154<br>00:18:39,739 –&gt; 00:18:45,099<br>there’s not really design. It’s more sort of an idea to sort of think about, and then reject.</p>
<p>155<br>00:18:46,459 –&gt; 00:18:52,379<br>Design one, you know, maybe the easiest design is, let’s assume we have a server S,</p>
<p>156<br>00:18:52,460 –&gt; 00:19:00,460<br>and the server actually is just trusted. And then we have clients, you know, that, you know,</p>
<p>157<br>00:19:01,340 –&gt; 00:19:03,580<br>submit transactions, whatever, T6,</p>
<p>158<br>00:19:08,780 –&gt; 00:19:15,740<br>one, two, whatever, we do X, Y, Z, and they just submit, you know, these transactions through the,</p>
<p>159<br>00:19:16,700 –&gt; 00:19:21,900<br>through the Strustless server, you know, if we, all the clients can trust the server,</p>
<p>160<br>00:19:21,900 –&gt; 00:19:25,500<br>and the server can just produce a log, all right, we have all the transactions in it,</p>
<p>161<br>00:19:27,259 –&gt; 00:19:29,980<br>and you know, order them appropriately, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>162<br>00:19:31,819 –&gt; 00:19:35,259<br>So, if we assume, you know, there’s a trustless server, and then this problem is actually</p>
<p>163<br>00:19:35,259 –&gt; 00:19:38,220<br>reasonable, and straightforward to solve, and you know, if that’s the setting that we’re in,</p>
<p>164<br>00:19:38,220 –&gt; 00:19:43,019<br>then we’re in great shape. You know, maybe we’ll replicate the server using, you know,</p>
<p>165<br>00:19:43,099 –&gt; 00:19:50,700<br>so, raft, and a type of protocol, and we have a full-time server, and you know, really the only</p>
<p>166<br>00:19:50,700 –&gt; 00:19:55,019<br>downside, you know, to this particular process is that the clients can just not agree on a single</p>
<p>167<br>00:19:55,019 –&gt; 00:20:00,379<br>trusted server. And so, you know, for example, in the case of Bitcoin, and where you want to do</p>
<p>168<br>00:20:00,379 –&gt; 00:20:07,180<br>transactions, you know, maybe the, you know, the rest of the world will not trust the US government</p>
<p>169<br>00:20:07,259 –&gt; 00:20:13,420<br>to actually, you know, implement the server correctly and produce a log, and in that case,</p>
<p>170<br>00:20:13,420 –&gt; 00:20:19,180<br>you know, we have multiple different clients, which cannot agree on a trusted server,</p>
<p>171<br>00:20:19,180 –&gt; 00:20:28,060<br>then this, this solution is just a server doesn’t work. So, that’s one solution. It’s the easy one,</p>
<p>172<br>00:20:28,060 –&gt; 00:20:32,860<br>but in the case of decentralized design, where the participants, and don’t trust any central</p>
<p>173<br>00:20:32,859 –&gt; 00:20:39,899<br>component, this is not a workable solution. So, now we consider, you know, using sort of the</p>
<p>174<br>00:20:39,899 –&gt; 00:20:46,139<br>more thunder-like approach, modified just scheme slightly, and say, like, okay, good, we now actually</p>
<p>175<br>00:20:46,139 –&gt; 00:20:51,179<br>have to deal with untrust the server. In fact, we were at a paper about it last week, and so,</p>
<p>176<br>00:20:51,899 –&gt; 00:20:56,859<br>let’s assume that this server’s actually untrust it. And, you know, it basically, you know,</p>
<p>177<br>00:20:56,859 –&gt; 00:21:01,819<br>played a Thunder game, the clients produce the logs, we eat the logs from the server,</p>
<p>178<br>00:21:01,819 –&gt; 00:21:07,259<br>a penta-rockets to the, the clients of penta-rockets to the log, submit it back to the server.</p>
<p>179<br>00:21:07,259 –&gt; 00:21:10,939<br>And so, the server’s basically doing almost nothing else, and then so, we’re laying logs,</p>
<p>180<br>00:21:10,939 –&gt; 00:21:15,579<br>you know, between different clients. And, you know, we’ve seen in last week that that</p>
<p>181<br>00:21:15,579 –&gt; 00:21:23,659<br>approach works really well, and you know, can be used, but, you know, it has one shortcoming,</p>
<p>182<br>00:21:23,659 –&gt; 00:21:30,059<br>as we saw, namely, the server can present two different views of the world by basically</p>
<p>183<br>00:21:30,139 –&gt; 00:21:36,059<br>forking the log. So, maybe the log has some prefix, you know, whatever, T1, T5, T5, T6, T6, T7,</p>
<p>184<br>00:21:36,059 –&gt; 00:21:42,619<br>but, you know, it has, you know, T8 in this one, and it has another log, which indeed has T7,</p>
<p>185<br>00:21:44,779 –&gt; 00:21:52,379<br>and T8 prime. And so, one fork, you know, we got our T8 on the other fork, we have T8 prime,</p>
<p>186<br>00:21:53,020 –&gt; 00:22:02,300<br>and now, like, we became really resettled in one particular fork, and the server sort of</p>
<p>187<br>00:22:02,300 –&gt; 00:22:06,380<br>persistently, you know, keeps the two worlds apart, so, like, so why is it in the, of a</p>
<p>188<br>00:22:06,380 –&gt; 00:22:12,460<br>season one area of the world’s accused another in the world? Why always gets the first sort of log,</p>
<p>189<br>00:22:12,460 –&gt; 00:22:17,580<br>and the, and Zio always gets the second one log, or two, the other way around, then,</p>
<p>190<br>00:22:17,740 –&gt; 00:22:22,619<br>you know, then they will pretend, they’re going to get it, they’re going to get it, there’s no money</p>
<p>191<br>00:22:22,619 –&gt; 00:22:31,179<br>earlier spent in T7, in this log, so, you know, T8, Q will actually accept, you know, T8 prime in this</p>
<p>192<br>00:22:31,179 –&gt; 00:22:36,779<br>world, and here Z will accept, you know, T8, and so why is succeeded in actually double spend?</p>
<p>193<br>00:22:38,460 –&gt; 00:22:45,980<br>And so, so this design doesn’t work, for the particular problem at hand, we need some solution,</p>
<p>194<br>00:22:45,980 –&gt; 00:22:50,700<br>and this is where the consensus comes in, we need some solution, basically, for the untrusted</p>
<p>195<br>00:22:50,700 –&gt; 00:23:00,620<br>clients, to basically be able to settle on which, you know, fork they are. Okay, so, in, so let’s</p>
<p>196<br>00:23:00,620 –&gt; 00:23:04,620<br>sort of think a little bit about that, so, like, so think about it more, more decentralized design,</p>
<p>197<br>00:23:04,620 –&gt; 00:23:07,980<br>where, you know, we’re just going to replace the server with a network of computers.</p>
<p>198<br>00:23:09,019 –&gt; 00:23:14,620<br>That’s it, and this is there, and this goes there sort of to get the closer to the Bitcoin design,</p>
<p>199<br>00:23:14,619 –&gt; 00:23:21,579<br>where there’s indeed a network of, you know, peers that sort of all collaborate together,</p>
<p>200<br>00:23:21,579 –&gt; 00:23:27,579<br>if you should provide, you know, this single log, although even some of the participants actually</p>
<p>201<br>00:23:27,579 –&gt; 00:23:31,099<br>might have, you might make some, try to do something different. And so, basically, idea is that,</p>
<p>202<br>00:23:31,099 –&gt; 00:23:36,299<br>you know, when a client actually, you know, have to create some transaction, you know,</p>
<p>203<br>00:23:36,299 –&gt; 00:23:41,259<br>the intersection, actually, distributed across a network, you know, of peers.</p>
<p>204<br>00:23:41,420 –&gt; 00:23:46,940<br>So, in fact, the client one might be appear in self, so the transaction is spread around.</p>
<p>205<br>00:23:50,700 –&gt; 00:23:56,859<br>And, you know, everybody, you know, in a network actually maintains a log, and</p>
<p>206<br>00:23:56,859 –&gt; 00:23:59,099<br>it depends, you know, the transaction to its log.</p>
<p>207<br>00:24:03,740 –&gt; 00:24:08,700<br>And the problem that we sort of have left is, like, you know, how to agree on an order.</p>
<p>208<br>00:24:11,259 –&gt; 00:24:25,019<br>And, you know, we actually have seen, you know, this kind of sort of systems before, like, in fact,</p>
<p>209<br>00:24:25,019 –&gt; 00:24:29,339<br>in RAP, you know, we had multiple computers, and they were able to agree on an order, right?</p>
<p>210<br>00:24:29,339 –&gt; 00:24:34,619<br>And the basic trick, you know, with your sort of basic insight is, you know, to basically compute,</p>
<p>211<br>00:24:34,619 –&gt; 00:24:39,740<br>you know, some majority, and have majority of the nodes agree that in slot, you know, six is</p>
<p>212<br>00:24:39,740 –&gt; 00:24:47,259<br>going to be transaction T8, and in slot seven is going to be T8 prime. And the,</p>
<p>213<br>00:24:48,940 –&gt; 00:24:53,900<br>and that works great, correct? If we know exactly how many nodes there are in the system,</p>
<p>214<br>00:24:55,180 –&gt; 00:25:00,700<br>we know there are five nodes in the system, the node, and the majority is free, and so if we</p>
<p>215<br>00:25:00,700 –&gt; 00:25:05,180<br>receive a response from free, you know, participants, you know, we know we can commit to that,</p>
<p>216<br>00:25:05,180 –&gt; 00:25:09,660<br>that’s going to be a problem. And the problem here really here is that this is a decentralized system,</p>
<p>217<br>00:25:09,660 –&gt; 00:25:17,820<br>that’s completely open. The system knows what it may even, may leave and come in any particular</p>
<p>218<br>00:25:17,820 –&gt; 00:25:22,299<br>point of time, and then I’m like, there is no list of all the participants in the system. So,</p>
<p>219<br>00:25:22,299 –&gt; 00:25:26,779<br>there’s also no, you know, clear what actually, what is a majority system like that.</p>
<p>220<br>00:25:31,180 –&gt; 00:25:34,060<br>Because it’s completely open, and so it’s like in the notion of a majority,</p>
<p>221<br>00:25:34,059 –&gt; 00:25:39,980<br>it’s completely able to find. So, you know, we need some sort of sort of like our sort of</p>
<p>222<br>00:25:39,980 –&gt; 00:25:46,379<br>usual game of sort of doing voting on a majority, and then accept the result of the majority,</p>
<p>223<br>00:25:46,379 –&gt; 00:25:51,419<br>is not going to sort of play out. And so this sort of the game, this sort of raft, you know,</p>
<p>224<br>00:25:51,419 –&gt; 00:25:54,779<br>even though it’s a consensus protocol, it’s not going to really work out because, you know,</p>
<p>225<br>00:25:55,819 –&gt; 00:26:01,019<br>the setting order we’re dealing with is a decentralized open distributed system, as opposed to</p>
<p>226<br>00:26:01,019 –&gt; 00:26:09,099<br>a closed system, as in the setting of raft. Does this make sense so far?</p>
<p>227<br>00:26:10,779 –&gt; 00:26:13,740<br>Let me pause for a second before getting into the more technical part.</p>
<p>228<br>00:26:20,940 –&gt; 00:26:21,259<br>All right.</p>
<p>229<br>00:26:26,059 –&gt; 00:26:29,819<br>Okay, so how this Bitcoin solved this problem?</p>
<p>230<br>00:26:31,339 –&gt; 00:26:38,619<br>And the key idea is something that’s called proof of work.</p>
<p>231<br>00:26:45,819 –&gt; 00:26:56,139<br>Basically, the rule is that there’s a minor work, a note means you do to actually be able to</p>
<p>232<br>00:26:56,140 –&gt; 00:27:07,100<br>extend the log. And the base rule is that the winner in proof of work,</p>
<p>233<br>00:27:08,700 –&gt; 00:27:15,580<br>the machine that’s able to solve the puzzle first, this decides on the next log entry.</p>
<p>234<br>00:27:15,579 –&gt; 00:27:32,059<br>And the basic idea that this might actually get, so the integration of why this actually will work out,</p>
<p>235<br>00:27:32,059 –&gt; 00:27:34,699<br>is because it’s basically hard to impersonate the winner.</p>
<p>236<br>00:27:34,700 –&gt; 00:27:51,580<br>To actually solve the particular proof of work puzzle that needs to be able to add to the log,</p>
<p>237<br>00:27:51,580 –&gt; 00:27:59,980<br>actually requires a real computer, a month, get roughly a computer time to actually solve the problem.</p>
<p>238<br>00:27:59,980 –&gt; 00:28:03,819<br>And so if you can solve and demonstrate yourself the problem, you know, you know, for sure that</p>
<p>239<br>00:28:03,819 –&gt; 00:28:09,180<br>somebody actually spend a month of work actually doing it. And this is sort of enough of to</p>
<p>240<br>00:28:12,460 –&gt; 00:28:20,539<br>convince the rest of the system that the real resources were actually spent to</p>
<p>241<br>00:28:21,740 –&gt; 00:28:27,500<br>append to be able to append to the log entry. And you can maybe think of other types of schemes,</p>
<p>242<br>00:28:27,500 –&gt; 00:28:32,299<br>like you know, whatever, unique IP addresses or things like that, but all those kind of things</p>
<p>243<br>00:28:32,299 –&gt; 00:28:39,660<br>can be actually easily falsified. And so, and sort of proof of work idea is sort of your core</p>
<p>244<br>00:28:39,660 –&gt; 00:28:48,619<br>to demonstrate that, yeah, actually really put a month effort into actually to figure out what</p>
<p>245<br>00:28:48,619 –&gt; 00:28:53,579<br>the next door to compute be able to be able to append to the log entry to the log.</p>
<p>246<br>00:28:57,339 –&gt; 00:29:01,979<br>One, you know, just to get that only me the other way, one downside of the sort of proof of work</p>
<p>247<br>00:29:01,979 –&gt; 00:29:05,339<br>approach is that it actually can waste energy.</p>
<p>248<br>00:29:11,099 –&gt; 00:29:16,699<br>And in fact, if your, you know, Bitcoin has become so successful that a lot of people are down,</p>
<p>249<br>00:29:16,700 –&gt; 00:29:22,299<br>there are, you know, mining and doing this proof of work, the energy bill or the energy</p>
<p>250<br>00:29:22,299 –&gt; 00:29:31,900<br>consumption of all the combined miners together is incredibly significant and huge. And so,</p>
<p>251<br>00:29:33,340 –&gt; 00:29:40,779<br>fully downside of this approach is the waste of energy. In recent years, you know, there have</p>
<p>252<br>00:29:40,779 –&gt; 00:29:47,180<br>been other crypto currencies or other designs that are based on a different idea. Instead of</p>
<p>253<br>00:29:47,180 –&gt; 00:29:49,899<br>proof of work, they’re actually based on some of that’s called proof of stake.</p>
<p>254<br>00:29:56,859 –&gt; 00:30:01,660<br>And this basically sort of the game there is that like, you know, let’s say your own 3% of,</p>
<p>255<br>00:30:01,660 –&gt; 00:30:10,139<br>you know, the currency, then you get the, because of your own 3%, you can actually decide, you know,</p>
<p>256<br>00:30:10,140 –&gt; 00:30:16,220<br>for 3% of the log entry, you know, which ones are going to be dependent. And so, the,</p>
<p>257<br>00:30:17,180 –&gt; 00:30:22,700<br>and so this is a completely different approach and that doesn’t require solving computational</p>
<p>258<br>00:30:22,700 –&gt; 00:30:31,340<br>intensive puzzles. And it seems to get quite a bit of actually attention and, you know, there are</p>
<p>259<br>00:30:31,340 –&gt; 00:30:35,900<br>cryptocurrencies that use it. And in fact, it looks like one of the more major major ones,</p>
<p>260<br>00:30:35,980 –&gt; 00:30:41,259<br>Ethereum seems to be sort of slated or going in the direction of a proof of stake approach.</p>
<p>261<br>00:30:42,300 –&gt; 00:30:47,580<br>But Bitcoin, they use a proof of work approach. And so, we’re going to just going to proceed, you know,</p>
<p>262<br>00:30:47,580 –&gt; 00:30:52,540<br>with that design. Any questions?</p>
<p>263<br>00:30:55,340 –&gt; 00:31:01,500<br>So, let’s, so I’m just wondering of how it’s hard to impersonate the winner. So, let’s say that we</p>
<p>264<br>00:31:01,500 –&gt; 00:31:08,299<br>have server 8 and server 8 and server 8 wants to append entry, let’s say E1 and server 8 wants to</p>
<p>265<br>00:31:08,299 –&gt; 00:31:15,180<br>append entry E2. So, server 8 solves the puzzle and publishes the solution, right? And I’m assuming</p>
<p>266<br>00:31:15,180 –&gt; 00:31:20,700<br>that the solution is easy to check. So, then server b sees the solution and checks that it’s correct.</p>
<p>267<br>00:31:22,619 –&gt; 00:31:29,579<br>So, it cannot work that server b just simply republishes the solution with its own name and</p>
<p>268<br>00:31:29,579 –&gt; 00:31:34,779<br>signing it by its own name because the puzzle for E2 is different from the puzzle for E1, right?</p>
<p>269<br>00:31:36,139 –&gt; 00:31:39,659<br>Yeah, we, yeah, exactly. And we’ll see, you know, we’ll get into this in more detail in the second.</p>
<p>270<br>00:31:40,619 –&gt; 00:31:43,899<br>In court, this year, this is sort of the basic insight, you know, it’s of course not enough.</p>
<p>271<br>00:31:45,419 –&gt; 00:31:49,899<br>But it won’t turn out to be enough to basically settle on a fork. So, we’re going to accept</p>
<p>272<br>00:31:49,899 –&gt; 00:31:54,059<br>there going to be forks and then we’re going to have, you know, Bitcoin basically accepts their</p>
<p>273<br>00:31:54,059 –&gt; 00:31:58,699<br>forks, like in Sunder, but then has a way of basically deciding which fork to settle on.</p>
<p>274<br>00:32:00,059 –&gt; 00:32:05,419<br>Yeah. So, I had a question about network traditions.</p>
<p>275<br>00:32:05,980 –&gt; 00:32:13,579<br>Yeah. And I was wondering how, like, you know, if you were able to make a partition, like on the</p>
<p>276<br>00:32:13,579 –&gt; 00:32:19,179<br>internet, which, you know, it’s probably like unreasonable, but you’re able to partition the internet,</p>
<p>277<br>00:32:19,179 –&gt; 00:32:28,460<br>like the whole internet. And could you convince, like, you know, one, like double spend by like</p>
<p>278<br>00:32:28,460 –&gt; 00:32:32,860<br>spending on both sides of the partition? Yeah, the partition never heals.</p>
<p>279<br>00:32:34,140 –&gt; 00:32:40,940<br>If you succeed, like eventually, you’d assume it heals, but then by then, like,</p>
<p>280<br>00:32:41,660 –&gt; 00:32:45,819<br>you probably would’ve gotten like something shipped or… Yeah. So, in general, we’ll see you</p>
<p>281<br>00:32:45,819 –&gt; 00:32:49,259<br>with, we’ll talk a little bit more about it, but like, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>282<br>00:32:49,259 –&gt; 00:32:52,140<br>the, the, the, the, the, the, the, there’s ways of creating forks and when you’re describing</p>
<p>283<br>00:32:52,220 –&gt; 00:32:56,780<br>is basically for it, that persists for a long period of time. And, you know, we’ll see the, the,</p>
<p>284<br>00:32:58,060 –&gt; 00:33:03,580<br>basically, the, and I’m Bitcoin, the, basically produces these blocks, the transactions, sort of,</p>
<p>285<br>00:33:03,580 –&gt; 00:33:08,300<br>every 10 minutes. And, you know, if you’re very conservative or you’re, you’re, you’re going to be</p>
<p>286<br>00:33:08,300 –&gt; 00:33:14,860<br>careful, you know, not to be, uh, uh, avoid double spending or making sure that there’s nothing</p>
<p>287<br>00:33:14,860 –&gt; 00:33:19,820<br>worth double spend, you generally wait, you know, for multiple these blocks to appear, like five,</p>
<p>288<br>00:33:19,819 –&gt; 00:33:25,019<br>six, so basically an hour before actually decide to actually accept, you know, the, to say, oh,</p>
<p>289<br>00:33:25,019 –&gt; 00:33:29,740<br>yeah, that this is, I’m on the right fork. Thanks.</p>
<p>290<br>00:33:39,019 –&gt; 00:33:46,700<br>Okay, so, let’s look at how the pieces fit together. Um, so it turns out, you know, the,</p>
<p>291<br>00:33:46,779 –&gt; 00:33:51,580<br>you know, do a proof of work, you know, for transaction, uh, that would be crazy, uh, because you’re,</p>
<p>292<br>00:33:51,580 –&gt; 00:33:55,180<br>you gotta spend a lot of computational power, you know, for them, for that one single transaction,</p>
<p>293<br>00:33:55,180 –&gt; 00:34:00,620<br>that will limit the number of transactions you can actually do per second. And so, uh, the way</p>
<p>294<br>00:34:00,620 –&gt; 00:34:07,100<br>actually this is done is basically transaction or, uh, grouping blocks and the proof of work, uh,</p>
<p>295<br>00:34:07,100 –&gt; 00:34:11,579<br>is done on a, on a block basis. And so we have our network,</p>
<p>296<br>00:34:11,659 –&gt; 00:34:19,099<br>you know, the way that actually works is that we’re not making a lot of blogs, but like we, you know,</p>
<p>297<br>00:34:19,099 –&gt; 00:34:23,340<br>we, uh, a lot of transactions, we make actually a lot of, uh, blocks, which are called, you know,</p>
<p>298<br>00:34:23,340 –&gt; 00:34:24,460<br>basically a blockchain.</p>
<p>299<br>00:34:28,699 –&gt; 00:34:35,819<br>And so, you’ve got our network, you know, we appears or around the world. And, uh, you know,</p>
<p>300<br>00:34:35,819 –&gt; 00:34:38,940<br>the blog, you know, is basically, you know, sequence of blocks.</p>
<p>301<br>00:34:42,539 –&gt; 00:34:47,340<br>And so, appears, you know, copies of these, you know, they may compute new ones, you know,</p>
<p>302<br>00:34:47,340 –&gt; 00:34:53,099<br>append them and distribute them and flood them across the network. And so what is in a, in a block?</p>
<p>303<br>00:34:55,099 –&gt; 00:35:00,299<br>You had a very high level. Again, there’s many more details that I’m just going to ignore.</p>
<p>304<br>00:35:01,099 –&gt; 00:35:06,539<br>It’s going to be the hash of the previous block. So, you know, B minus 1.</p>
<p>305<br>00:35:07,500 –&gt; 00:35:13,420<br>And so if this is block 5, you know, this is going to be then, uh, you know, B4, so B minus 1.</p>
<p>306<br>00:35:14,460 –&gt; 00:35:20,139<br>So the unique identifier of the, basically, the previous block in the, in the chain, the transactions</p>
<p>307<br>00:35:20,139 –&gt; 00:35:28,300<br>that are part of this block. And then a nonce, we’ll talk about in a second, but this is the</p>
<p>308<br>00:35:28,300 –&gt; 00:35:34,139<br>thing that is going to play crucial role in the, uh, the puzzle and the timestamp.</p>
<p>309<br>00:35:37,019 –&gt; 00:35:44,380<br>And, you know, this is about, typically, I want to see you a little bit, you know, think about</p>
<p>310<br>00:35:44,380 –&gt; 00:35:52,460<br>this as roughly a megabyte block. So basically, the, the game is, you know, the, the, the</p>
<p>311<br>00:35:52,460 –&gt; 00:36:00,139<br>peers of collect transactions, uh, then, uh, basically solve the puzzle. Uh, and once they solve</p>
<p>312<br>00:36:00,139 –&gt; 00:36:05,099<br>the puzzle, they’re going to ship the block to, uh, everybody in the, in the network.</p>
<p>313<br>00:36:05,819 –&gt; 00:36:10,859<br>Everybody can check whether the peer actually solves the puzzle correctly. And it is, you know,</p>
<p>314<br>00:36:10,859 –&gt; 00:36:14,539<br>the possible is correct. You solve correctly in the transaction checkout and, you know,</p>
<p>315<br>00:36:14,539 –&gt; 00:36:18,059<br>everything the hash is check out. And then they’re going to basically accept that block as the</p>
<p>316<br>00:36:18,059 –&gt; 00:36:28,460<br>next block in the chain. So a little bit more detail. Uh, you know, when, you know, basically the</p>
<p>317<br>00:36:28,460 –&gt; 00:36:35,340<br>winner gets to the site, uh, on the next block. So we have a new block.</p>
<p>318<br>00:36:39,740 –&gt; 00:36:43,900<br>Uh, and this is basically going to be the proof of work, which is done typically that the</p>
<p>319<br>00:36:43,900 –&gt; 00:36:48,380<br>party that does the proof of work is called the miners. And we’ll see in a second why.</p>
<p>320<br>00:36:50,059 –&gt; 00:36:57,500<br>Um, and basically the, uh, the game that the, uh, we’re going to play is that the, um,</p>
<p>321<br>00:36:58,460 –&gt; 00:37:06,860<br>uh, the miner has to compute a hash of this new block for that basically has,</p>
<p>322<br>00:37:09,099 –&gt; 00:37:12,780<br>has N leading zeros.</p>
<p>323<br>00:37:17,579 –&gt; 00:37:24,139<br>So, and the way, you know, the, the miner can do that is basically by changing the knot. So</p>
<p>324<br>00:37:24,139 –&gt; 00:37:29,980<br>basically the miner makes, you know, random guesses for a nonce, uh, compute the hash and,</p>
<p>325<br>00:37:29,980 –&gt; 00:37:34,940<br>and checks, you know, the number of leading zeros. And if the leading number of leading zeros is,</p>
<p>326<br>00:37:34,940 –&gt; 00:37:38,940<br>you know, in a larger, then, you know, basically that is a block that’s going to be accepted.</p>
<p>327<br>00:37:39,900 –&gt; 00:37:44,299<br>The only way you can think about it is that basically the hash value is below some particular,</p>
<p>328<br>00:37:45,659 –&gt; 00:37:51,500<br>uh, uh, bloatial, particular difficulty value. Uh, this end can be tuned,</p>
<p>329<br>00:37:52,139 –&gt; 00:37:59,820<br>over time. Also, seeing the second later, uh, to, you know, adjust the difficulty, um, uh, and,</p>
<p>330<br>00:37:59,820 –&gt; 00:38:05,340<br>but on average, you know, what, you know, the amount of work that is necessary, you know,</p>
<p>331<br>00:38:05,340 –&gt; 00:38:11,179<br>sort of the targeting is about like, you know, roughly a CPU month of, you know, computation.</p>
<p>332<br>00:38:12,699 –&gt; 00:38:15,739<br>And it’s not really expressing that ways with the expression terms of number of hash,</p>
<p>333<br>00:38:15,739 –&gt; 00:38:20,459<br>you can do per second, uh, but then it compoyles down to sort of shooting, shooting without kind of</p>
<p>334<br>00:38:20,459 –&gt; 00:38:25,419<br>a number. Of course, a lot of peers, you know, do this in parallel, you know, they’re, I think,</p>
<p>335<br>00:38:25,419 –&gt; 00:38:29,899<br>the network is currently around 10,000 nodes, so 10,000 nodes might be, and there might be many more</p>
<p>336<br>00:38:29,899 –&gt; 00:38:35,500<br>miners, um, I think the hundreds of thousands of miners, and you know, they might get lucky,</p>
<p>337<br>00:38:35,500 –&gt; 00:38:40,619<br>right? And, you know, you pick, you know, the right ones, if we’re quickly, um, and some of them actually,</p>
<p>338<br>00:38:40,619 –&gt; 00:38:45,819<br>uh, uh, get quickly, and so what they’re shooting sort of roughly is that, you know,</p>
<p>339<br>00:38:45,819 –&gt; 00:38:49,819<br>that the first one, you know, to actually solve the puzzle, that takes about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>340<br>00:38:54,380 –&gt; 00:39:00,460<br>And, you know, by adjusting the difficulty, you know, the, the, the, the vertical, it’s just,</p>
<p>341<br>00:39:00,460 –&gt; 00:39:05,420<br>you know, the time, where the, the, the time it will take to actually, you know, compute one of</p>
<p>342<br>00:39:05,420 –&gt; 00:39:10,139<br>these hashish and the, sort of the energy that one has to put into to actually solve the, the possible</p>
<p>343<br>00:39:11,099 –&gt; 00:39:17,739<br>and so whenever, uh, you know, the, whatever miner, you know, sort of solves this puzzle first,</p>
<p>344<br>00:39:17,739 –&gt; 00:39:22,699<br>basically gets to, uh, spread the block across the network, and basically has sort of about 10</p>
<p>345<br>00:39:22,699 –&gt; 00:39:27,259<br>minutes, you know, to do so, right? And so, you know, one reason to, the, the 10 minutes is there,</p>
<p>346<br>00:39:27,259 –&gt; 00:39:30,859<br>is that, you know, we’ll take a little bit of time to move that one thing about a block, you know,</p>
<p>347<br>00:39:30,859 –&gt; 00:39:36,139<br>across, you know, the many, many peers that are in the network, and, uh, you want to make sure that</p>
<p>348<br>00:39:36,219 –&gt; 00:39:43,579<br>there’s enough time to sort of get the, uh, the block out to many of the peers, uh, so that you can</p>
<p>349<br>00:39:43,579 –&gt; 00:39:49,179<br>avoid forks, as we’ll see in a second. And so before that somebody else actually, you know, solves the</p>
<p>350<br>00:39:49,179 –&gt; 00:40:01,099<br>puzzle too. Um, Professor. Yeah. So, um, this, the number of leading zeros that, uh, hash needs,</p>
<p>351<br>00:40:01,739 –&gt; 00:40:06,539<br>like to be accepted by node, is that number like set by each node individually? Like,</p>
<p>352<br>00:40:06,539 –&gt; 00:40:09,579<br>no, no, no, no, this is part of the protocol. This is a really brief part of,</p>
<p>353<br>00:40:10,059 –&gt; 00:40:16,539<br>right, but, but like, the census on the, uh, what ends? Um, but what, what I mean is like, it’s part</p>
<p>354<br>00:40:16,539 –&gt; 00:40:28,299<br>of the protocol, but like, um, so, so, so, well, behave nodes will follow it, but they, but,</p>
<p>355<br>00:40:28,300 –&gt; 00:40:35,100<br>who calculates it? Is it a central server that, uh, that calculates the same and sends it out or</p>
<p>356<br>00:40:35,100 –&gt; 00:40:40,060<br>every, no, no, no, we’ll see in a second later actually how it’s computed. Uh, but basically what,</p>
<p>357<br>00:40:40,060 –&gt; 00:40:45,260<br>I can give you a hint about how it’s computed. One reason the timestamps are in these things,</p>
<p>358<br>00:40:46,539 –&gt; 00:40:52,700<br>uh, is that like, if the time between blocks becomes too low, then the difficulty goes up.</p>
<p>359<br>00:40:52,699 –&gt; 00:40:57,739<br>Mm-hmm. And, you know, these timestamps, of course, are validated, you know, using the</p>
<p>360<br>00:40:57,739 –&gt; 00:41:01,659<br>hashers and all the kind of stuff and sitting in the blockchain. Everybody sees the same blockchain,</p>
<p>361<br>00:41:01,659 –&gt; 00:41:05,579<br>uh, so they will compute the, you know, the same difference between the timestamps and, you know,</p>
<p>362<br>00:41:05,579 –&gt; 00:41:10,299<br>therefore, they make the same adjustment in terms of difficulty. Right. Um, and this is one of the</p>
<p>363<br>00:41:10,299 –&gt; 00:41:13,899<br>cool parts, right? We’re having a log of everything that’s in there. Like, if, you know, I have some</p>
<p>364<br>00:41:13,899 –&gt; 00:41:17,899<br>determinants, you could compute any deterministic function, you’re like the content of the log.</p>
<p>365<br>00:41:18,700 –&gt; 00:41:25,260<br>Right. Okay. Um, so, so it would be a deterministic function, but, but at the end of the day, like,</p>
<p>366<br>00:41:25,260 –&gt; 00:41:33,820<br>if, if I like try and get away with like sending less than n, like zeros, then each</p>
<p>367<br>00:41:33,820 –&gt; 00:41:38,700<br>individual node in the network should call me out. Yeah, the whole injector solution, because you’re</p>
<p>368<br>00:41:38,700 –&gt; 00:41:45,660<br>out, don’t have a real solution. Okay. Thanks. So what stops an attacker from just constantly</p>
<p>369<br>00:41:45,659 –&gt; 00:41:50,539<br>flooding the network with wrong solutions? Yeah, they’re not a search attack. And hopefully,</p>
<p>370<br>00:41:50,539 –&gt; 00:41:56,859<br>they did one of the turns out that the checking solution is very easy. Right. And so it’s easy to</p>
<p>371<br>00:41:56,859 –&gt; 00:42:05,659<br>quickly reject an incorrect solution. Thank you. And how are the timestamps determined due,</p>
<p>372<br>00:42:05,659 –&gt; 00:42:10,779<br>like does each block set the timestamp on its own? Yeah. Now, the minor that successfully</p>
<p>373<br>00:42:10,780 –&gt; 00:42:18,780<br>minds can set some timestamp in the block. And what if they just set the timestamp to be, like,</p>
<p>374<br>00:42:18,780 –&gt; 00:42:23,340<br>longer than it took so that it becomes less difficult? Well, they can’t lie too much.</p>
<p>375<br>00:42:23,340 –&gt; 00:42:27,500<br>Great. Like, they have a 10 minute window sort of roughly to why I don’t really know exactly how</p>
<p>376<br>00:42:27,500 –&gt; 00:42:32,620<br>the timestamp is checked. I don’t know them. By dimension with this solvable.</p>
<p>377<br>00:42:34,940 –&gt; 00:42:40,460<br>Okay. Piers get like to the transactions that want to be appended to the block.</p>
<p>378<br>00:42:41,500 –&gt; 00:42:47,019<br>Thank you. That’s the next one. So, so blocks and transactions.</p>
<p>379<br>00:42:57,580 –&gt; 00:43:02,300<br>So let’s assume, like, there’s some, you know, block B5 that already has been computed.</p>
<p>380<br>00:43:02,860 –&gt; 00:43:09,260<br>That sits in the log, you know, points for every two B4. And so we’re a minor.</p>
<p>381<br>00:43:09,900 –&gt; 00:43:16,220<br>We’re working on, you know, we got a blog with, you know, that is sort of we’re reminding on. So,</p>
<p>382<br>00:43:16,220 –&gt; 00:43:22,780<br>it has a bunch of transactions. And we’re basically, you know, trying to compute, you know,</p>
<p>383<br>00:43:22,780 –&gt; 00:43:29,100<br>the solution to this puzzle. And so new transactions come in, right? They arrive. And so the new</p>
<p>384<br>00:43:29,100 –&gt; 00:43:33,580<br>transactions actually, you know, they called a memory buffer buffer. They’re going to some buffer.</p>
<p>385<br>00:43:33,659 –&gt; 00:43:43,019<br>And basically, they’re going to, when the next walk, there will be some point. This guy,</p>
<p>386<br>00:43:43,019 –&gt; 00:43:50,219<br>you know, let’s say this is one minor. So let’s say minor, I was the lucky one, you know, actually,</p>
<p>387<br>00:43:51,900 –&gt; 00:43:59,420<br>minor, I compute, you know, the new B6. And so at some point, B6 is the new</p>
<p>388<br>00:44:00,220 –&gt; 00:44:06,940<br>next head of the log, you know, which contains a bunch of transactions. And so while, you know,</p>
<p>389<br>00:44:06,940 –&gt; 00:44:11,420<br>sort of minor, I was actually trying to hash, you know, computing many, many, many,</p>
<p>390<br>00:44:11,420 –&gt; 00:44:17,420<br>hashers directly solve the puzzle. New transactions come in. And so soon, as the minor, I</p>
<p>391<br>00:44:17,420 –&gt; 00:44:22,460<br>is done, you know, with B6, it basically selects, you know, the number of transactions,</p>
<p>392<br>00:44:22,460 –&gt; 00:44:26,300<br>puts a new block together, a partial block. It’s not the one that is solved yet.</p>
<p>393<br>00:44:27,100 –&gt; 00:44:31,740<br>You know, the transaction is in from the pool, you know, whatever updates, you know, whatever</p>
<p>394<br>00:44:31,740 –&gt; 00:44:36,780<br>an engine engine needs to be updated. And then start hatching on that one. And hoping to solve it</p>
<p>395<br>00:44:36,780 –&gt; 00:44:40,860<br>so that that can be added, you know, to the transaction log. And some point later, if it succeeds.</p>
<p>396<br>00:44:41,740 –&gt; 00:44:48,380<br>Of course, if somebody else succeeds in solving the producing B7 before minor, I, you know,</p>
<p>397<br>00:44:48,380 –&gt; 00:44:54,060<br>minor, I was going to switch, you know, to the B7 of that block, remove any transactions that</p>
<p>398<br>00:44:54,059 –&gt; 00:44:59,019<br>ended up already in B7 and continue with the transaction that are left and are not in B7 yet.</p>
<p>399<br>00:45:01,179 –&gt; 00:45:07,259<br>Okay, so that’s sort of the plan for how transactions of blogs interact</p>
<p>400<br>00:45:08,940 –&gt; 00:45:09,659<br>than I love them.</p>
<p>401<br>00:45:12,460 –&gt; 00:45:20,860<br>So as transactions come in, like, you know, you’re trying to calculate the non-serve block,</p>
<p>402<br>00:45:21,820 –&gt; 00:45:28,860<br>that’ll give you, you know, end-leaking zeros. New transactions will come in, right?</p>
<p>403<br>00:45:28,860 –&gt; 00:45:29,660<br>As you can see.</p>
<p>404<br>00:45:29,660 –&gt; 00:45:33,660<br>They’re not part of that block. They’re not going to be sitting on the site, therefore the next block.</p>
<p>405<br>00:45:34,300 –&gt; 00:45:40,860<br>Okay. Could you, could you add, could you add them to the block?</p>
<p>406<br>00:45:40,860 –&gt; 00:45:41,740<br>No, it changed the hatch.</p>
<p>407<br>00:45:43,099 –&gt; 00:45:48,860<br>Right. But I mean, you just need to keep trying to get like a valid non-s, right?</p>
<p>408<br>00:45:49,340 –&gt; 00:45:53,099<br>You also have, there’s a limit on the block size, you know, the block size can’t be bigger than one</p>
<p>409<br>00:45:53,099 –&gt; 00:45:58,460<br>of the one, one some particular predefined consulate by the protocol. You know, there’s a bunch of</p>
<p>410<br>00:45:58,460 –&gt; 00:46:02,300<br>other reasons, you know, once you’re filled up the blog, you know, with your transactions, you</p>
<p>411<br>00:46:02,300 –&gt; 00:46:05,099<br>keep going, and passing until, you know, you find the solution.</p>
<p>412<br>00:46:05,099 –&gt; 00:46:06,059<br>Okay.</p>
<p>413<br>00:46:07,180 –&gt; 00:46:12,220<br>Or, or you get, or you receive a new one and then you reject and you go work on the next one.</p>
<p>414<br>00:46:12,620 –&gt; 00:46:13,019<br>Okay.</p>
<p>415<br>00:46:15,180 –&gt; 00:46:15,420<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>416<br>00:46:16,380 –&gt; 00:46:23,500<br>So when, when someone, when a minor like loses, and do they like, I guess it’s possible for a</p>
<p>417<br>00:46:23,500 –&gt; 00:46:28,380<br>minor never to make profit out of this because they keep like losing because they have no</p>
<p>418<br>00:46:28,380 –&gt; 00:46:28,860<br>competitors.</p>
<p>419<br>00:46:28,860 –&gt; 00:46:33,980<br>Yeah, absolutely. If, if I would start mining with my laptop, I’m pretty sure I would make no money.</p>
<p>420<br>00:46:37,099 –&gt; 00:46:39,980<br>And the transaction pool, it is local?</p>
<p>421<br>00:46:40,940 –&gt; 00:46:46,460<br>Yeah, every, every note maintains this transaction pool, where as they receive transactions from</p>
<p>422<br>00:46:48,860 –&gt; 00:46:52,619<br>from other notes in the network, you know, they keep that transaction pool and, you know,</p>
<p>423<br>00:46:52,619 –&gt; 00:46:55,579<br>they use that transaction pool basically to fill the next block.</p>
<p>424<br>00:46:57,420 –&gt; 00:46:58,219<br>So you want to tell me?</p>
<p>425<br>00:46:58,219 –&gt; 00:47:02,539<br>In all kinds of rules, you know, and how you select transactions, which I’m not going to talk about.</p>
<p>426<br>00:47:02,940 –&gt; 00:47:03,260<br>Okay.</p>
<p>427<br>00:47:03,900 –&gt; 00:47:06,460<br>So to a pen, you need to tell your transaction to everyone.</p>
<p>428<br>00:47:07,820 –&gt; 00:47:08,139<br>Yes.</p>
<p>429<br>00:47:08,940 –&gt; 00:47:14,299<br>Or you, you tell a bunch of peers and they will flood it for the rest of you to the rest of the network.</p>
<p>430<br>00:47:17,099 –&gt; 00:47:24,699<br>Oh, so for my understanding, when a minor successfully mines or verifies a transaction,</p>
<p>431<br>00:47:25,500 –&gt; 00:47:27,659<br>they get rewarded.</p>
<p>432<br>00:47:27,659 –&gt; 00:47:27,980<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>433<br>00:47:27,980 –&gt; 00:47:33,659<br>As they did this verification, but they can also lie when it comes to the timestamp.</p>
<p>434<br>00:47:33,659 –&gt; 00:47:37,420<br>So let’s say that you have two verifiers and they’re both working on the same block.</p>
<p>435<br>00:47:37,420 –&gt; 00:47:41,260<br>And they almost simultaneously verify at the same time.</p>
<p>436<br>00:47:41,260 –&gt; 00:47:47,099<br>But one of them was, you know, they lied and they made the timestamp a bit earlier.</p>
<p>437<br>00:47:47,900 –&gt; 00:47:52,619<br>So kind of they, but there’s difficulties chosen for a period of time.</p>
<p>438<br>00:47:52,619 –&gt; 00:47:56,940<br>Like for the next like 20, you know, as a whole bunch of years of block, it only changes periodically.</p>
<p>439<br>00:47:57,420 –&gt; 00:47:58,860<br>You can’t change it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>440<br>00:47:59,820 –&gt; 00:48:02,300<br>So what that, I’m sorry, I think I missed that one.</p>
<p>441<br>00:48:02,860 –&gt; 00:48:06,300<br>The difficulty is not changed on every block.</p>
<p>442<br>00:48:07,180 –&gt; 00:48:11,740<br>It is periodically changed after some number of blocks have been computed.</p>
<p>443<br>00:48:12,460 –&gt; 00:48:14,220<br>And so, you know, it’s done in the back.</p>
<p>444<br>00:48:14,220 –&gt; 00:48:16,460<br>You know, everybody can see what these timestamps are.</p>
<p>445<br>00:48:16,460 –&gt; 00:48:20,620<br>You know, every, I think it’s every, I forgot what that exact number of blocks is.</p>
<p>446<br>00:48:20,620 –&gt; 00:48:24,300<br>Where when, you know, the difficulty is adjusted.</p>
<p>447<br>00:48:25,180 –&gt; 00:48:25,500<br>I see.</p>
<p>448<br>00:48:26,220 –&gt; 00:48:26,460<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>449<br>00:48:27,900 –&gt; 00:48:30,700<br>So at that point, you already agreed on all those blogs in the past.</p>
<p>450<br>00:48:30,779 –&gt; 00:48:32,539<br>So everybody’s on agreement of like what the</p>
<p>451<br>00:48:33,419 –&gt; 00:48:37,259<br>timestamps are that we’re going to actually use to actually compute a new, a, a valid block.</p>
<p>452<br>00:48:39,579 –&gt; 00:48:46,779<br>Um, so, so I had, I had one, um, one question about, um, like achieving consensus.</p>
<p>453<br>00:48:46,779 –&gt; 00:48:52,779<br>I guess like all of this like relies on like pretty much every node running</p>
<p>454<br>00:48:53,659 –&gt; 00:48:54,699<br>the same code, right?</p>
<p>455<br>00:48:54,699 –&gt; 00:48:58,859<br>Or are these following the, the rules vary very precisely.</p>
<p>456<br>00:48:58,940 –&gt; 00:48:59,500<br>Yep.</p>
<p>457<br>00:48:59,500 –&gt; 00:49:03,180<br>Like what happens if there’s a bug in like my code and the code that I’m running,</p>
<p>458<br>00:49:03,820 –&gt; 00:49:07,900<br>um, and you know, maybe cut a bug in like a bunch of different nodes.</p>
<p>459<br>00:49:09,660 –&gt; 00:49:14,539<br>Does that like throw off like, like all like notions of like consistency potentially?</p>
<p>460<br>00:49:15,579 –&gt; 00:49:19,740<br>Well, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, as long as the majority is, we’ll talk a little bit more about it.</p>
<p>461<br>00:49:19,740 –&gt; 00:49:23,260<br>I think there’s a majority of the nodes, I think the right, the runs the right code, you know,</p>
<p>462<br>00:49:23,260 –&gt; 00:49:24,539<br>I have to make some work out.</p>
<p>463<br>00:49:24,539 –&gt; 00:49:24,700<br>Right.</p>
<p>464<br>00:49:25,019 –&gt; 00:49:29,659<br>But like if there’s a trap door in the code, yeah, you got a problem.</p>
<p>465<br>00:49:29,659 –&gt; 00:49:31,899<br>Like if there’s a trap or in Linux, you got a problem too.</p>
<p>466<br>00:49:33,899 –&gt; 00:49:39,179<br>So, so do, does every node run like the same code or are there different?</p>
<p>467<br>00:49:39,179 –&gt; 00:49:41,659<br>No, there are a couple of different bitcoins versions around.</p>
<p>468<br>00:49:41,659 –&gt; 00:49:43,259<br>We’ll talk a little bit more about it in a second.</p>
<p>469<br>00:49:43,259 –&gt; 00:49:48,379<br>Uh, but there are, uh, so the main, you know, core, uh, they’re called, you know,</p>
<p>470<br>00:49:48,379 –&gt; 00:49:52,139<br>and they’re like, it’s like an open source project and like, like, Linux is, you know,</p>
<p>471<br>00:49:52,139 –&gt; 00:49:55,500<br>has maintainers and, you know, code review, I know all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>472<br>00:49:56,859 –&gt; 00:50:01,019<br>And most of the, like, the wallets and most of the sort of the, uh, appears will run,</p>
<p>473<br>00:50:01,019 –&gt; 00:50:03,659<br>they know, one of the, the standardized version basically.</p>
<p>474<br>00:50:04,699 –&gt; 00:50:06,699<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>475<br>00:50:11,339 –&gt; 00:50:12,139<br>Uh, okay, forked.</p>
<p>476<br>00:50:13,819 –&gt; 00:50:20,460<br>So, uh, so we know now, like, what the rule is, you know, who can actually extend, uh, the,</p>
<p>477<br>00:50:20,460 –&gt; 00:50:24,380<br>the log, uh, or the chain, the blockchain, you can still have forks.</p>
<p>478<br>00:50:25,179 –&gt; 00:50:27,099<br>Okay, because you know, there’s a new chart chain,</p>
<p>479<br>00:50:27,980 –&gt; 00:50:30,940<br>you know, we’re B5, you know, B6.</p>
<p>480<br>00:50:31,659 –&gt; 00:50:35,260<br>And you know, we, you know, somebody who to do might actually guess, sort of lucky,</p>
<p>481<br>00:50:35,260 –&gt; 00:50:39,019<br>and so roughly compute is going to be seven, you know, two B7s at the same time.</p>
<p>482<br>00:50:39,019 –&gt; 00:50:43,500<br>So, can you, we got B7 prime, and here we got B7 double prime.</p>
<p>483<br>00:50:45,980 –&gt; 00:50:48,539<br>Uh, and that would be problematic for us, right?</p>
<p>484<br>00:50:48,619 –&gt; 00:50:54,460<br>Because maybe, you know, one of these, this chain, uh, has the dissection, you know, the,</p>
<p>485<br>00:50:54,460 –&gt; 00:50:56,860<br>the Y2, whatever it’s Y2Z.</p>
<p>486<br>00:50:57,980 –&gt; 00:51:00,139<br>Yeah, and maybe this one has the Y2Q.</p>
<p>487<br>00:51:02,300 –&gt; 00:51:06,059<br>So I can, you know, we’re on a sort of mature that we actually settle in the end of one chain.</p>
<p>488<br>00:51:06,860 –&gt; 00:51:09,420<br>You know, so there’s two reasons that are why these chains might develop.</p>
<p>489<br>00:51:10,059 –&gt; 00:51:15,579<br>You know, one is, you know, the, people or participants find, uh, the,</p>
<p>490<br>00:51:15,579 –&gt; 00:51:18,539<br>uh, find the non-s at the same time.</p>
<p>491<br>00:51:22,460 –&gt; 00:51:23,659<br>Or roughly at the same time.</p>
<p>492<br>00:51:24,380 –&gt; 00:51:27,500<br>And the second one is that, you know, there may be slow networks.</p>
<p>493<br>00:51:30,860 –&gt; 00:51:35,980<br>And so, you know, up here might receive, you know, from two nodes that are in different ends of</p>
<p>494<br>00:51:35,980 –&gt; 00:51:38,139<br>the network, at some point, these two new solutions.</p>
<p>495<br>00:51:39,179 –&gt; 00:51:43,819<br>Um, and basically, you know, when a node ends up in this situation,</p>
<p>496<br>00:51:43,820 –&gt; 00:51:49,740<br>basically does not, and usually keeps the fork around and just waits to see which fork gets extended.</p>
<p>497<br>00:51:50,300 –&gt; 00:51:54,460<br>And so, you know, maybe this fork, the bottom one, you know, will get extended with, you know,</p>
<p>498<br>00:51:54,460 –&gt; 00:51:59,740<br>B8. And then the rules very simple, uh, you know, the piers switches,</p>
<p>499<br>00:52:04,220 –&gt; 00:52:05,500<br>switches to the longest fork.</p>
<p>500<br>00:52:05,820 –&gt; 00:52:17,099<br>And, uh, and so, uh, and so we’re basically, you know, all the designations, you know,</p>
<p>501<br>00:52:17,099 –&gt; 00:52:21,739<br>that might have learned about the, this fork, in the top fork, I’m just going to disappear.</p>
<p>502<br>00:52:21,739 –&gt; 00:52:26,539<br>You know, there’s going to not matter in the, the system, uh, because in the end, you know,</p>
<p>503<br>00:52:26,539 –&gt; 00:52:30,059<br>all those sort of good nodes, a little actually agree on the longest chain.</p>
<p>504<br>00:52:30,059 –&gt; 00:52:33,739<br>And, you know, basically proceed, you know, mining along the longest chain.</p>
<p>505<br>00:52:34,699 –&gt; 00:52:40,539<br>That’s the basic plan. And so let’s look a little bit about like how would that solve our double,</p>
<p>506<br>00:52:40,539 –&gt; 00:52:46,859<br>double spending problem? Wait, I have a question on the obvious slide.</p>
<p>507<br>00:52:47,500 –&gt; 00:52:50,059<br>Yep, I’m going to continue on the previous slide in this slide.</p>
<p>508<br>00:52:50,059 –&gt; 00:52:53,899<br>But okay, so, um, but, but, man, that’s the question. So,</p>
<p>509<br>00:52:54,859 –&gt; 00:53:02,699<br>so, even if the, in the, in the second cause, like the slow network, can you, um, detect that if</p>
<p>510<br>00:53:02,779 –&gt; 00:53:07,659<br>you’re using, if the miner included the timestamp where they, when they found the solution?</p>
<p>511<br>00:53:09,019 –&gt; 00:53:15,419<br>Uh, okay. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you might get</p>
<p>512<br>00:53:15,419 –&gt; 00:53:19,659<br>already be suspicious or may agree on what actually the next, you know, what the right problem,</p>
<p>513<br>00:53:19,659 –&gt; 00:53:23,819<br>the right chain is, but it will be confirmed later by future blocks.</p>
<p>514<br>00:53:24,859 –&gt; 00:53:28,139<br>And, you know, you use the future blocks that we really decide what’s the longest chain is.</p>
<p>515<br>00:53:28,139 –&gt; 00:53:30,139<br>Okay.</p>
<p>516<br>00:53:30,139 –&gt; 00:53:32,139<br>Okay.</p>
<p>517<br>00:53:32,139 –&gt; 00:53:34,139<br>Okay.</p>
<p>518<br>00:53:34,139 –&gt; 00:53:36,139<br>Double spinning.</p>
<p>519<br>00:53:36,139 –&gt; 00:53:40,139<br>So let’s talk about sort of two easy two cases.</p>
<p>520<br>00:53:40,139 –&gt; 00:53:42,139<br>The first one is easy.</p>
<p>521<br>00:53:42,139 –&gt; 00:53:46,139<br>You know, why, you know, sense.</p>
<p>522<br>00:53:46,139 –&gt; 00:53:48,139<br>You know, the why to Z.</p>
<p>523<br>00:53:48,139 –&gt; 00:53:51,139<br>And why to Q.</p>
<p>524<br>00:53:51,139 –&gt; 00:53:55,139<br>To some peer or to the peers.</p>
<p>525<br>00:53:55,139 –&gt; 00:54:01,139<br>And basically what will happen quick in this case is that if it’s a well behaving peer, you’ll see like, hey, you know, two transactions.</p>
<p>526<br>00:54:01,139 –&gt; 00:54:04,139<br>That actually spent the same money.</p>
<p>527<br>00:54:04,139 –&gt; 00:54:05,139<br>Twice.</p>
<p>528<br>00:54:05,139 –&gt; 00:54:07,139<br>I’m just going to reject that.</p>
<p>529<br>00:54:07,139 –&gt; 00:54:12,139<br>So appeared up to use, you know, is trying to go or minor, that it’s going to construct a blog.</p>
<p>530<br>00:54:12,139 –&gt; 00:54:16,139<br>You know, we’ll actually validate all the transactions before they stick them in the blog.</p>
<p>531<br>00:54:16,139 –&gt; 00:54:24,139<br>So this will, you know, don’t really, this is not going to work. My name is going to reject. Good minor.</p>
<p>532<br>00:54:24,139 –&gt; 00:54:30,139<br>Okay. The second question, the more interesting thing that in cases, basically, why, since.</p>
<p>533<br>00:54:30,139 –&gt; 00:54:32,139<br>You know, why to Z.</p>
<p>534<br>00:54:32,139 –&gt; 00:54:36,139<br>You know, to some set of the peers.</p>
<p>535<br>00:54:36,139 –&gt; 00:54:39,139<br>And, you know, why to Q.</p>
<p>536<br>00:54:39,139 –&gt; 00:54:47,139<br>To another set of peers.</p>
<p>537<br>00:54:47,139 –&gt; 00:54:55,139<br>And you know, we, and, and my, you know, maybe, you know, the, maybe one pool is bigger than the other pool.</p>
<p>538<br>00:54:55,139 –&gt; 00:54:59,139<br>But the crew actually end up in the situation where basically, you know, we got the chain.</p>
<p>539<br>00:54:59,139 –&gt; 00:55:01,139<br>Okay. So before.</p>
<p>540<br>00:55:01,139 –&gt; 00:55:05,139<br>And basically, there are one set of peers, you know, computes.</p>
<p>541<br>00:55:05,139 –&gt; 00:55:09,139<br>You know, the hash where that includes why to Q.</p>
<p>542<br>00:55:09,139 –&gt; 00:55:14,139<br>And the other one computes a block, you know, actually contains why to Z.</p>
<p>543<br>00:55:14,139 –&gt; 00:55:17,139<br>And so this looks like a double spending thing.</p>
<p>544<br>00:55:17,139 –&gt; 00:55:25,139<br>And so if you’re Z, quick, like, two years, the version that there’s going to decide whether to accept, you know, this transaction and hand out of the.</p>
<p>545<br>00:55:25,139 –&gt; 00:55:26,139<br>Hand out the latte.</p>
<p>546<br>00:55:26,139 –&gt; 00:55:29,139<br>What you do is you’re going to wait.</p>
<p>547<br>00:55:29,139 –&gt; 00:55:31,139<br>And you’re going to wait until.</p>
<p>548<br>00:55:31,139 –&gt; 00:55:34,139<br>There’s a bunch of more blocks that are behind it.</p>
<p>549<br>00:55:34,139 –&gt; 00:55:37,139<br>So typically it’s five six up to five six.</p>
<p>550<br>00:55:37,139 –&gt; 00:55:41,139<br>You know, for a better available transaction, maybe not for a latte, but if you’re buying a car.</p>
<p>551<br>00:55:41,139 –&gt; 00:55:45,139<br>You know, you really want to make them sure that you’re going to get your money.</p>
<p>552<br>00:55:45,139 –&gt; 00:55:49,139<br>And that, you know, why didn’t double spend the money.</p>
<p>553<br>00:55:49,139 –&gt; 00:55:51,139<br>And so.</p>
<p>554<br>00:55:51,139 –&gt; 00:55:54,139<br>You may work in a way for a while.</p>
<p>555<br>00:55:54,139 –&gt; 00:56:00,139<br>Until new hatch. I mean, end it to a new block, so be extended to the blockchain.</p>
<p>556<br>00:56:00,139 –&gt; 00:56:04,139<br>And you know, I want you to five or six.</p>
<p>557<br>00:56:04,139 –&gt; 00:56:06,139<br>And that’s the paper, but some calculations.</p>
<p>558<br>00:56:06,139 –&gt; 00:56:07,139<br>You can be pretty confident.</p>
<p>559<br>00:56:07,139 –&gt; 00:56:10,139<br>Very confident that.</p>
<p>560<br>00:56:10,139 –&gt; 00:56:18,139<br>It’s unlikely, you know, for a attacker to basically compute a new chain and sort of overtake, you know, the longer chain.</p>
<p>561<br>00:56:18,139 –&gt; 00:56:20,139<br>Right. Let’s say this is the attacker.</p>
<p>562<br>00:56:20,139 –&gt; 00:56:28,139<br>The attacker has less computational power, you know, presumably, you know, this is the assumption behind this whole paper and has less computational power to know the good people.</p>
<p>563<br>00:56:28,139 –&gt; 00:56:31,139<br>And so the good people have more computational power.</p>
<p>564<br>00:56:31,139 –&gt; 00:56:36,139<br>It’s going to be impossible for the attacker or unlikely or.</p>
<p>565<br>00:56:36,139 –&gt; 00:56:45,139<br>Then the ledges will be impossible or unlikely for the attacker to basically compute faster and actually make a chain that’s longer than the good chain.</p>
<p>566<br>00:56:45,139 –&gt; 00:56:49,139<br>So that’s sort of the key assumption that’s behind all this.</p>
<p>567<br>00:56:49,139 –&gt; 00:56:54,139<br>Among this reason, among this reason reason.</p>
<p>568<br>00:56:54,139 –&gt; 00:57:11,139<br>So you know, just has to wait for a while until the good guys like extended the chain long enough that you know the Z is completely convinced that you know, impossible for a set of attackers to actually out compute, you know, the good people.</p>
<p>569<br>00:57:11,139 –&gt; 00:57:16,139<br>And at that point, you know, the Z can just accept the transaction and say like, oh, this is legit injection.</p>
<p>570<br>00:57:16,139 –&gt; 00:57:26,139<br>If everything else checks out and hand over the latte or the car, you know, to to see or to the why I guess.</p>
<p>571<br>00:57:26,139 –&gt; 00:57:31,139<br>Sorry, good question. Who distributes the puzzles.</p>
<p>572<br>00:57:31,139 –&gt; 00:57:37,139<br>There’s no distribution deposits necessary, right?</p>
<p>573<br>00:57:37,139 –&gt; 00:57:49,139<br>The puzzle is, you know, predetermined, you know, the puzzle is you have to compute a hash over the block that has enough leading zeros.</p>
<p>574<br>00:57:49,139 –&gt; 00:57:59,139<br>So there’s no distribution or deposit, no thing that’s distributed. Maybe it’s the difficulty, but as we talked a little bit earlier, that sort of adjusted over time in a two minutes to go away.</p>
<p>575<br>00:57:59,139 –&gt; 00:58:01,139<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>576<br>00:58:01,139 –&gt; 00:58:10,139<br>So there’s all these transactions that are happening and then through some gossip protocol or something, the transactions distributed to all the nodes.</p>
<p>577<br>00:58:10,139 –&gt; 00:58:21,139<br>And then somehow there’s agreement on what set of transactions are packaged into a block. So everyone has agreement on what the block is.</p>
<p>578<br>00:58:21,139 –&gt; 00:58:28,139<br>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the minor received transactions, right?</p>
<p>579<br>00:58:28,139 –&gt; 00:58:33,139<br>But we hear where was it.</p>
<p>580<br>00:58:33,139 –&gt; 00:58:38,139<br>Blocked over some slide. I think the next one.</p>
<p>581<br>00:58:38,139 –&gt; 00:58:47,139<br>Yeah, blocks and transactions. So the minor, mainly minor, I, you know, use received transactions over the network and it just decides which transactions go in that block.</p>
<p>582<br>00:58:47,139 –&gt; 00:58:53,139<br>And if it starts computing and if it wins, that is the transaction that going that block.</p>
<p>583<br>00:58:53,139 –&gt; 00:59:03,139<br>So that determines that the total order, right? You know, the total order is determined by all the previous blocks can upwash this new block and within the block, you know, basically a minor eye is decided what goes in.</p>
<p>584<br>00:59:03,139 –&gt; 00:59:11,139<br>There’s some complicated rules that you know, minor should supposed to follow, but you know, basically the minor gets to this side.</p>
<p>585<br>00:59:11,139 –&gt; 00:59:16,139<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>586<br>00:59:16,139 –&gt; 00:59:21,139<br>And there’s some incentive systems for the miners to do the right thing.</p>
<p>587<br>00:59:21,139 –&gt; 00:59:24,139<br>So let me talk a little bit about this.</p>
<p>588<br>00:59:24,139 –&gt; 00:59:36,139<br>So so far, you know, we’re seeing the disposal of that sort of the core, this proven work idea to is that’s the core of actually achieving consensus.</p>
<p>589<br>00:59:36,139 –&gt; 00:59:40,139<br>But you know, this requires the miners actually to quite a bit of work.</p>
<p>590<br>00:59:40,139 –&gt; 00:59:44,139<br>Like they have to hash, hash, hash, have to have to say, here’s computer.</p>
<p>591<br>00:59:44,139 –&gt; 00:59:47,139<br>It’s one one. These are roughly a month of work, right?</p>
<p>592<br>00:59:47,139 –&gt; 01:00:03,139<br>And so why wouldn’t minor do that? And so there’s an incentive system for to encourage miners to actually play this role.</p>
<p>593<br>01:00:03,139 –&gt; 01:00:14,139<br>You know, there’s a rule that basically the, there’s a bunch of sort of Bitcoin reserved in the pool, like when the refers bits, you know, Bitcoin transaction versus created.</p>
<p>594<br>01:00:14,139 –&gt; 01:00:23,139<br>And miners get paid or rewarded out of that pool. And so basically the first transaction.</p>
<p>595<br>01:00:23,139 –&gt; 01:00:33,139<br>And the first transaction in the blog is basically reward for the minor.</p>
<p>596<br>01:00:33,139 –&gt; 01:00:49,139<br>And so basically the minor can insert an transaction in the first of the contours and transaction first slot where that basically lists, you know, the miners public key and transferring money out of the cool to himself.</p>
<p>597<br>01:00:49,139 –&gt; 01:01:00,139<br>And that was the way the miners get actually get named the lead sort of return or reward for actually the work they do.</p>
<p>598<br>01:01:00,139 –&gt; 01:01:10,139<br>That reward changes over time. Currently, I think you know, for today is I think it’s 6.25, you know, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>599<br>01:01:10,139 –&gt; 01:01:24,139<br>To actually mind a block. But this is changing over time. It actually has sort of a half-ing rule that reduces, you know, half the like a couple years ago, which is 12 bit at 12.5 Bitcoin.</p>
<p>600<br>01:01:24,139 –&gt; 01:01:37,139<br>And in a while will be whatever free point, you know, whatever the half of 6.25. And I think I remember correctly every two and every two under 10,000 blocks that number halves.</p>
<p>601<br>01:01:37,139 –&gt; 01:01:49,139<br>It’s until it runs into the most finest, you know, the finest Bitcoin denominator. And then it basically stops.</p>
<p>602<br>01:01:49,139 –&gt; 01:02:00,139<br>But we’re a while away before that actually is the case. If that happens, then the idea is that, you know, to mine actually block every transaction page a little fee.</p>
<p>603<br>01:02:00,139 –&gt; 01:02:09,139<br>And the minor collects the fees, you know, from all the transactions in the block and use and reward the minor with those fees.</p>
<p>604<br>01:02:09,139 –&gt; 01:02:17,139<br>Even now there are some fees. But to make sure that basically the transaction on a frivolous.</p>
<p>605<br>01:02:17,139 –&gt; 01:02:32,139<br>And so really the minor actually earns not only the 6.25, but also like the fees that actually spend the fees that actually go along with the transactions.</p>
<p>606<br>01:02:32,139 –&gt; 01:02:45,139<br>And so this is, as the minor incentive in Bitcoin has gotten so successful that basically there’s sort of an arms range in minor.</p>
<p>607<br>01:02:45,139 –&gt; 01:02:57,139<br>And this is like, for example, why, you know, if I were to want to participate and actually win and make some money, I’m going to lose the, the series minors are much better at computing.</p>
<p>608<br>01:02:57,139 –&gt; 01:03:03,139<br>And then you have to have a hash that at a very high rate. Then, you know, you’re standing left up.</p>
<p>609<br>01:03:03,139 –&gt; 01:03:14,139<br>And so there’s a couple of things that actually going on in this arms race. First of all, the minor form pools.</p>
<p>610<br>01:03:14,139 –&gt; 01:03:23,139<br>So the basic idea is that the minor collaborate with each other and they share the revenue with each other. And so like, you know, if you’re pooled with many, many, many notes.</p>
<p>611<br>01:03:23,139 –&gt; 01:03:31,139<br>From different people, many computers from different people, the, you know, the people can share sort of the revenue stream out of mining.</p>
<p>612<br>01:03:31,139 –&gt; 01:03:37,139<br>Because they do that so cool. You know, they’re more likely to actually win at once in a while.</p>
<p>613<br>01:03:37,139 –&gt; 01:03:49,139<br>And, you know, of course, probabilistically, they have some chance to win. And basically, you know, spread sort of the income stream in a more stable form across all the miners in the single pool.</p>
<p>614<br>01:03:49,139 –&gt; 01:04:06,139<br>And if you look online today, there are some really large pools. And I think like the free biggest pools contribute, contribute more than 50%, you know, sort of the mining power.</p>
<p>615<br>01:04:06,139 –&gt; 01:04:17,139<br>Sorry. Why is this why you said that each block takes like around 10 minutes to mine even though it takes a month of CPU power.</p>
<p>616<br>01:04:17,139 –&gt; 01:04:29,139<br>But yeah, on average is a month, but you’re going to have to walk you know, you pick the norms, you know, you can get lucky and actually pick a non that actually allows you to solve the problem much quicker.</p>
<p>617<br>01:04:29,139 –&gt; 01:04:44,139<br>Right. There’s always some probability that nonsense some some big number work. And if you pick the right number, you know, you can get lucky and if many, many, many miners do that, there’s actually a chance that you don’t take much less than a month.</p>
<p>618<br>01:04:44,139 –&gt; 01:04:47,139<br>And in fact, that’s why where the 10 minutes comes from.</p>
<p>619<br>01:04:47,139 –&gt; 01:04:57,139<br>Wait, so is the month more important than 10 minutes more important because it like if there was only one miner, right, I’m the expect that is one month you.</p>
<p>620<br>01:04:57,139 –&gt; 01:04:59,139<br>On average, you would take one month, right?</p>
<p>621<br>01:04:59,139 –&gt; 01:05:02,139<br>Yeah, but the assumption is there many, many miners.</p>
<p>622<br>01:05:02,139 –&gt; 01:05:08,139<br>But what what what in it like very like if there’s a lot more minor miners.</p>
<p>623<br>01:05:08,139 –&gt; 01:05:13,139<br>There’s a lot of variation, but on average is 10 minutes.</p>
<p>624<br>01:05:13,139 –&gt; 01:05:17,139<br>So it’s picked that is on average, it comes out to be 10 minutes.</p>
<p>625<br>01:05:17,139 –&gt; 01:05:18,139<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>626<br>01:05:18,139 –&gt; 01:05:23,139<br>Is there ever possible that like a puzzle is impossible?</p>
<p>627<br>01:05:23,139 –&gt; 01:05:29,139<br>Uh, no, I don’t think so. You may take a long time.</p>
<p>628<br>01:05:29,139 –&gt; 01:05:34,139<br>There is going to be a.</p>
<p>629<br>01:05:34,139 –&gt; 01:05:37,139<br>There’s going to be you get to pick the nonsense, correct?</p>
<p>630<br>01:05:37,139 –&gt; 01:05:47,139<br>And you know, there’s going to be a case where the hash is going to fall, you know, within the in leading zeros.</p>
<p>631<br>01:05:47,139 –&gt; 01:05:54,139<br>I’m so like how so since the value of Bitcoin is actually very, let’s say volatile.</p>
<p>632<br>01:05:54,139 –&gt; 01:05:56,139<br>Yes.</p>
<p>633<br>01:05:56,139 –&gt; 01:06:03,139<br>And so then like how can we actually ensure that the incentive system for the miners is still adequate to keep this thing going for the future?</p>
<p>634<br>01:06:03,139 –&gt; 01:06:09,139<br>I mean, since the number of like since like the reward is pre determined, let’s say to be 6.25, pick points.</p>
<p>635<br>01:06:09,139 –&gt; 01:06:15,139<br>What if for some reason the Bitcoin value just dropped and then the incentive is not good enough for the miners and so just they just.</p>
<p>636<br>01:06:15,139 –&gt; 01:06:18,139<br>Yeah, you know, like there’s roughly no value for miners to do this.</p>
<p>637<br>01:06:18,139 –&gt; 01:06:21,139<br>Then you know, the Bitcoin network of collapse.</p>
<p>638<br>01:06:21,139 –&gt; 01:06:26,139<br>And presumably the way this is going to work out is that the transaction fee is going to go up.</p>
<p>639<br>01:06:26,139 –&gt; 01:06:32,139<br>But then if the transaction fees go up, then it will it will be a counter incentive for people who.</p>
<p>640<br>01:06:32,139 –&gt; 01:06:40,139<br>Yeah, but like everybody’s on the Bitcoin network, you know, you want to trade goods, you know, you have to deal with somebody on the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>641<br>01:06:40,139 –&gt; 01:06:48,139<br>So there’s all kinds of sort of company completed analysis that I’m not going to like predict on like what is going to be the outcome.</p>
<p>642<br>01:06:48,139 –&gt; 01:06:49,139<br>That’s OK.</p>
<p>643<br>01:06:49,139 –&gt; 01:06:58,139<br>I guess we’ve seen two 2140 and that’s sort of the point where I think the reward system runs out and it’s going to be all based on transaction fees.</p>
<p>644<br>01:06:58,139 –&gt; 01:07:00,139<br>And we have the current rate.</p>
<p>645<br>01:07:00,139 –&gt; 01:07:09,139<br>OK, so the other thing that’s going on is, you know, people build special hardware.</p>
<p>646<br>01:07:09,139 –&gt; 01:07:14,139<br>You know, their companies that you know, delivery you boards, you know, that are really good at fast and hashing.</p>
<p>647<br>01:07:14,139 –&gt; 01:07:18,139<br>And then these are where you use by the mine pulls.</p>
<p>648<br>01:07:18,139 –&gt; 01:07:23,139<br>People’s right, they can have high speed links to many peers.</p>
<p>649<br>01:07:23,139 –&gt; 01:07:26,139<br>So that if they find a block, they can actually get it out first.</p>
<p>650<br>01:07:26,139 –&gt; 01:07:29,139<br>And so they win, etc, etc.</p>
<p>651<br>01:07:29,139 –&gt; 01:07:35,139<br>So this is a, you know, if you’re interested in this, you’re going to need lots and lots of information about an online.</p>
<p>652<br>01:07:35,139 –&gt; 01:07:43,139<br>But you know, still the system seems to be sort of hanging together.</p>
<p>653<br>01:07:43,139 –&gt; 01:07:50,139<br>OK, let me talk a little bit about the whole bunch of sort of practical issues that I sort of ignored, although we touched on it a bit.</p>
<p>654<br>01:07:50,139 –&gt; 01:08:00,139<br>So first 10 minutes.</p>
<p>655<br>01:08:00,139 –&gt; 01:08:15,139<br>I think the 10 minutes is basically use of the time, you know, the sort of an upper bound where like if you really like this sort of 10 times the time roughly to flood the network.</p>
<p>656<br>01:08:15,139 –&gt; 01:08:25,139<br>So Bitcoin wants to try to avoid, you know, these sort of privilege.</p>
<p>657<br>01:08:25,139 –&gt; 01:08:36,139<br>Fibless forks were basically two notes at the same time roughly compute and therefore extend kind of the chain roughly at the same time.</p>
<p>658<br>01:08:36,140 –&gt; 01:08:49,140<br>And want to try to avoid that. And so one way to avoid that is to basically give enough time to the notes to sort of get the block out to many, many, many peers.</p>
<p>659<br>01:08:49,140 –&gt; 01:08:52,140<br>So that most peers actually know about it.</p>
<p>660<br>01:08:52,140 –&gt; 01:08:58,140<br>And that’s why it is sort of the 10 minutes comes from.</p>
<p>661<br>01:08:58,140 –&gt; 01:09:09,140<br>Of course, the block size determines the the number of transactions per second.</p>
<p>662<br>01:09:09,140 –&gt; 01:09:19,140<br>And the blocks actually roughly megabyte. And so, you know, you’re going to do one block, you know, per roughly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>663<br>01:09:19,140 –&gt; 01:09:30,140<br>Then, you know, the number of transactions is limited to the number of the number of the interaction that fit in the same walk.</p>
<p>664<br>01:09:30,140 –&gt; 01:09:34,140<br>And that is the number of transactions you can do.</p>
<p>665<br>01:09:34,140 –&gt; 01:09:44,140<br>And turns out that for today, you know, that the number of transactions is like in the thousands per second, you sort of work out the numbers and that’s sufficient.</p>
<p>666<br>01:09:44,140 –&gt; 01:09:52,140<br>And for example, there’s probably, you know, the knowledge that people always make, you know, sort of bigger than the sort of visa network, you know, the more transaction of visa process.</p>
<p>667<br>01:09:52,140 –&gt; 01:10:03,140<br>By far, it’s only not big enough to actually, you know, basically run all transactions, you know, money transaction the world across.</p>
<p>668<br>01:10:03,140 –&gt; 01:10:08,140<br>Another sort of big, you know, this come back to this in a second.</p>
<p>669<br>01:10:08,140 –&gt; 01:10:14,140<br>Another sort of big issue is that changes, you know, to the protocol.</p>
<p>670<br>01:10:14,140 –&gt; 01:10:23,140<br>Change required consensus.</p>
<p>671<br>01:10:23,140 –&gt; 01:10:27,140<br>In some cases, this is easy, right?</p>
<p>672<br>01:10:27,140 –&gt; 01:10:32,140<br>Some changes are easy.</p>
<p>673<br>01:10:32,140 –&gt; 01:10:36,140<br>Everyone easy changes, for example, the number of leading zeros.</p>
<p>674<br>01:10:36,140 –&gt; 01:10:48,140<br>There’s basically a deterministic algorithm to compute from the past log entries, what the difficulty is going to be for future puzzles.</p>
<p>675<br>01:10:48,140 –&gt; 01:11:00,140<br>And that is a deterministic function of the log, you know, there’s nothing in that changes are basically an easy and there’s a bunch of other parameters in the protocol that have that kind of flavor.</p>
<p>676<br>01:11:00,140 –&gt; 01:11:11,140<br>Some changes, however, result in a software.</p>
<p>677<br>01:11:11,140 –&gt; 01:11:23,140<br>And that’s a little bit about, let’s say you know, you know, the main software, the main distribution to core distribution for Bitcoin wants to make a change that there are these sort of incompatible.</p>
<p>678<br>01:11:23,140 –&gt; 01:11:30,140<br>Then you’re going to have old clients, clients running with the old software or peers running with the old server and new peers with the new software.</p>
<p>679<br>01:11:30,140 –&gt; 01:11:34,140<br>And that will temporarily, you know, may create some forks.</p>
<p>680<br>01:11:34,140 –&gt; 01:11:42,140<br>So, there’s, you know, there’s some communication going on and in the long run, you know, probably people will settle on the new fork.</p>
<p>681<br>01:11:42,140 –&gt; 01:11:45,140<br>We have the new shopper.</p>
<p>682<br>01:11:45,140 –&gt; 01:11:54,140<br>Some changes actually result in a hard fork.</p>
<p>683<br>01:11:54,140 –&gt; 01:12:08,140<br>So, for example, there was a couple years ago, there was a lot of discussion about this block size, because some people in the community want to increase the block size, some other people don’t want to increase the block size.</p>
<p>684<br>01:12:08,140 –&gt; 01:12:23,140<br>And basically, you know, they split and there’s quarters of two Bitcoin or two Bitcoin forks running.</p>
<p>685<br>01:12:23,140 –&gt; 01:12:31,140<br>And so, probably more than two, but like that one was all that in a hard work and hard for it split.</p>
<p>686<br>01:12:31,140 –&gt; 01:12:47,140<br>And so, sort of an interesting, you know, aspect of discoursensis, kind of that kind of systems that, you know, you’re going to have these kinds of practical problems that actually can really either into software or in hard for it, or people just don’t want to collaborate on a particular form.</p>
<p>687<br>01:12:47,140 –&gt; 01:12:51,140<br>Any questions about this.</p>
<p>688<br>01:12:51,140 –&gt; 01:13:01,140<br>What happens in hard forks like you have to do two different block change and clients have to choose in which fork they want to be.</p>
<p>689<br>01:13:01,140 –&gt; 01:13:03,140<br>Interesting.</p>
<p>690<br>01:13:03,140 –&gt; 01:13:07,140<br>Or publish their things actually in both.</p>
<p>691<br>01:13:07,140 –&gt; 01:13:13,140<br>I mean, but you have like, I mean, say I have like a couple of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>692<br>01:13:13,140 –&gt; 01:13:21,140<br>I have a couple like Bitcoin in both forks, right? But I can start spending them in either like.</p>
<p>693<br>01:13:21,140 –&gt; 01:13:25,140<br>Well, you have you have Bitcoin in the prefix of the.</p>
<p>694<br>01:13:25,140 –&gt; 01:13:26,140<br>Yeah, correct.</p>
<p>695<br>01:13:26,140 –&gt; 01:13:28,140<br>So both both forks have the prefix.</p>
<p>696<br>01:13:28,140 –&gt; 01:13:31,140<br>Yeah, you can’t double spend your money.</p>
<p>697<br>01:13:31,140 –&gt; 01:13:32,140<br>Huh.</p>
<p>698<br>01:13:32,140 –&gt; 01:13:41,140<br>Well, so actually in the case of like when Bitcoin for there was a hard fork and they in the one of the new forks was called Bitcoin cash.</p>
<p>699<br>01:13:41,140 –&gt; 01:13:43,140<br>All the tokens were duplicated.</p>
<p>700<br>01:13:43,140 –&gt; 01:13:44,140<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>701<br>01:13:44,140 –&gt; 01:13:48,140<br>But then the value of the tokens.</p>
<p>702<br>01:13:48,140 –&gt; 01:13:56,140<br>It wasn’t like you doubled your values like the price of Bitcoin decrease and then the difference in that decrease was the value of the Bitcoin cash.</p>
<p>703<br>01:13:56,140 –&gt; 01:14:07,140<br>So it’s think of it like a stock split like you get more tokens, but the actual value would stay the same because you’re just increasing the supply of tokens.</p>
<p>704<br>01:14:07,140 –&gt; 01:14:09,140<br>Okay.</p>
<p>705<br>01:14:09,140 –&gt; 01:14:12,140<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>706<br>01:14:12,140 –&gt; 01:14:19,140<br>Any other questions?</p>
<p>707<br>01:14:19,140 –&gt; 01:14:20,140<br>Okay, good.</p>
<p>708<br>01:14:20,140 –&gt; 01:14:28,140<br>Let me summarize them.</p>
<p>709<br>01:14:28,140 –&gt; 01:14:37,140<br>So basically what we’ve seen here is going to distribute consensus.</p>
<p>710<br>01:14:37,140 –&gt; 01:14:45,140<br>But in an open distributed systems, we have potentially potentially a bit of participants.</p>
<p>711<br>01:14:45,140 –&gt; 01:14:47,140<br>Like see my program crash.</p>
<p>712<br>01:14:47,140 –&gt; 01:15:11,140<br>Check.</p>
<p>713<br>01:15:11,140 –&gt; 01:15:34,140<br>And the thing that actually is being reached consensus on this public measure or public law, if you will.</p>
<p>714<br>01:15:34,140 –&gt; 01:15:40,140<br>And then the thing that I’m going to do is to get the order on the transaction ever since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>715<br>01:15:40,140 –&gt; 01:15:51,140<br>And allow people to check what the balances are of every public key and avoid double spending.</p>
<p>716<br>01:15:51,140 –&gt; 01:16:05,140<br>And the particular cause of the idea here is to basically just prove a work idea to determine actually who is allowed to extend the blockchain.</p>
<p>717<br>01:16:05,140 –&gt; 01:16:07,140<br>Okay.</p>
<p>718<br>01:16:07,140 –&gt; 01:16:10,140<br>So basically I have all I want to say.</p>
<p>719<br>01:16:10,140 –&gt; 01:16:16,140<br>And so if you need to run and leave, feel free to leave. This is basically the end of this lecture.</p>
<p>720<br>01:16:16,140 –&gt; 01:16:21,140<br>And anybody who wants to stay and ask more questions, please feel free to stay on first day.</p>
<p>721<br>01:16:21,140 –&gt; 01:16:22,140<br>There’s no lecture.</p>
<p>722<br>01:16:22,140 –&gt; 01:16:23,140<br>It’s a hacking day.</p>
<p>723<br>01:16:23,140 –&gt; 01:16:30,140<br>As you know, the Fridays, the deadline for the final project or lap for whatever you would be doing.</p>
<p>724<br>01:16:30,140 –&gt; 01:16:31,140<br>So good luck.</p>
<p>725<br>01:16:31,140 –&gt; 01:16:34,140<br>You know, trying to get that work finished.</p>
<p>726<br>01:16:34,140 –&gt; 01:16:39,140<br>And we’ll talk in the next class meetings next Tuesday.</p>
<p>727<br>01:16:39,140 –&gt; 01:16:44,140<br>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>728<br>01:16:44,140 –&gt; 01:16:50,140<br>Could you talk a little more about the proof of stake?</p>
<p>729<br>01:16:50,140 –&gt; 01:16:57,140<br>There’s a sure I’m not sure you’re going to have a ton of say about it.</p>
<p>730<br>01:16:57,140 –&gt; 01:17:01,140<br>If you want to know any more details, you know, just Google proof of stake.</p>
<p>731<br>01:17:01,140 –&gt; 01:17:05,140<br>You’ll find a little bit of big coin currencies that use it.</p>
<p>732<br>01:17:05,140 –&gt; 01:17:08,140<br>And I’ll tell you more detail.</p>
<p>733<br>01:17:08,140 –&gt; 01:17:16,140<br>But basically, you know, the power in the network is proportionate to your stake in the network.</p>
<p>734<br>01:17:16,140 –&gt; 01:17:27,140<br>And the basic idea is that like if you own like whatever, 3% or 10% of all the bitcoins, you know, you get sort of to decide 10% of the new blocks.</p>
<p>735<br>01:17:27,140 –&gt; 01:17:36,140<br>And you’re going to have incentive, you know, the higher your stake, you know, the higher incentive the section is to play the game correctly.</p>
<p>736<br>01:17:36,140 –&gt; 01:17:41,140<br>And it becomes more deterministic in that case, right?</p>
<p>737<br>01:17:41,140 –&gt; 01:17:46,140<br>I’ll depends on the details of the protocol.</p>
<p>738<br>01:17:46,140 –&gt; 01:18:00,140<br>I don’t think you know, basically there’s a PR article of the meter, there’s a committee election and then the committee decides on like, you know, what the next, you know, walk is and then, you know, there’s a new meter in the new community election, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>739<br>01:18:00,140 –&gt; 01:18:15,140<br>And many aspects of that are, you know, probabilistic and randomized so that the attacker can like win the game.</p>
<p>740<br>01:18:15,140 –&gt; 01:18:27,140<br>And these protocols are quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>741<br>01:18:27,140 –&gt; 01:18:35,140<br>Also to be able to mine you have to have of the log to verify the transactions, right?</p>
<p>742<br>01:18:35,140 –&gt; 01:18:37,140<br>Yes.</p>
<p>743<br>01:18:37,140 –&gt; 01:18:42,140<br>Yeah, so the mind is a complete copy of the lock which is big advice.</p>
<p>744<br>01:18:42,140 –&gt; 01:18:44,140<br>Isn’t that a lot?</p>
<p>745<br>01:18:44,140 –&gt; 01:18:46,140<br>I can turn down that to you now.</p>
<p>746<br>01:18:46,140 –&gt; 01:18:49,140<br>Totally doable for a reasonable computer.</p>
<p>747<br>01:18:49,140 –&gt; 01:18:51,140<br>Okay.</p>
<p>748<br>01:18:51,140 –&gt; 01:18:52,140<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>749<br>01:18:52,140 –&gt; 01:18:53,140<br>You’re welcome.</p>
<p>750<br>01:18:57,140 –&gt; 01:19:12,140<br>This is unrelated to the lecture, but you think it’d be possible to talk about during the class and time, like the design that the TAs and that you had for labs three and four, like, because those more open ended.</p>
<p>751<br>01:19:12,140 –&gt; 01:19:13,140<br>So.</p>
<p>752<br>01:19:13,140 –&gt; 01:19:14,140<br>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>753<br>01:19:14,140 –&gt; 01:19:15,140<br>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>754<br>01:19:16,140 –&gt; 01:19:22,140<br>I was not planning to, I don’t know, we have time left to do so.</p>
<p>755<br>01:19:22,140 –&gt; 01:19:25,140<br>First of all, not everybody has done lap four.</p>
<p>756<br>01:19:25,140 –&gt; 01:19:33,140<br>And so I currently have no intention to do so, but of course you can reach out to an office hours and talk to the TAs and.</p>
<p>757<br>01:19:33,140 –&gt; 01:19:39,140<br>Or you reach out later to me and we can talk about a lot of 3 and a lot for.</p>
<p>758<br>01:19:39,140 –&gt; 01:19:41,140<br>Sounds good. Thank you.</p>
<p>759<br>01:19:41,140 –&gt; 01:19:51,140<br>So I had a question about.</p>
<p>760<br>01:19:51,140 –&gt; 01:19:55,140<br>It says it says on the paper like.</p>
<p>761<br>01:19:55,140 –&gt; 01:19:59,140<br>Or rather, sorry.</p>
<p>762<br>01:19:59,140 –&gt; 01:20:04,140<br>Yeah, once it wants the latest transaction, the coin is buried under enough block.</p>
<p>763<br>01:20:04,140 –&gt; 01:20:10,140<br>And then the other spend transaction before it can be discarded to save this space.</p>
<p>764<br>01:20:10,140 –&gt; 01:20:11,140<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>765<br>01:20:11,140 –&gt; 01:20:18,140<br>Like I understood though that, you know, blockchain.</p>
<p>766<br>01:20:18,140 –&gt; 01:20:20,140<br>Never really like like.</p>
<p>767<br>01:20:20,140 –&gt; 01:20:22,140<br>Discards transactions.</p>
<p>768<br>01:20:22,140 –&gt; 01:20:24,140<br>It keeps like a whole log of all the transactions.</p>
<p>769<br>01:20:24,140 –&gt; 01:20:25,140<br>So.</p>
<p>770<br>01:20:25,140 –&gt; 01:20:29,140<br>Why is this like why was this done in practice?</p>
<p>771<br>01:20:29,140 –&gt; 01:20:33,140<br>To save space on the.</p>
<p>772<br>01:20:33,140 –&gt; 01:20:41,140<br>To save stays on the while space compaction on the, you know, on the nodes and the might.</p>
<p>773<br>01:20:41,140 –&gt; 01:20:47,140<br>So they know you have to keep track of every every transaction in the log and over every basically Bitcoin.</p>
<p>774<br>01:20:47,140 –&gt; 01:20:50,140<br>They have to keep track of the last one.</p>
<p>775<br>01:20:50,140 –&gt; 01:20:52,140<br>And efficient.</p>
<p>776<br>01:20:52,140 –&gt; 01:20:56,140<br>So one way to think about it is sort of like, you know, you could compute the snapshot in time.</p>
<p>777<br>01:20:56,140 –&gt; 01:21:00,140<br>Of all the values of all the points.</p>
<p>778<br>01:21:00,140 –&gt; 01:21:04,140<br>And then you don’t really have to remember the whole past.</p>
<p>779<br>01:21:04,140 –&gt; 01:21:07,140<br>Who does keep the whole past then?</p>
<p>780<br>01:21:07,140 –&gt; 01:21:09,140<br>Oh, yeah, they’re still things.</p>
<p>781<br>01:21:09,140 –&gt; 01:21:15,140<br>So the one is like, you know, when you check whether transaction is valid, you know, go use can the whole log.</p>
<p>782<br>01:21:15,140 –&gt; 01:21:16,140<br>People don’t do that.</p>
<p>783<br>01:21:16,140 –&gt; 01:21:19,140<br>And the fact is that they’re not going to be able to do that.</p>
<p>784<br>01:21:19,140 –&gt; 01:21:25,140<br>So the data structure is not quite compact and has the last transaction for every.</p>
<p>785<br>01:21:25,140 –&gt; 01:21:26,140<br>Unspent.</p>
<p>786<br>01:21:26,140 –&gt; 01:21:28,140<br>You know, coin.</p>
<p>787<br>01:21:28,140 –&gt; 01:21:32,140<br>The, you know, you can totally download the whole log.</p>
<p>788<br>01:21:32,140 –&gt; 01:21:34,140<br>You know, from the, you want to from the internet.</p>
<p>789<br>01:21:34,140 –&gt; 01:21:35,140<br>It is maintained.</p>
<p>790<br>01:21:35,140 –&gt; 01:21:38,140<br>And note store it.</p>
<p>791<br>01:21:38,140 –&gt; 01:21:42,140<br>You know, to basically the lose all the data that can.</p>
<p>792<br>01:21:42,140 –&gt; 01:21:46,140<br>And theнее balance is going to basically.</p>
<p>793<br>01:21:46,140 –&gt; 01:21:48,140<br>From running all the injection from beginning of time.</p>
<p>794<br>01:21:48,140 –&gt; 01:21:50,140<br>Um, but.</p>
<p>795<br>01:21:50,140 –&gt; 01:21:57,140<br>So, so like if people are, like, who maintains a whole block and the whole transactions, like.</p>
<p>796<br>01:21:57,140 –&gt; 01:22:01,140<br>I’m happy to get it everywhere Anyway, like, everybody and I will want to when I can hook a copy of the law.</p>
<p>797<br>01:22:01,140 –&gt; 01:22:02,140<br>Right.</p>
<p>798<br>01:22:02,140 –&gt; 01:22:07,140<br>But most people are doing this and it’s carting transactions.</p>
<p>799<br>01:22:07,140 –&gt; 01:22:10,140<br>Like why would someone keep the whole like?</p>
<p>800<br>01:22:10,140 –&gt; 01:22:21,140<br>This is not good enough to actually keep track of this allows you to decide where intersection was actually happening to pass, but it doesn’t allow you to validate transactions.</p>
<p>801<br>01:22:21,140 –&gt; 01:22:23,140<br>So you want to validate transaction you have to keep the past.</p>
<p>802<br>01:22:23,140 –&gt; 01:22:25,140<br>Okay.</p>
<p>803<br>01:22:25,140 –&gt; 01:22:27,140<br>Okay.</p>
<p>804<br>01:22:27,140 –&gt; 01:22:28,140<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>805<br>01:22:28,140 –&gt; 01:22:33,140<br>Welcome.</p>
<p>806<br>01:22:33,140 –&gt; 01:22:37,140<br>Any more questions?</p>
<p>807<br>01:22:37,140 –&gt; 01:22:40,140<br>Okay. Thanks.</p>
