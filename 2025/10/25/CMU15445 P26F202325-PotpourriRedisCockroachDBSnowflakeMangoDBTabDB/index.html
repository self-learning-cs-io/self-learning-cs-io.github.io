<p>5<br>00:00:24,900 –&gt; 00:00:27,260<br>ride out to take your parts</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:27,260 –&gt; 00:00:27,960<br>please</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:27,960 –&gt; 00:00:30,960<br>How you doing?</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:30,960 –&gt; 00:00:31,960<br>I’m doing well.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:31,960 –&gt; 00:00:33,960<br>I think a lot of things here today.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:33,960 –&gt; 00:00:39,960<br>And by the way, so DTHPL’s agent sent over his glossies.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:39,960 –&gt; 00:00:42,960<br>So he’s signing autographs if you want with him afterwards.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:42,960 –&gt; 00:00:44,960<br>So we have enough for everyone.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:44,960 –&gt; 00:00:45,960<br>So it’s a nice photo.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:45,960 –&gt; 00:00:46,960<br>Yeah, it’s pretty nice.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:46,960 –&gt; 00:00:47,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:47,960 –&gt; 00:00:49,960<br>Yeah, your agent is very aggressive.</p>
<p>17<br>00:00:49,960 –&gt; 00:00:50,960<br>He’s got to sign autographs.</p>
<p>18<br>00:00:50,960 –&gt; 00:00:51,960<br>It’s a class.</p>
<p>19<br>00:00:51,960 –&gt; 00:00:52,960<br>It’s kind of weird.</p>
<p>20<br>00:00:52,960 –&gt; 00:00:53,960<br>But whatever.</p>
<p>21<br>00:00:53,960 –&gt; 00:00:54,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>22<br>00:00:54,960 –&gt; 00:00:55,960<br>All right, guys.</p>
<p>23<br>00:00:55,960 –&gt; 00:00:56,960<br>A lot to cover.</p>
<p>24<br>00:00:56,960 –&gt; 00:00:58,960<br>So let’s finish up.</p>
<p>25<br>00:00:58,960 –&gt; 00:01:02,960<br>So for the major thing on the doc, if you guys other than the final exam,</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:02,960 –&gt; 00:01:04,960<br>again, is Project 4.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:04,960 –&gt; 00:01:06,960<br>It’s going to be due this Monday at midnight.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:06,960 –&gt; 00:01:10,960<br>And then we’re having the extra office hours on Saturday,</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:10,960 –&gt; 00:01:12,960<br>on the fourth floor in gates.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:12,960 –&gt; 00:01:13,960<br>OK?</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:13,960 –&gt; 00:01:16,960<br>Who here has not started Project 4?</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:16,960 –&gt; 00:01:17,960<br>Really?</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:17,960 –&gt; 00:01:18,960<br>Bold.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:18,960 –&gt; 00:01:20,960<br>OK.</p>
<p>35<br>00:01:20,960 –&gt; 00:01:22,960<br>That’s not a good idea.</p>
<p>36<br>00:01:22,960 –&gt; 00:01:23,960<br>OK.</p>
<p>37<br>00:01:23,959 –&gt; 00:01:24,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>38<br>00:01:24,959 –&gt; 00:01:26,959<br>Any high level questions about Project 4?</p>
<p>39<br>00:01:26,959 –&gt; 00:01:27,959<br>Yes.</p>
<p>40<br>00:01:27,959 –&gt; 00:01:29,959<br>You can use the idea of Project 4.</p>
<p>41<br>00:01:29,959 –&gt; 00:01:30,959<br>Yes.</p>
<p>42<br>00:01:30,959 –&gt; 00:01:35,959<br>I mean, we set the due date because the university policies that we’re not supposed</p>
<p>43<br>00:01:35,959 –&gt; 00:01:37,959<br>to have anything due during the finals week.</p>
<p>44<br>00:01:37,959 –&gt; 00:01:39,959<br>I did it one year ago in trouble.</p>
<p>45<br>00:01:39,959 –&gt; 00:01:40,959<br>So yeah.</p>
<p>46<br>00:01:40,959 –&gt; 00:01:43,959<br>Any other questions?</p>
<p>47<br>00:01:43,959 –&gt; 00:01:44,959<br>Yes.</p>
<p>48<br>00:01:44,959 –&gt; 00:01:50,959<br>Is this a project called on the plan and used in subsequent phases?</p>
<p>49<br>00:01:50,959 –&gt; 00:01:54,959<br>Because it’s, I feel like, the most type of student project on all of it.</p>
<p>50<br>00:01:54,959 –&gt; 00:01:57,959<br>His state of it is, is Project 4 going to be used in previous semesters?</p>
<p>51<br>00:01:57,959 –&gt; 00:02:00,959<br>Because it’s the most time consuming of all the projects you’ve done so far.</p>
<p>52<br>00:02:00,959 –&gt; 00:02:01,959<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>53<br>00:02:01,959 –&gt; 00:02:03,959<br>We were, the plan is yes.</p>
<p>54<br>00:02:03,959 –&gt; 00:02:07,959<br>We probably will use it in subsequent semesters.</p>
<p>55<br>00:02:07,959 –&gt; 00:02:10,959<br>We try to dial down down the complexity quite a bit.</p>
<p>56<br>00:02:10,959 –&gt; 00:02:13,959<br>This is sort of why we give you the test ahead of time, why we said,</p>
<p>57<br>00:02:13,959 –&gt; 00:02:17,959<br>OK, here’s all this extra bonus stuff you could do if you wanted to.</p>
<p>58<br>00:02:18,960 –&gt; 00:02:21,960<br>But we’ll see how it goes and we will adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>59<br>00:02:21,960 –&gt; 00:02:22,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>60<br>00:02:22,960 –&gt; 00:02:25,960<br>I just remind you to talk about some things that we can find out.</p>
<p>61<br>00:02:25,960 –&gt; 00:02:26,960<br>That’ll be later at the end.</p>
<p>62<br>00:02:26,960 –&gt; 00:02:27,960<br>I didn’t forget.</p>
<p>63<br>00:02:27,960 –&gt; 00:02:29,960<br>There’s slides on that.</p>
<p>64<br>00:02:29,960 –&gt; 00:02:30,960<br>There’s some things you brought up here.</p>
<p>65<br>00:02:30,960 –&gt; 00:02:32,960<br>I’ll tell you what we discussed in that.</p>
<p>66<br>00:02:32,960 –&gt; 00:02:33,960<br>What we’ll discuss at the end.</p>
<p>67<br>00:02:33,960 –&gt; 00:02:34,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>68<br>00:02:34,960 –&gt; 00:02:36,960<br>The question about Project 4.</p>
<p>69<br>00:02:36,960 –&gt; 00:02:37,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>70<br>00:02:37,960 –&gt; 00:02:38,960<br>Cool.</p>
<p>71<br>00:02:38,960 –&gt; 00:02:41,960<br>So again, reminder, and we’ll post us a few apps again.</p>
<p>72<br>00:02:41,960 –&gt; 00:02:44,960<br>If you like databases a lot, you like this class.</p>
<p>73<br>00:02:44,960 –&gt; 00:02:48,960<br>Or you think bus stop is terrible and you want to rewrite a lot of it.</p>
<p>74<br>00:02:48,960 –&gt; 00:02:51,960<br>Gignette is teaching this next semester in the spring.</p>
<p>75<br>00:02:51,960 –&gt; 00:02:55,960<br>So if you’re going to be around in one of the TA, by all means, please sign up.</p>
<p>76<br>00:02:55,960 –&gt; 00:02:58,960<br>And again, you don’t have to be like, gee,</p>
<p>77<br>00:02:58,960 –&gt; 00:03:01,960<br>gee is violating labor laws sometimes.</p>
<p>78<br>00:03:01,960 –&gt; 00:03:04,960<br>And we don’t want to do that.</p>
<p>79<br>00:03:04,960 –&gt; 00:03:07,960<br>So don’t, I’ve had two people come to me like, yeah, I want to be a TA.</p>
<p>80<br>00:03:07,960 –&gt; 00:03:09,960<br>But do I have to be like, gee, and there’s no.</p>
<p>81<br>00:03:09,960 –&gt; 00:03:10,960<br>OK.</p>
<p>82<br>00:03:10,960 –&gt; 00:03:11,960<br>The kids are freak.</p>
<p>83<br>00:03:11,960 –&gt; 00:03:12,960<br>He might be on cocaine.</p>
<p>84<br>00:03:12,960 –&gt; 00:03:15,960<br>But he’s graduating.</p>
<p>85<br>00:03:15,960 –&gt; 00:03:16,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>86<br>00:03:16,960 –&gt; 00:03:18,960<br>Any questions about this?</p>
<p>87<br>00:03:18,960 –&gt; 00:03:19,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>88<br>00:03:19,960 –&gt; 00:03:21,960<br>So the other thing, too, also, will pistols and piata.</p>
<p>89<br>00:03:21,960 –&gt; 00:03:22,960<br>Your feedback is strongly needed.</p>
<p>90<br>00:03:22,960 –&gt; 00:03:26,960<br>So the point he has brought up, hey, Project 4 is way too hard relative to the other projects.</p>
<p>91<br>00:03:26,960 –&gt; 00:03:28,960<br>It used to be Project 2 was too hard.</p>
<p>92<br>00:03:28,960 –&gt; 00:03:30,960<br>And then we try to be balancing.</p>
<p>93<br>00:03:30,960 –&gt; 00:03:32,960<br>So we do listen to feedback.</p>
<p>94<br>00:03:32,960 –&gt; 00:03:34,960<br>And we went to your opinion about everything.</p>
<p>95<br>00:03:34,960 –&gt; 00:03:37,960<br>Now, for undergrads, I don’t need to explain to you what’s like the right course feedback.</p>
<p>96<br>00:03:37,960 –&gt; 00:03:39,960<br>It’s for the master students.</p>
<p>97<br>00:03:39,960 –&gt; 00:03:40,960<br>You guys are terrible.</p>
<p>98<br>00:03:40,960 –&gt; 00:03:44,960<br>I’m not saying you, anybody in particular, but every year the master students like, this class is great.</p>
<p>99<br>00:03:44,960 –&gt; 00:03:45,960<br>This class is great.</p>
<p>100<br>00:03:45,960 –&gt; 00:03:46,960<br>This class is great.</p>
<p>101<br>00:03:46,960 –&gt; 00:03:50,960<br>Whereas the undergrads go in very details and a lot of these are about what things are wrong and what we can do better.</p>
<p>102<br>00:03:50,960 –&gt; 00:03:52,960<br>So if you’re a master student, please be brutal.</p>
<p>103<br>00:03:52,960 –&gt; 00:03:53,960<br>It’s a non-nose.</p>
<p>104<br>00:03:53,960 –&gt; 00:03:54,960<br>I can’t see it.</p>
<p>105<br>00:03:54,960 –&gt; 00:03:55,960<br>We don’t see names.</p>
<p>106<br>00:03:55,960 –&gt; 00:03:58,960<br>So by all means, if things are, you want to do things better, let us know.</p>
<p>107<br>00:03:58,960 –&gt; 00:03:59,960<br>OK.</p>
<p>108<br>00:03:59,960 –&gt; 00:04:07,960<br>And again, if you’re not graduating, come make suggestions in the course feedback and then come in the spring of BTA and fix things for future people.</p>
<p>109<br>00:04:08,960 –&gt; 00:04:14,960<br>For office hours leading up to the final exam, I’m moving mine to be on Monday at 9.30 in the morning over Zoom.</p>
<p>110<br>00:04:14,960 –&gt; 00:04:17,960<br>Tignesh is actually with his wife right now.</p>
<p>111<br>00:04:17,960 –&gt; 00:04:19,960<br>So he’s not going to be on campus for less of a semester.</p>
<p>112<br>00:04:19,960 –&gt; 00:04:22,960<br>So his office hours also be a noon or so over Zoom.</p>
<p>113<br>00:04:22,960 –&gt; 00:04:27,960<br>If you want to meet with me, beyond these hours, please send an email and I will try to accommodate you.</p>
<p>114<br>00:04:27,960 –&gt; 00:04:28,960<br>OK.</p>
<p>115<br>00:04:28,960 –&gt; 00:04:31,960<br>And then the TAs will hold the regular office hours up to and including this Friday.</p>
<p>116<br>00:04:32,959 –&gt; 00:04:40,959<br>They will have the project for office hours on Saturday and then there won’t be any office hours from the TAs starting next week.</p>
<p>117<br>00:04:40,959 –&gt; 00:04:41,959<br>OK.</p>
<p>118<br>00:04:41,959 –&gt; 00:04:43,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>119<br>00:04:43,959 –&gt; 00:04:44,959<br>So the final exam.</p>
<p>120<br>00:04:44,959 –&gt; 00:04:46,959<br>Who has to take it?</p>
<p>121<br>00:04:46,959 –&gt; 00:04:48,959<br>Anyone in the role in the class?</p>
<p>122<br>00:04:48,959 –&gt; 00:04:51,959<br>It’s going to be in positive 153.</p>
<p>123<br>00:04:51,959 –&gt; 00:04:52,959<br>I’ll explain how this is going to work yet.</p>
<p>124<br>00:04:52,959 –&gt; 00:04:53,959<br>We actually have three locations.</p>
<p>125<br>00:04:53,959 –&gt; 00:04:55,959<br>We’ll see how it’s going to be that up.</p>
<p>126<br>00:04:55,959 –&gt; 00:04:58,959<br>That’ll be next Tuesday, 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>127<br>00:04:58,959 –&gt; 00:05:01,959<br>And go watch that video to understand why.</p>
<p>128<br>00:05:01,959 –&gt; 00:05:03,959<br>If you need a special combination, some of you have already done this.</p>
<p>129<br>00:05:03,959 –&gt; 00:05:09,959<br>If you haven’t yet, please do this as soon as possible so that way we have time to prepare and work with the disability office.</p>
<p>130<br>00:05:09,959 –&gt; 00:05:17,959<br>And then the, I’ll put this on the computer after the class, but the final guide for the exam.</p>
<p>131<br>00:05:17,959 –&gt; 00:05:21,959<br>And the practice exam is available on the website now.</p>
<p>132<br>00:05:21,959 –&gt; 00:05:22,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>133<br>00:05:22,959 –&gt; 00:05:29,959<br>So if you ever looked at the, the, the, the CMU schedule for the final exams, we’re actually assigned three classrooms.</p>
<p>134<br>00:05:29,959 –&gt; 00:05:33,959<br>We’re in Posner and then the Hall of Arts and then two different rooms.</p>
<p>135<br>00:05:33,959 –&gt; 00:05:39,959<br>So when everyone to show up at Posner 153, which is the big building, they’re starting the big room, show up there.</p>
<p>136<br>00:05:39,959 –&gt; 00:05:42,959<br>We will then assign you to a random location so that we can spread out.</p>
<p>137<br>00:05:42,959 –&gt; 00:05:43,959<br>Posner is the bigger one.</p>
<p>138<br>00:05:43,959 –&gt; 00:05:47,959<br>Most of you guys would be in there, but we’ll just randomly spread out across the different rooms that are close to each other.</p>
<p>139<br>00:05:47,959 –&gt; 00:05:53,959<br>And there’ll be two TAs in every single room and then myself, I’ll be bouncing around asking questions and helping as, as we go along.</p>
<p>140<br>00:05:53,959 –&gt; 00:05:54,959<br>Okay.</p>
<p>141<br>00:05:54,959 –&gt; 00:06:00,959<br>So again, everyone show up to Posner, one key to three and then we’ll figure out where do you go after that?</p>
<p>142<br>00:06:00,959 –&gt; 00:06:03,959<br>The rooms are as far as I know, they’re, they’re close to each other.</p>
<p>143<br>00:06:03,959 –&gt; 00:06:04,959<br>Okay.</p>
<p>144<br>00:06:04,959 –&gt; 00:06:05,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>145<br>00:06:05,959 –&gt; 00:06:06,959<br>So what to bring.</p>
<p>146<br>00:06:06,959 –&gt; 00:06:09,959<br>Obviously, we need your CMU ID, bring a pencil and an eraser.</p>
<p>147<br>00:06:09,959 –&gt; 00:06:15,959<br>You can take the exam and a pen if you want to, but then you’re going to scratch things out and it’s going to be huge pain for us to deal with.</p>
<p>148<br>00:06:16,959 –&gt; 00:06:19,959<br>So please, be a pencil, please, be an eraser.</p>
<p>149<br>00:06:19,959 –&gt; 00:06:21,959<br>You may need a calculator.</p>
<p>150<br>00:06:21,959 –&gt; 00:06:24,959<br>Using your cell phone is sufficient because most of you don’t have single calculators.</p>
<p>151<br>00:06:24,959 –&gt; 00:06:31,959<br>And then you can bring one sheet of notes double-sided and they had to be handwritten, just like you had in the midterm exam.</p>
<p>152<br>00:06:31,959 –&gt; 00:06:35,959<br>One year, K was hacking HFT theme clothing.</p>
<p>153<br>00:06:35,959 –&gt; 00:06:39,959<br>This is two years ago when that was a thing.</p>
<p>154<br>00:06:39,959 –&gt; 00:06:41,959<br>Actually, I take that.</p>
<p>155<br>00:06:41,959 –&gt; 00:06:42,959<br>I don’t care if you want to.</p>
<p>156<br>00:06:42,959 –&gt; 00:06:43,959<br>I waste your money on NFT clothing.</p>
<p>157<br>00:06:43,959 –&gt; 00:06:44,959<br>That’s, that’s your problem.</p>
<p>158<br>00:06:44,959 –&gt; 00:06:45,959<br>Okay.</p>
<p>159<br>00:06:45,959 –&gt; 00:06:46,959<br>But you can bring food.</p>
<p>160<br>00:06:46,959 –&gt; 00:06:49,959<br>We’ll have fee and donuts for everyone as well early in the morning.</p>
<p>161<br>00:06:49,959 –&gt; 00:06:51,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>162<br>00:06:51,959 –&gt; 00:06:55,959<br>All right. So what will be on the exam in terms of everything that was before the midterm.</p>
<p>163<br>00:06:55,959 –&gt; 00:06:57,959<br>Obviously, you need to know SQL.</p>
<p>164<br>00:06:57,959 –&gt; 00:07:03,959<br>If you’ve forgotten SQL at this point after homework one and other things, then you have other problems.</p>
<p>165<br>00:07:03,959 –&gt; 00:07:05,959<br>But everyone should have basic understanding of SQL.</p>
<p>166<br>00:07:05,959 –&gt; 00:07:07,959<br>So if we show you SQL query, you understand what it’s doing.</p>
<p>167<br>00:07:07,959 –&gt; 00:07:12,959<br>You obviously need to know what the Buffalo manager is doing because in the context of logging recovery,</p>
<p>168<br>00:07:12,959 –&gt; 00:07:16,959<br>how do you know when things are allowed to be written out the disk.</p>
<p>169<br>00:07:16,959 –&gt; 00:07:20,959<br>You need to understand basic data structures, hash trees, people’s trees, when to use one versus the other.</p>
<p>170<br>00:07:20,959 –&gt; 00:07:22,959<br>The storage model is column storage.</p>
<p>171<br>00:07:22,959 –&gt; 00:07:23,959<br>This is row stores.</p>
<p>172<br>00:07:23,959 –&gt; 00:07:26,959<br>And how much data is going to get moved around potentially if it’s in an instrument environment.</p>
<p>173<br>00:07:26,959 –&gt; 00:07:28,959<br>Query processing models.</p>
<p>174<br>00:07:28,959 –&gt; 00:07:32,959<br>What are the actual operators themselves when they’re pushing or pulling data up?</p>
<p>175<br>00:07:32,959 –&gt; 00:07:36,959<br>Are they sending batches, vectors, or entire results set?</p>
<p>176<br>00:07:36,959 –&gt; 00:07:39,959<br>And then basic interquery parallelism.</p>
<p>177<br>00:07:39,959 –&gt; 00:07:42,959<br>Like there’s an exchange operator you would use to combine things.</p>
<p>178<br>00:07:42,959 –&gt; 00:07:43,959<br>Sorry, that’s interquery.</p>
<p>179<br>00:07:43,959 –&gt; 00:07:46,959<br>Interquery parallelism, the multiple queries, running at the same time.</p>
<p>180<br>00:07:46,959 –&gt; 00:07:48,959<br>What are the implications of that?</p>
<p>181<br>00:07:48,959 –&gt; 00:07:53,959<br>All right. So the basic high level information need to know from before the midterm.</p>
<p>182<br>00:07:53,959 –&gt; 00:07:56,959<br>For the things that we did cover the midterm going forward,</p>
<p>183<br>00:07:56,959 –&gt; 00:07:59,959<br>you know, understand basics about query optimization.</p>
<p>184<br>00:07:59,959 –&gt; 00:08:02,959<br>We obviously only had one lecture on this and it’s a very complicated topic.</p>
<p>185<br>00:08:02,959 –&gt; 00:08:10,959<br>So we can’t go into too much detail, but it’s basic information about what are the implications of doing predicate pushdown into query plan or projection pushdown.</p>
<p>186<br>00:08:10,959 –&gt; 00:08:16,959<br>Or how can you rewrite a sub query to pull things out and execute it as a join?</p>
<p>187<br>00:08:16,959 –&gt; 00:08:20,959<br>We’re obviously not going to ask you to derive an algorithm that does that because it’s hard,</p>
<p>188<br>00:08:20,959 –&gt; 00:08:23,959<br>but at high level, what does that actually look like?</p>
<p>189<br>00:08:23,959 –&gt; 00:08:28,959<br>We talked about basic information about collecting statistics, cardinality, estimations, histograms.</p>
<p>190<br>00:08:28,959 –&gt; 00:08:33,960<br>Again, we can’t obviously go into too much detail, but you can understand this at a high level.</p>
<p>191<br>00:08:33,960 –&gt; 00:08:36,960<br>And then what are the implications of something using a cost-based search?</p>
<p>192<br>00:08:36,960 –&gt; 00:08:42,960<br>Like how would that plug in with one of these cost models to determine the correct join order, for example?</p>
<p>193<br>00:08:42,960 –&gt; 00:08:47,960<br>And then you can see how you can fuse this synthesize this knowledge with the distributed basis later on.</p>
<p>194<br>00:08:47,960 –&gt; 00:08:50,960<br>And understand that the cost model will have to include moving data across the network.</p>
<p>195<br>00:08:50,960 –&gt; 00:08:55,960<br>So again, high level things like this, not specific formulas.</p>
<p>196<br>00:08:55,960 –&gt; 00:08:58,960<br>We spent a lot of time talking about transactions.</p>
<p>197<br>00:08:58,960 –&gt; 00:09:04,960<br>So the first sort of set of lectures, or the first lecture was on what we’ll call the theory of transactions, concurrently control.</p>
<p>198<br>00:09:04,960 –&gt; 00:09:08,960<br>Like what does it mean for a database system to say it provides asset guarantees,</p>
<p>199<br>00:09:08,960 –&gt; 00:09:12,960<br>animosity, consistency, isolation, and durability?</p>
<p>200<br>00:09:12,960 –&gt; 00:09:15,960<br>And again, when it was a single node, consistency didn’t quite make sense.</p>
<p>201<br>00:09:15,960 –&gt; 00:09:22,960<br>It made some more sense in the distributed environment, but certainly animosity, isolation, and durability mattered a lot on a single node.</p>
<p>202<br>00:09:22,960 –&gt; 00:09:26,960<br>Then we spent time talking about conflict sterilized ability and view sterilized ability.</p>
<p>203<br>00:09:26,960 –&gt; 00:09:32,960<br>Again, high level concepts and ideas, not necessarily the protocols we’d use to support them.</p>
<p>204<br>00:09:32,960 –&gt; 00:09:33,960<br>That comes later.</p>
<p>205<br>00:09:33,960 –&gt; 00:09:37,960<br>So how would you determine whether a schedule is correct?</p>
<p>206<br>00:09:37,960 –&gt; 00:09:38,960<br>Is conflict sterilizable?</p>
<p>207<br>00:09:38,960 –&gt; 00:09:43,960<br>And how can you determine whether two different schedules are conflict equivalent?</p>
<p>208<br>00:09:43,960 –&gt; 00:09:44,960<br>And then view sterilized ability.</p>
<p>209<br>00:09:44,960 –&gt; 00:09:51,960<br>The main thing is understanding what is the difference of view sterilized ability in terms of what the application sees.</p>
<p>210<br>00:09:51,960 –&gt; 00:09:58,960<br>In terms of correctness and the ordering of operations in a schedule relative to conflict sterilized ability.</p>
<p>211<br>00:09:58,960 –&gt; 00:09:59,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>212<br>00:09:59,960 –&gt; 00:10:09,960<br>In the case of like view sterilized ability, it was about you could reorder things and you still end up the client still end up seeing the same result.</p>
<p>213<br>00:10:09,960 –&gt; 00:10:15,960<br>And again, if a node system implements view sterilized ability, you could need to understand what does correct mean to the application.</p>
<p>214<br>00:10:15,960 –&gt; 00:10:19,960<br>And that’s not something any did to some can reason about now.</p>
<p>215<br>00:10:19,960 –&gt; 00:10:25,960<br>We talked about recoverable schedules and then we talked about isolation levels and anomalies.</p>
<p>216<br>00:10:25,960 –&gt; 00:10:30,960<br>Right. What’s the lowest isolation level in the NC standard?</p>
<p>217<br>00:10:30,960 –&gt; 00:10:32,960<br>Read uncommitted.</p>
<p>218<br>00:10:32,960 –&gt; 00:10:34,960<br>What’s the highest?</p>
<p>219<br>00:10:34,960 –&gt; 00:10:35,960<br>Serialized.</p>
<p>220<br>00:10:35,960 –&gt; 00:10:37,960<br>Yes. Is there anything about the sterilizable?</p>
<p>221<br>00:10:37,960 –&gt; 00:10:38,960<br>Strict sterilized.</p>
<p>222<br>00:10:38,960 –&gt; 00:10:39,960<br>Strict sterilized. Yes. Good.</p>
<p>223<br>00:10:39,960 –&gt; 00:10:40,960<br>Excellent.</p>
<p>224<br>00:10:40,960 –&gt; 00:10:42,960<br>Right. Again, like there’s no form of these.</p>
<p>225<br>00:10:42,960 –&gt; 00:10:45,960<br>There’s to understand what what the anomalies you could have.</p>
<p>226<br>00:10:45,960 –&gt; 00:10:49,960<br>Right. The phantoms, the dirty reads, the unrepeatable reads.</p>
<p>227<br>00:10:49,960 –&gt; 00:10:54,960<br>Right. Understanding all those those things in the context of concurrency tool.</p>
<p>228<br>00:10:54,960 –&gt; 00:10:57,960<br>At the end for specific protocols, we spent a lot of time talking about two days locking.</p>
<p>229<br>00:10:57,960 –&gt; 00:11:01,960<br>Right. The difference between rigorous and non rigorous or strict versus non strict.</p>
<p>230<br>00:11:01,960 –&gt; 00:11:03,960<br>We talked about the cascading of boards problem.</p>
<p>231<br>00:11:03,960 –&gt; 00:11:08,960<br>Right. It’s somebody read for transaction reads data that was uncommitted from another transaction and that other transaction.</p>
<p>232<br>00:11:09,960 –&gt; 00:11:12,960<br>Aborts. You got to roll everyone back in the cascades.</p>
<p>233<br>00:11:12,960 –&gt; 00:11:17,960<br>We talked about the different methods to handle deadlocks, which is the big problem you have in two days locking.</p>
<p>234<br>00:11:17,960 –&gt; 00:11:19,960<br>Right. How do you detect it?</p>
<p>235<br>00:11:19,960 –&gt; 00:11:21,960<br>Where the weights photograph and determine who to kill.</p>
<p>236<br>00:11:21,960 –&gt; 00:11:24,960<br>And then deadlock prevention was wounder weight, weight, and die.</p>
<p>237<br>00:11:24,960 –&gt; 00:11:32,960<br>Trying to figure out some kind of ordering mechanism based on transaction IDs or timestamps of transactions to determine who to kill to avoid a deadlock.</p>
<p>238<br>00:11:32,960 –&gt; 00:11:35,960<br>Or curious of earlier kill somebody else.</p>
<p>239<br>00:11:36,960 –&gt; 00:11:39,960<br>And then we talked about hierarchal locking or multiple granularity locking.</p>
<p>240<br>00:11:39,960 –&gt; 00:11:41,960<br>And this is where we introduced intention locks.</p>
<p>241<br>00:11:41,960 –&gt; 00:11:46,960<br>So as you’re traversing down this hierarchy of the database system, there’s a database.</p>
<p>242<br>00:11:46,960 –&gt; 00:11:48,960<br>You can have a table, table of pages, so forth.</p>
<p>243<br>00:11:48,960 –&gt; 00:11:56,960<br>Or you can take intention locks in those higher levels to to give hints to other transactions that come along about what you may be doing in those lower lower levels.</p>
<p>244<br>00:11:56,960 –&gt; 00:12:03,960<br>And the key thing here is understanding the performance trade offs of allowing for more parallelism by taking as.</p>
<p>245<br>00:12:04,960 –&gt; 00:12:12,960<br>The minimum permission locks as you need at the lowest point in this tree versus having to go to the lock manager over and over again to say I have this lock.</p>
<p>246<br>00:12:12,960 –&gt; 00:12:17,960<br>There’s whole, you know, that’s a has to be concurrent data structure in itself.</p>
<p>247<br>00:12:17,960 –&gt; 00:12:24,960<br>And then lock escalation would be if I hold a lock in this mode, can I take a lock in another mode? When is that allowed?</p>
<p>248<br>00:12:24,960 –&gt; 00:12:26,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>249<br>00:12:27,960 –&gt; 00:12:32,960<br>So you need to memorize the intention lock grid.</p>
<p>250<br>00:12:32,960 –&gt; 00:12:34,960<br>I mean, that helps you understand it.</p>
<p>251<br>00:12:34,960 –&gt; 00:12:39,960<br>But like the, if you understand what like we’re sharing attention shared attention to so you know anything what they are.</p>
<p>252<br>00:12:39,960 –&gt; 00:12:40,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>253<br>00:12:40,960 –&gt; 00:12:41,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>254<br>00:12:41,960 –&gt; 00:12:43,960<br>You go over the performance trade offs.</p>
<p>255<br>00:12:43,960 –&gt; 00:12:50,960<br>So the, the, there’s a trade-off between how much parallels am I have?</p>
<p>256<br>00:12:51,960 –&gt; 00:13:02,960<br>I want to have allowing other transactions to run at the same time and take, take compatible locks on different parts of the database system versus having to go to the lock manager and make a request I want to acquire these locks.</p>
<p>257<br>00:13:02,960 –&gt; 00:13:12,960<br>Right. So an example would be if I have a table and a table has a billion tuples and I want to update all one billion of them, I could take a scoosal lock on the entire table.</p>
<p>258<br>00:13:12,960 –&gt; 00:13:16,960<br>And then that blocks anybody else from doing anything below, below in the tree.</p>
<p>259<br>00:13:16,960 –&gt; 00:13:26,960<br>But then I, but I don’t think of the lock manager once or I could go down take, you know, take an intention scoosal lock on the table and then take exclusive locks on the individual tuples I want to update.</p>
<p>260<br>00:13:26,960 –&gt; 00:13:30,960<br>But now I got to go to the lock manager every single time I need to acquire those locks.</p>
<p>261<br>00:13:30,960 –&gt; 00:13:31,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>262<br>00:13:31,960 –&gt; 00:13:37,960<br>That again, big picture there isn’t, there’s not math involved in turning that. Just understand the pros and cons of both of them. Yes.</p>
<p>263<br>00:13:37,960 –&gt; 00:13:42,960<br>Specifically by lock escalation, I think it was mentioned in my trip or what was really done.</p>
<p>264<br>00:13:42,960 –&gt; 00:13:50,960<br>The question is, what do I mean by lock escalation? It’d be if I hold in which cases, for what, if I hold a lock in what mode?</p>
<p>265<br>00:13:50,960 –&gt; 00:13:55,960<br>Can I escalate it to a higher mode and when is that allowed?</p>
<p>266<br>00:13:55,960 –&gt; 00:14:04,960<br>So obviously, say ignore intention locks. I hold a shared lock. Can I escalate to automatically to an exclusive lock?</p>
<p>267<br>00:14:04,960 –&gt; 00:14:17,960<br>No, because you don’t know who else may be holding the share lock. Now if nobody else holds the shared lock, which you would know because you have a lock manager, then you could do that.</p>
<p>268<br>00:14:17,960 –&gt; 00:14:23,960<br>High level details. We’re not at there’s no formulas here.</p>
<p>269<br>00:14:23,960 –&gt; 00:14:24,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>270<br>00:14:24,960 –&gt; 00:14:27,960<br>So why would we update the lens?</p>
<p>271<br>00:14:27,960 –&gt; 00:14:31,960<br>It’s question when would you try to upgrade locks?</p>
<p>272<br>00:14:31,960 –&gt; 00:14:38,960<br>If again, don’t think of like a single query coming in and quieting locks and walking away. Think of a multi-query transaction.</p>
<p>273<br>00:14:38,960 –&gt; 00:14:43,960<br>I do a select on something. The application gets the result. Then it comes back and does an update.</p>
<p>274<br>00:14:43,960 –&gt; 00:14:50,960<br>Right. So then I, and I, you know, if I’m doing, I’m doing the, the rigorous to his locking. I hold the lock until the very end.</p>
<p>275<br>00:14:50,960 –&gt; 00:14:56,960<br>So can I go back on the second query and escalate that shared lock into a social lock?</p>
<p>276<br>00:14:56,960 –&gt; 00:15:06,960<br>Right. Yeah. And then we talked about like hints. You can do select for update. You can do a select query and say, oh, by the way, I’m going to update immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>277<br>00:15:06,960 –&gt; 00:15:13,960<br>So take, don’t take share locks. Take a school of locks on the objects I read. So then when the update query comes, it already holds an exclusive mode.</p>
<p>278<br>00:15:14,960 –&gt; 00:15:20,960<br>Right. Again, that’s a low level detail. We don’t know what to worry about.</p>
<p>279<br>00:15:20,960 –&gt; 00:15:25,960<br>Right. So actually, it’s like when we talked about time stamp ordering protocols or optimistic protocols.</p>
<p>280<br>00:15:25,960 –&gt; 00:15:30,960<br>We talked about the basic time stamp ordering, currently told, we talked with this one optimization, the Thomas Wright rule.</p>
<p>281<br>00:15:30,960 –&gt; 00:15:40,960<br>It allows you to write things overwrite, to write objects to objects, even though they’ve been updating the future and you just ignore them.</p>
<p>282<br>00:15:40,960 –&gt; 00:15:48,960<br>We talked about doing OCC, the free phases, the re-phase, validation phase and write phase. And there’s a little very similar to what you’ll see, what you did in the homework.</p>
<p>283<br>00:15:48,960 –&gt; 00:15:54,960<br>And I think we have a question on this on the practice as well. And then we sent time talking about multi-versa-curator control.</p>
<p>284<br>00:15:54,960 –&gt; 00:16:03,960<br>And I’m not so much worried about like, how do you fit in OCC or 2PL in MPCC? It was really the different design decisions you would have in a database system.</p>
<p>285<br>00:16:03,960 –&gt; 00:16:09,960<br>If you want to support multi-versioning, how would you actually organize those versions in storage?</p>
<p>286<br>00:16:09,960 –&gt; 00:16:24,960<br>Do you order the newest oldest oldest newest? How do you do garbage collection, clean up old versions? And then how do you maintain indexes, which may have pointers to different versions?</p>
<p>287<br>00:16:24,960 –&gt; 00:16:45,960<br>Yes. The question is, is OCC an alternative to 2PL? Yes. So most every non-academic system like this. Yeah, pretty much every system.</p>
<p>288<br>00:16:45,960 –&gt; 00:17:09,960<br>There are some active prototypes that kind of blend them. Like if you know, if you know your low-contention, OCC will be better. And then maybe if you add more content, it will automatically switch to 2PL. But like, it’s so hard. You guys just see this in Project 4. It’s so hard. It’s just an implement one of them. Nobody implements two and tries to be clever like that. Everyone just picks one.</p>
<p>289<br>00:17:09,960 –&gt; 00:17:25,960<br>We sometimes have a crash recovery. So this is about, if I have a bunch of changes sitting in memory, when can the buffer pool flush them out? And there’s sort of two denying decisions whether to steal, no steal, or force, or no force.</p>
<p>290<br>00:17:25,960 –&gt; 00:17:38,960<br>Again, steal is when the data systems allow to flush out pages that have been modified by transactions that have not committed yet. And in order to make room for other things you need. And no steal says you can’t do that. You can only flush out data when it’s been committed.</p>
<p>291<br>00:17:38,960 –&gt; 00:17:52,960<br>And then force is, for source of no force is the requirement that I have to flush all the dirty changes from a transaction immediately when it commits before I can tell the outside world that it committed. Or can I do this? Can I defer to some later point?</p>
<p>292<br>00:17:53,960 –&gt; 00:18:07,960<br>So the right-hand logging scheme that we talked about was what was steal versus no steal? Most data systems are an implement steal. Yes. Right. Because otherwise, if I have, if I, if I update more data that can fit memory, I can never do it.</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:07,960 –&gt; 00:18:25,960<br>And now they force versus no force, no force, right? Because again, I can defer the change. I put my right-hand log. Here’s the changes, here’s the changes that I’ve mod, or here’s the modification that made to the data system. That has to get persisted. So then if there’s a crash, you can replay that log and recreate the what was in the buffer pool.</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:26,960 –&gt; 00:18:48,960<br>We talk a little bit about about logging schemes. And again, I’m not the decision to be physical and physiological is not what we’re really worried about. It’s physical or versus logical. Right. The idea that I do, I’m updating in my log, my log records are going to be, here’s like the deltos of the changes I made to individual records or tuples in my database. Or is it the query that I executed?</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:49,960 –&gt; 00:19:06,960<br>Right. And then what are the tradeoffs of the two of them? Like if it’s physical, yeah, I may, may store a lot more data, like my query may update a billion tuples. And therefore, I have a billion wall records for all those one billion updates. And then when I recover, I, you know, I just have to replay all those and logical would be just here’s the single update query.</p>
<p>296<br>00:19:06,960 –&gt; 00:19:08,960<br>Question this.</p>
<p>297<br>00:19:19,960 –&gt; 00:19:26,960<br>His question is in the homework, there was something about no steel, right hand logging using no steel and force.</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:26,960 –&gt; 00:19:33,960<br>Is that the shadow paging? More or less, yes.</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:33,960 –&gt; 00:19:43,960<br>With shadow paging, like because you’re writing to the shadow files, it doesn’t matter, rather actually things get flushed like while you’re still running.</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:43,960 –&gt; 00:19:51,960<br>And no other transaction can see them. But again, very few systems do that.</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:51,960 –&gt; 00:20:01,960<br>All right, we talk about checkpoints, like fuzzy checkpoints versus like stop the world checkpoints. And then we spend time talking about areas against understanding the three phases analyze redo and undo.</p>
<p>302<br>00:20:01,960 –&gt; 00:20:07,960<br>And then what happens to the database system? What makes the changes? What, how does it update the internal state or the metadata?</p>
<p>303<br>00:20:07,960 –&gt; 00:20:11,960<br>It’s, it’s using to keep track of here’s the changes that are being made.</p>
<p>304<br>00:20:11,960 –&gt; 00:20:27,960<br>How do the log sequence numbers of LSNs fit into the protocol? And how do the conversation log records? How are they being used to make sure that if I crash the decision crash is during recovery, I can recover from my recovery.</p>
<p>305<br>00:20:27,960 –&gt; 00:20:37,960<br>And lastly, we talked about distributed databases. And again, because there wasn’t a project based on this and it was sort of a sort of a high level overview of the different topics in the space, right.</p>
<p>306<br>00:20:37,960 –&gt; 00:20:41,960<br>We can’t really ask you deep questions about like how would you actually let this thing and that thing.</p>
<p>307<br>00:20:41,960 –&gt; 00:20:50,960<br>All right, it’s more about what are the different system architectures and primarily the difference between shared disk and shared memory, what are the pros and cons, or what are the trade offs of these different designs?</p>
<p>308<br>00:20:50,960 –&gt; 00:20:58,960<br>How can a devistence replicate this data across different nodes and make sure that it’s always available or can recover if a machine dies.</p>
<p>309<br>00:20:58,960 –&gt; 00:21:07,960<br>The different implications of different partitioning schemes. Again, like if I have a range partitioning, I can do range queries for hash partitioning, I can maybe only do point queries.</p>
<p>310<br>00:21:07,960 –&gt; 00:21:14,960<br>And then basic information like as we asked you in the homework about two basic commit.</p>
<p>311<br>00:21:14,960 –&gt; 00:21:17,960<br>Any questions about any of this? Yes.</p>
<p>312<br>00:21:17,960 –&gt; 00:21:24,960<br>The question is, when will the homework grains be released? We will do that this week. Yes. Probably today.</p>
<p>313<br>00:21:24,960 –&gt; 00:21:38,960<br>The question is, Paxis on there. I mean, not really. Again, we would not show you like, hey, you know, high level questions, two basic commit is enough.</p>
<p>314<br>00:21:38,960 –&gt; 00:21:46,960<br>If you understand two basic commit high level, you would understand Paxis. The difference is that Paxis is a quorum. Two-phase commit is everyone has to agree.</p>
<p>315<br>00:21:46,960 –&gt; 00:21:49,960<br>Other questions?</p>
<p>316<br>00:21:49,960 –&gt; 00:22:02,960<br>All right, so what’s not on exam? Obviously, single store. And then this has come up in previous years where because myself and Dignage will be lecture, we like to say, oh, my sequel does this, a prescription of this or whatever.</p>
<p>317<br>00:22:02,960 –&gt; 00:22:12,960<br>Like, all that is obviously we’re not going to ask about. That’s a color commentary for your own edification, you understand how the concepts we talk about during the semester, map to real world systems.</p>
<p>318<br>00:22:12,960 –&gt; 00:22:15,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>319<br>00:22:15,960 –&gt; 00:22:28,960<br>All right, final exam, Tuesday, a 30am, come to Paxi on 153. And the practice exam is posted on the website. We’ll post the link on Piazza, the files on Piazza after this class.</p>
<p>320<br>00:22:28,960 –&gt; 00:22:32,960<br>And then office hours with the G next to myself on Monday.</p>
<p>321<br>00:22:32,960 –&gt; 00:22:35,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>322<br>00:22:35,960 –&gt; 00:22:39,960<br>Today’s lecture count is like the delta for the world.</p>
<p>323<br>00:22:39,960 –&gt; 00:22:49,960<br>It’s actually like, well, this, what today’s lecture be on the exam? No. This is Andy just ranting about Davis, it’s not.</p>
<p>324<br>00:22:49,960 –&gt; 00:23:00,960<br>If the whole actually you were saying the PL class is basically them ranting about why he hits other programming languages. I like to think I’m getting it’s more than this, right?</p>
<p>325<br>00:23:00,960 –&gt; 00:23:10,960<br>So, no, if any any rants are not on the exam. Other questions?</p>
<p>326<br>00:23:10,960 –&gt; 00:23:18,960<br>All right, so let’s get to the fun stuff. So I don’t, I didn’t make a graph of this because of the what people voted for.</p>
<p>327<br>00:23:18,960 –&gt; 00:23:25,960<br>There was one system that got the most votes will come that in a second.</p>
<p>328<br>00:23:25,960 –&gt; 00:23:32,960<br>Most of this, I realize also too, I probably, in retrospect, I probably should have said here’s the system you could choose from just because the votes were all over the place.</p>
<p>329<br>00:23:32,960 –&gt; 00:23:35,960<br>Like everyone, the most systems got one vote.</p>
<p>330<br>00:23:35,960 –&gt; 00:23:43,960<br>The first system we’re going to cover got the most votes that was the non joke system. So if you know what the joke system was, everyone voted for that.</p>
<p>331<br>00:23:43,960 –&gt; 00:23:48,960<br>But this one got the most votes and then the other two, there was other ones that were also tied in sort of second and third place.</p>
<p>332<br>00:23:48,960 –&gt; 00:23:53,960<br>But I’m recovering the ones that I could put together slides quickly for.</p>
<p>333<br>00:23:53,960 –&gt; 00:23:58,960<br>So the first one’s going to be reddest. This one got the most votes.</p>
<p>334<br>00:23:58,960 –&gt; 00:24:01,960<br>So here, who here has actually used reddest?</p>
<p>335<br>00:24:01,960 –&gt; 00:24:06,960<br>Yeah, a lot. Okay, Houston. Who here has actually written a clone of reddest?</p>
<p>336<br>00:24:06,960 –&gt; 00:24:10,960<br>Nobody. You laugh. That’s what loads a lot of, there’s a lot of clones of this.</p>
<p>337<br>00:24:10,960 –&gt; 00:24:18,960<br>So reddest is considered the canonical no-sequel data system. Like along with Mongo, they sort of came out in the same area.</p>
<p>338<br>00:24:18,960 –&gt; 00:24:23,960<br>So came out in 2009 by this Italian guy. He wrote a lot of it himself.</p>
<p>339<br>00:24:23,960 –&gt; 00:24:26,960<br>It’s a reddest stands for remote dictionary server.</p>
<p>340<br>00:24:26,960 –&gt; 00:24:33,960<br>So at its core, reddest is a single node key value database system written in C.</p>
<p>341<br>00:24:33,960 –&gt; 00:24:42,960<br>And what’s interesting about it is that it, it, it, it, it’s designed to be as fast, you know, do you keep the operations fast as possible?</p>
<p>342<br>00:24:42,960 –&gt; 00:24:47,960<br>So it has a single thread execution engine and all the data resides entirely in memory.</p>
<p>343<br>00:24:47,960 –&gt; 00:24:51,960<br>So the first thing, so this is taking the memory stuff first.</p>
<p>344<br>00:24:51,960 –&gt; 00:24:55,960<br>So, you know, this entire semester has been about disk-oriented DB systems.</p>
<p>345<br>00:24:55,960 –&gt; 00:25:00,960<br>So you have to have a buffer pool and you bring pages in from, from, from memory into, from disk into memory.</p>
<p>346<br>00:25:00,960 –&gt; 00:25:03,960<br>And then there’s a page table, you keep track of where things actually being located.</p>
<p>347<br>00:25:03,960 –&gt; 00:25:13,960<br>Right? All of that requires additional internal latching to make sure that the data structure of the page table and all the other things that’s inside the buffer pool are thread safe.</p>
<p>348<br>00:25:13,960 –&gt; 00:25:15,960<br>Right? But there’s overhead to that.</p>
<p>349<br>00:25:15,960 –&gt; 00:25:28,960<br>And so it, traditionally, if your disk is slow, which historically, it always has been, then you’re okay with taking, paying the penalty of taking those latches in memory because going to disk is so expensive anyway.</p>
<p>350<br>00:25:28,960 –&gt; 00:25:31,960<br>Right? It’s, it’s a, it’s not the high pool intent.</p>
<p>351<br>00:25:31,960 –&gt; 00:25:36,960<br>And so, but now if you say my entire database is going to be in memory, there is no buffer pool.</p>
<p>352<br>00:25:36,960 –&gt; 00:25:40,960<br>Everything I could ever need, any page or any record I want is always in memory.</p>
<p>353<br>00:25:40,960 –&gt; 00:25:47,960<br>Then the cost of acquiring those, those, those latches starts to add up and that becomes the, the more, becomes the bottleneck.</p>
<p>354<br>00:25:47,960 –&gt; 00:25:50,960<br>So in reddus, they say, well, we’re not going to do any of that.</p>
<p>355<br>00:25:50,960 –&gt; 00:25:53,960<br>We’re, we’re, the engine itself is going to be single threaded.</p>
<p>356<br>00:25:53,960 –&gt; 00:25:59,960<br>And there’s only one reader and there’s only one, you know, only one thread can actually be doing anything in the database at a time.</p>
<p>357<br>00:25:59,960 –&gt; 00:26:03,960<br>So therefore, I don’t need those latches. I don’t need any internal data structures to keep track of things.</p>
<p>358<br>00:26:03,960 –&gt; 00:26:06,960<br>I basically can almost run as bare metal speed.</p>
<p>359<br>00:26:06,960 –&gt; 00:26:12,960<br>This is why reddus is, historically, been known as one, you know, one of the faster database systems.</p>
<p>360<br>00:26:12,960 –&gt; 00:26:18,960<br>So, what’s also interesting about reddus is that beyond is being, there’s a bunch of other key value stores that are out there.</p>
<p>361<br>00:26:18,960 –&gt; 00:26:23,960<br>But what they do that, which is interesting is that they actually have specialized value types.</p>
<p>362<br>00:26:23,960 –&gt; 00:26:28,960<br>Right? So, so when I say a, sort of generic key value store would be, here’s my key and here’s my value.</p>
<p>363<br>00:26:28,960 –&gt; 00:26:31,960<br>And the value is just a blob, right? A, some, some byte stream.</p>
<p>364<br>00:26:31,960 –&gt; 00:26:34,960<br>The data center doesn’t know anything about what’s inside of it.</p>
<p>365<br>00:26:34,960 –&gt; 00:26:38,960<br>And so anytime you want to interpret within that byte stream, you got to do this in application code.</p>
<p>366<br>00:26:38,960 –&gt; 00:26:44,960<br>So in reddus, their values could be either strings or hashes or integers or lists or sets.</p>
<p>367<br>00:26:45,960 –&gt; 00:26:54,960<br>And then they have specific commands that can do manipulation on those data structures within a single, you know, round trip update.</p>
<p>368<br>00:26:54,960 –&gt; 00:26:59,960<br>Instead of having to bring stuff in the application, modify stuff and then push it back out.</p>
<p>369<br>00:26:59,960 –&gt; 00:27:05,960<br>So that part is interesting. That, that part is, is other than, there were a bunch of clones of reddus.</p>
<p>370<br>00:27:05,960 –&gt; 00:27:09,960<br>But that, I think that part of reddus was novel when it came out.</p>
<p>371<br>00:27:09,960 –&gt; 00:27:15,960<br>Because it’s in memory, we’ll talk in a second how they handle, make sure that their data is persistent.</p>
<p>372<br>00:27:15,960 –&gt; 00:27:21,960<br>In the real world, I come across reddus being primarily used as a cache.</p>
<p>373<br>00:27:21,960 –&gt; 00:27:25,960<br>Right? So you would have your regular Davies system, my SQL, Postgres, Mongo, whatever you want.</p>
<p>374<br>00:27:25,960 –&gt; 00:27:30,960<br>And then you would have this cache, this, this cache on the side, the side card cache.</p>
<p>375<br>00:27:30,960 –&gt; 00:27:33,960<br>And then your application would say, oh, I need to get this key.</p>
<p>376<br>00:27:33,960 –&gt; 00:27:36,960<br>Set them to go to the Davies system run in the query. I’ll go check reddus.</p>
<p>377<br>00:27:36,960 –&gt; 00:27:40,960<br>If it’s there, great others use that. If not, then I’ll go to the Davies system.</p>
<p>378<br>00:27:40,960 –&gt; 00:27:43,960<br>So it’s a way to avoid having to do a bunch of additional operations.</p>
<p>379<br>00:27:43,960 –&gt; 00:27:46,960<br>Davies system, which would be expensive to do.</p>
<p>380<br>00:27:46,960 –&gt; 00:27:54,960<br>So I was joking before I asked him why anybody has written a clone because there’s, there’s a ton of these like hobby projects that are out there where people like,</p>
<p>381<br>00:27:54,960 –&gt; 00:27:59,960<br>you know, they have lettuce because it’s, you know, they were, whatever programming language you can think of,</p>
<p>382<br>00:27:59,960 –&gt; 00:28:02,960<br>take the first letter of that programming language and there, and there’ll be a reddus clone.</p>
<p>383<br>00:28:02,960 –&gt; 00:28:07,960<br>Like there’s jettis and like there’s, there’s, with the J or G or go or job it right.</p>
<p>384<br>00:28:07,960 –&gt; 00:28:09,960<br>There’s a bunch of these clones of them.</p>
<p>385<br>00:28:09,960 –&gt; 00:28:16,960<br>These are, these key B and dragify that to how the two most developed, other tenders out of ten set as well.</p>
<p>386<br>00:28:16,960 –&gt; 00:28:21,960<br>These probably the two most well developed extensions or rewrites of reddus.</p>
<p>387<br>00:28:21,960 –&gt; 00:28:24,960<br>Actually, key B, key B was Canadian. They got bought by,</p>
<p>388<br>00:28:25,960 –&gt; 00:28:31,960<br>what’s the other, not Instagram, what’s the other social media with Hig Photos with the ghost?</p>
<p>389<br>00:28:31,960 –&gt; 00:28:33,960<br>Snapchat, yeah, they go bought by Snapchat.</p>
<p>390<br>00:28:33,960 –&gt; 00:28:36,960<br>Oh, they did, they fucking put a latch in front of it, right?</p>
<p>391<br>00:28:36,960 –&gt; 00:28:40,960<br>So they say they’re, they can do, sort of set it being single threaded, it’s multi threaded, but they just put a latch, right?</p>
<p>392<br>00:28:40,960 –&gt; 00:28:42,960<br>And they got acquired for that.</p>
<p>393<br>00:28:42,960 –&gt; 00:28:44,960<br>Drag and fly is complete rewrite.</p>
<p>394<br>00:28:44,960 –&gt; 00:28:47,960<br>Tendus is ten cent, I think it’s open source. I don’t know whether they fork it or not.</p>
<p>395<br>00:28:47,960 –&gt; 00:28:52,960<br>But there’s a, again, if you go to DBDO, if you go click the compatibility with reddus, there’s a ton of these systems.</p>
<p>396<br>00:28:52,960 –&gt; 00:28:54,960<br>And there’s a bunch of them I don’t even put on.</p>
<p>397<br>00:28:54,960 –&gt; 00:29:00,960<br>And there’s some, there’s some company where they’ll sell you basically a course like 445,</p>
<p>398<br>00:29:00,960 –&gt; 00:29:02,960<br>where you basically learn how to write your own reddus clone.</p>
<p>399<br>00:29:02,960 –&gt; 00:29:03,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>400<br>00:29:03,960 –&gt; 00:29:06,960<br>How did you handle variable length types and both of them?</p>
<p>401<br>00:29:06,960 –&gt; 00:29:09,960<br>Like, the kind of direction, it’s the display.</p>
<p>402<br>00:29:09,960 –&gt; 00:29:10,960<br>So how did they handle what, sorry?</p>
<p>403<br>00:29:10,960 –&gt; 00:29:11,960<br>A variable length.</p>
<p>404<br>00:29:11,960 –&gt; 00:29:13,960<br>If it’s what, sorry, if what?</p>
<p>405<br>00:29:13,960 –&gt; 00:29:15,960<br>Like, because the strings are happy to go variable length.</p>
<p>406<br>00:29:15,960 –&gt; 00:29:16,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>407<br>00:29:16,960 –&gt; 00:29:17,960<br>How did they handle it?</p>
<p>408<br>00:29:17,960 –&gt; 00:29:18,960<br>It’s a hashable.</p>
<p>409<br>00:29:18,960 –&gt; 00:29:19,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>410<br>00:29:19,960 –&gt; 00:29:22,960<br>We’ll give that in a second.</p>
<p>411<br>00:29:22,960 –&gt; 00:29:23,960<br>Right. Yes.</p>
<p>412<br>00:29:23,960 –&gt; 00:29:25,960<br>What do you think added a match?</p>
<p>413<br>00:29:25,960 –&gt; 00:29:26,960<br>Like global latch?</p>
<p>414<br>00:29:26,960 –&gt; 00:29:31,960<br>So like they would have, yeah, they had a global latch in front of the data structure.</p>
<p>415<br>00:29:31,960 –&gt; 00:29:32,960<br>Can my student look at this?</p>
<p>416<br>00:29:32,960 –&gt; 00:29:33,960<br>It’s a global latch in front of the data structure.</p>
<p>417<br>00:29:33,960 –&gt; 00:29:36,960<br>So you can have multiple, multiple updates come in, right?</p>
<p>418<br>00:29:36,960 –&gt; 00:29:39,960<br>But then still, there’s still a latch in front of the data structure.</p>
<p>419<br>00:29:39,960 –&gt; 00:29:47,960<br>I mean, like, it’s concurrent network connection.</p>
<p>420<br>00:29:47,960 –&gt; 00:29:48,960<br>I don’t know.</p>
<p>421<br>00:29:48,960 –&gt; 00:29:49,960<br>Huh?</p>
<p>422<br>00:29:49,960 –&gt; 00:29:50,960<br>It might allow multiple reads.</p>
<p>423<br>00:29:50,960 –&gt; 00:29:51,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>424<br>00:29:51,960 –&gt; 00:29:52,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>425<br>00:29:52,960 –&gt; 00:29:53,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>426<br>00:29:53,960 –&gt; 00:29:56,960<br>So here’s what keys look like.</p>
<p>427<br>00:29:56,960 –&gt; 00:29:57,960<br>Right?</p>
<p>428<br>00:29:57,960 –&gt; 00:29:58,960<br>It’s just, there’s like strings.</p>
<p>429<br>00:29:58,960 –&gt; 00:30:09,960<br>And then you have different, you know, different, uh, nomenclatures, which are just corresponded</p>
<p>430<br>00:30:09,960 –&gt; 00:30:11,960<br>like, is it a, like, well, here’s it.</p>
<p>431<br>00:30:11,960 –&gt; 00:30:16,960<br>If you want a sorted set, a hash table, you get a list, a set, and then there’s regular strings</p>
<p>432<br>00:30:16,960 –&gt; 00:30:17,960<br>that have been stored there.</p>
<p>433<br>00:30:17,960 –&gt; 00:30:18,960<br>Right?</p>
<p>434<br>00:30:18,960 –&gt; 00:30:19,960<br>And then the other side here, these are his values.</p>
<p>435<br>00:30:19,960 –&gt; 00:30:22,960<br>Well, we can give a quick demo what this looks like.</p>
<p>436<br>00:30:22,960 –&gt; 00:30:25,960<br>Um, and so red is by default doesn’t support SQL.</p>
<p>437<br>00:30:25,960 –&gt; 00:30:28,960<br>Um, there is, there was a red is SQL.</p>
<p>438<br>00:30:28,960 –&gt; 00:30:31,960<br>There was like, yeah, there’s people take red is they put SQL and stuff on top of it.</p>
<p>439<br>00:30:31,960 –&gt; 00:30:33,960<br>Uh, they put graph, apis on top of it.</p>
<p>440<br>00:30:33,960 –&gt; 00:30:38,960<br>Um, the, the entire guy that originally started writing red is he no longer works in the project.</p>
<p>441<br>00:30:38,960 –&gt; 00:30:39,960<br>I don’t know what, I don’t know what he’s doing now.</p>
<p>442<br>00:30:39,960 –&gt; 00:30:44,960<br>And then there’s a, there was a company that was doing hosted red is called red is labs.</p>
<p>443<br>00:30:44,960 –&gt; 00:30:49,960<br>I think they bought the red is name and now they’re just called red is the company and they’re</p>
<p>444<br>00:30:49,960 –&gt; 00:30:54,960<br>trying to commercialize red is and what they’re basically trying to do is go beyond the,</p>
<p>445<br>00:30:54,960 –&gt; 00:30:59,960<br>sort of break the mind share thought or the perception that red is is only used as a cache.</p>
<p>446<br>00:30:59,960 –&gt; 00:31:03,960<br>And they’re trying to build a bunch of apis in front of it so you could use it as your primary storage database.</p>
<p>447<br>00:31:03,960 –&gt; 00:31:06,960<br>And it remains to be seen how successful they will be.</p>
<p>448<br>00:31:06,960 –&gt; 00:31:08,960<br>So again, it doesn’t work SQL.</p>
<p>449<br>00:31:08,960 –&gt; 00:31:13,960<br>So instead you get a bunch of just these commands that do very specific operations on,</p>
<p>450<br>00:31:13,960 –&gt; 00:31:16,960<br>uh, the different data types, right?</p>
<p>451<br>00:31:16,960 –&gt; 00:31:23,960<br>Uh, and so in your application code, you have to be able to specify or know like I’m doing,</p>
<p>452<br>00:31:23,960 –&gt; 00:31:26,960<br>you know, I’m operating on a key that looks at this type.</p>
<p>453<br>00:31:26,960 –&gt; 00:31:28,960<br>And therefore I can only run these commands.</p>
<p>454<br>00:31:28,960 –&gt; 00:31:30,960<br>Otherwise, it will throw an error.</p>
<p>455<br>00:31:30,960 –&gt; 00:31:33,960<br>Um, again, I only learned red is last night.</p>
<p>456<br>00:31:33,960 –&gt; 00:31:34,960<br>So let’s see how it goes.</p>
<p>457<br>00:31:34,960 –&gt; 00:31:36,960<br>Um,</p>
<p>458<br>00:31:36,960 –&gt; 00:31:46,960<br>let’s see.</p>
<p>459<br>00:31:46,960 –&gt; 00:31:47,960<br>Uh, materialize.</p>
<p>460<br>00:31:47,960 –&gt; 00:31:48,960<br>Sorry.</p>
<p>461<br>00:31:48,960 –&gt; 00:31:51,960<br>I want to go to eight.</p>
<p>462<br>00:31:51,960 –&gt; 00:31:52,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>463<br>00:31:52,960 –&gt; 00:31:55,960<br>So, uh, you can do something that’s like set.</p>
<p>464<br>00:31:55,960 –&gt; 00:31:59,960<br>This is a command interface that has a nice, uh, like, you know, suggestions.</p>
<p>465<br>00:31:59,960 –&gt; 00:32:00,960<br>So do a key.</p>
<p>466<br>00:32:00,960 –&gt; 00:32:02,960<br>You call your class.</p>
<p>467<br>00:32:02,960 –&gt; 00:32:04,960<br>And we’ll put ABC in.</p>
<p>468<br>00:32:04,960 –&gt; 00:32:06,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>469<br>00:32:06,960 –&gt; 00:32:10,960<br>So now if I call get ABC.</p>
<p>470<br>00:32:10,960 –&gt; 00:32:14,960<br>Oh, sorry, get key.</p>
<p>471<br>00:32:14,960 –&gt; 00:32:16,960<br>Class.</p>
<p>472<br>00:32:16,960 –&gt; 00:32:17,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>473<br>00:32:17,960 –&gt; 00:32:18,960<br>I get that back.</p>
<p>474<br>00:32:18,960 –&gt; 00:32:28,960<br>Um, then you can do other things like you can do.</p>
<p>475<br>00:32:28,960 –&gt; 00:32:29,960<br>This is me trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>476<br>00:32:29,960 –&gt; 00:32:30,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>477<br>00:32:30,960 –&gt; 00:32:32,960<br>So they have incremental, they have increments.</p>
<p>478<br>00:32:32,960 –&gt; 00:32:36,960<br>So you can define like a, um,</p>
<p>479<br>00:32:36,960 –&gt; 00:32:40,960<br>you can divide, you basically define a counter, right.</p>
<p>480<br>00:32:40,960 –&gt; 00:32:44,960<br>So I can say increment.</p>
<p>481<br>00:32:44,960 –&gt; 00:32:45,960<br>And then we’ll give it a counter.</p>
<p>482<br>00:32:45,960 –&gt; 00:32:48,960<br>We’ll call it counter X.</p>
<p>483<br>00:32:48,960 –&gt; 00:32:49,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>484<br>00:32:49,960 –&gt; 00:32:52,960<br>And every time I call that command, it’ll automatically add one to it.</p>
<p>485<br>00:32:52,960 –&gt; 00:32:53,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>486<br>00:32:53,960 –&gt; 00:32:54,960<br>So think of like it’s a game.</p>
<p>487<br>00:32:54,960 –&gt; 00:32:55,960<br>You’re keeping track of score or something.</p>
<p>488<br>00:32:55,960 –&gt; 00:32:56,960<br>You do things like that.</p>
<p>489<br>00:32:56,960 –&gt; 00:32:57,960<br>What’s kind of funky?</p>
<p>490<br>00:32:57,960 –&gt; 00:33:00,960<br>You can put a number in front of this and say I went increment it five times.</p>
<p>491<br>00:33:00,960 –&gt; 00:33:01,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>492<br>00:33:01,960 –&gt; 00:33:07,960<br>Um, if I call get, I should be able to get the current value counter X.</p>
<p>493<br>00:33:07,960 –&gt; 00:33:08,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>494<br>00:33:08,960 –&gt; 00:33:10,960<br>What’s interesting here.</p>
<p>495<br>00:33:10,960 –&gt; 00:33:12,960<br>I am assuming here that they’re returning back.</p>
<p>496<br>00:33:12,960 –&gt; 00:33:14,960<br>Hey, the type is an integer when I call increment.</p>
<p>497<br>00:33:14,960 –&gt; 00:33:18,960<br>But when I call get, I get the response back as a string.</p>
<p>498<br>00:33:18,960 –&gt; 00:33:19,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>499<br>00:33:19,960 –&gt; 00:33:22,960<br>So I think they’re storing everything is strings.</p>
<p>500<br>00:33:22,960 –&gt; 00:33:25,960<br>And then I can’t actually I said, sorry, take that.</p>
<p>501<br>00:33:25,960 –&gt; 00:33:29,960<br>The wire protocol says everything back as a string in and out as a string.</p>
<p>502<br>00:33:29,960 –&gt; 00:33:34,960<br>They must be doing something here to cast it or store it natively as an integer on the server side.</p>
<p>503<br>00:33:34,960 –&gt; 00:33:37,960<br>But I haven’t looked at the source code to figure that out.</p>
<p>504<br>00:33:37,960 –&gt; 00:33:40,960<br>Um, but let’s make a list now.</p>
<p>505<br>00:33:40,960 –&gt; 00:33:43,960<br>So.</p>
<p>506<br>00:33:43,960 –&gt; 00:33:51,960<br>Get key.</p>
<p>507<br>00:33:51,960 –&gt; 00:33:52,960<br>Scan.</p>
<p>508<br>00:33:52,960 –&gt; 00:33:53,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>509<br>00:33:53,960 –&gt; 00:33:54,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>510<br>00:33:54,960 –&gt; 00:33:55,960<br>So here we’ll make a list.</p>
<p>511<br>00:33:55,960 –&gt; 00:33:57,960<br>We’ll call list X.</p>
<p>512<br>00:33:57,960 –&gt; 00:34:03,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>513<br>00:34:03,960 –&gt; 00:34:08,960<br>And then I can add something else.</p>
<p>514<br>00:34:08,960 –&gt; 00:34:09,960<br>So, all right.</p>
<p>515<br>00:34:09,960 –&gt; 00:34:11,960<br>So when I was doing this last time, okay, great.</p>
<p>516<br>00:34:11,960 –&gt; 00:34:12,960<br>I got a list.</p>
<p>517<br>00:34:12,960 –&gt; 00:34:13,960<br>Give me back the list.</p>
<p>518<br>00:34:13,960 –&gt; 00:34:16,960<br>So I thought, okay, I’ll do list X.</p>
<p>519<br>00:34:16,960 –&gt; 00:34:17,960<br>Doesn’t like that.</p>
<p>520<br>00:34:17,960 –&gt; 00:34:18,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>521<br>00:34:18,960 –&gt; 00:34:20,960<br>Because it knows that it’s a list.</p>
<p>522<br>00:34:20,960 –&gt; 00:34:26,960<br>And I’m asking for a command that’s not on that for like basic, by repairs and not list.</p>
<p>523<br>00:34:26,960 –&gt; 00:34:31,960<br>So this is actually goes back to something that’s had very, very beginning about, uh, Y SQL and relational models a good idea.</p>
<p>524<br>00:34:31,960 –&gt; 00:34:36,960<br>And that there was earlier systems that had these APIs were based on the type or the value restoring.</p>
<p>525<br>00:34:36,960 –&gt; 00:34:38,960<br>You had one set of commands or some other set of commands.</p>
<p>526<br>00:34:38,960 –&gt; 00:34:42,960<br>To me, it seems perfectly reasonable to say, hey, get me that list.</p>
<p>527<br>00:34:42,960 –&gt; 00:34:43,960<br>But no, you can’t do that.</p>
<p>528<br>00:34:43,960 –&gt; 00:34:44,960<br>It doesn’t let you to do that.</p>
<p>529<br>00:34:44,960 –&gt; 00:34:45,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>530<br>00:34:45,960 –&gt; 00:34:50,960<br>Because it’s not storing any potentially any information on the server side about what the type actually is.</p>
<p>531<br>00:34:50,960 –&gt; 00:34:53,960<br>So it’s relying on you, the application to know what command you should call it on.</p>
<p>532<br>00:34:53,960 –&gt; 00:34:56,960<br>You just call on a different data type.</p>
<p>533<br>00:34:56,960 –&gt; 00:34:57,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>534<br>00:34:57,960 –&gt; 00:35:01,960<br>So like, if now I do this, let’s see if I let me do this.</p>
<p>535<br>00:35:01,960 –&gt; 00:35:06,960<br>What if I call list X now, you know, one, two, three.</p>
<p>536<br>00:35:06,960 –&gt; 00:35:07,960<br>Let me do that.</p>
<p>537<br>00:35:07,960 –&gt; 00:35:09,960<br>But now I can call.</p>
<p>538<br>00:35:09,960 –&gt; 00:35:11,960<br>Now I get it back.</p>
<p>539<br>00:35:11,960 –&gt; 00:35:12,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>540<br>00:35:12,960 –&gt; 00:35:14,960<br>The data system let me do that.</p>
<p>541<br>00:35:14,960 –&gt; 00:35:17,960<br>And so that means that someone makes mistakes in your application code.</p>
<p>542<br>00:35:17,960 –&gt; 00:35:18,960<br>It doesn’t know that it’s calling.</p>
<p>543<br>00:35:19,960 –&gt; 00:35:24,960<br>You know, it’s calling certain commands based on a list type versus a regular type.</p>
<p>544<br>00:35:24,960 –&gt; 00:35:28,960<br>You might break your, you know, break your database when you’re in your data.</p>
<p>545<br>00:35:28,960 –&gt; 00:35:33,960<br>So this is a great example of like Y schemas and Y of the relational model is a good idea.</p>
<p>546<br>00:35:33,960 –&gt; 00:35:36,960<br>Because your post because my SQL won’t let you do that.</p>
<p>547<br>00:35:36,960 –&gt; 00:35:39,960<br>Furthermore, it’s a select.</p>
<p>548<br>00:35:39,960 –&gt; 00:35:42,960<br>You don’t care in your query what the data type actually is.</p>
<p>549<br>00:35:42,960 –&gt; 00:35:45,960<br>You just say, give me these results and get it back.</p>
<p>550<br>00:35:45,960 –&gt; 00:35:48,960<br>Now yeah, there’s certain function to call that you have to know what type it is.</p>
<p>551<br>00:35:48,960 –&gt; 00:35:51,960<br>And it made it his own tries to do type inference and other things of the cast stuff.</p>
<p>552<br>00:35:51,960 –&gt; 00:35:56,960<br>But to me, that seems bizarre that I can’t call get on a list.</p>
<p>553<br>00:35:56,960 –&gt; 00:35:57,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>554<br>00:35:57,960 –&gt; 00:35:59,960<br>To me, that seems wrong.</p>
<p>555<br>00:35:59,960 –&gt; 00:36:03,960<br>So then the way you get it back, I think it took a while to figure this out.</p>
<p>556<br>00:36:03,960 –&gt; 00:36:05,960<br>Yeah, here.</p>
<p>557<br>00:36:05,960 –&gt; 00:36:08,960<br>The way you get it back was you have to call this L range.</p>
<p>558<br>00:36:08,960 –&gt; 00:36:09,960<br>So it’s a list range.</p>
<p>559<br>00:36:09,960 –&gt; 00:36:10,960<br>And I went from zero.</p>
<p>560<br>00:36:10,960 –&gt; 00:36:14,960<br>And then it’s like the Python syntax for like negative one is the last item list.</p>
<p>561<br>00:36:14,960 –&gt; 00:36:15,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>562<br>00:36:15,960 –&gt; 00:36:17,960<br>Oh, yeah, see if I broke it.</p>
<p>563<br>00:36:17,960 –&gt; 00:36:18,960<br>So now I got to go back.</p>
<p>564<br>00:36:18,960 –&gt; 00:36:19,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>565<br>00:36:19,960 –&gt; 00:36:20,960<br>Can’t do that.</p>
<p>566<br>00:36:20,960 –&gt; 00:36:23,960<br>So make it make a new list.</p>
<p>567<br>00:36:23,960 –&gt; 00:36:24,960<br>Um.</p>
<p>568<br>00:36:24,960 –&gt; 00:36:28,960<br>List Y.</p>
<p>569<br>00:36:28,960 –&gt; 00:36:39,960<br>And then now.</p>
<p>570<br>00:36:39,960 –&gt; 00:36:40,960<br>I missed it.</p>
<p>571<br>00:36:40,960 –&gt; 00:36:41,960<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>572<br>00:36:41,960 –&gt; 00:36:42,960<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>573<br>00:36:42,960 –&gt; 00:36:45,960<br>I used my laptop type instead of this.</p>
<p>574<br>00:36:45,960 –&gt; 00:36:46,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>575<br>00:36:46,960 –&gt; 00:36:48,960<br>Then I get to list back.</p>
<p>576<br>00:36:48,960 –&gt; 00:36:49,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>577<br>00:36:49,960 –&gt; 00:36:52,960<br>So that’s.</p>
<p>578<br>00:36:52,960 –&gt; 00:36:53,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>579<br>00:36:53,960 –&gt; 00:36:55,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>580<br>00:36:55,960 –&gt; 00:36:56,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>581<br>00:36:56,960 –&gt; 00:36:57,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>582<br>00:36:57,960 –&gt; 00:36:58,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>583<br>00:36:58,960 –&gt; 00:36:59,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>584<br>00:36:59,960 –&gt; 00:37:00,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>585<br>00:37:00,960 –&gt; 00:37:01,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>586<br>00:37:01,960 –&gt; 00:37:02,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>587<br>00:37:02,960 –&gt; 00:37:03,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>588<br>00:37:03,960 –&gt; 00:37:04,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>589<br>00:37:04,960 –&gt; 00:37:05,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>590<br>00:37:05,960 –&gt; 00:37:06,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>591<br>00:37:06,960 –&gt; 00:37:07,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>592<br>00:37:07,960 –&gt; 00:37:08,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>593<br>00:37:08,960 –&gt; 00:37:09,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>594<br>00:37:09,960 –&gt; 00:37:10,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>595<br>00:37:10,960 –&gt; 00:37:11,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>596<br>00:37:11,960 –&gt; 00:37:12,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>597<br>00:37:12,960 –&gt; 00:37:13,960<br>It’s David is,</p>
<p>598<br>00:37:13,960 –&gt; 00:37:15,960<br>If I add a adding SQL,</p>
<p>599<br>00:37:15,960 –&gt; 00:37:18,960<br>and an relational model on top of the system,</p>
<p>600<br>00:37:18,960 –&gt; 00:37:20,960<br>like we have a bus top or other systems,</p>
<p>601<br>00:37:20,960 –&gt; 00:37:21,960<br>wouldn’t this be,</p>
<p>602<br>00:37:21,960 –&gt; 00:37:27,960<br>wouldn’t that slow things down because you at the parts of querying all that subject?</p>
<p>603<br>00:37:27,960 –&gt; 00:37:28,960<br>Absolutely.</p>
<p>604<br>00:37:28,960 –&gt; 00:37:29,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>605<br>00:37:29,960 –&gt; 00:37:30,960<br>So for like simple things,</p>
<p>606<br>00:37:30,960 –&gt; 00:37:32,960<br>like a key value store for a cash.</p>
<p>607<br>00:37:32,960 –&gt; 00:37:33,960<br>Sure.</p>
<p>608<br>00:37:33,960 –&gt; 00:37:34,960<br>That’s fine.</p>
<p>609<br>00:37:34,960 –&gt; 00:37:39,960<br>But if you to use this as your primary database and not have something enforce your schema.</p>
<p>610<br>00:37:39,960 –&gt; 00:37:43,960<br>to protect you from shooting yourself in the foot like it did just now.</p>
<p>611<br>00:37:43,960 –&gt; 00:37:45,960<br>That’s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>612<br>00:37:45,960 –&gt; 00:37:48,960<br>It’ll help you get stuff up and running very quickly,</p>
<p>613<br>00:37:48,960 –&gt; 00:37:51,960<br>but think of like five years from now, 10 years from now.</p>
<p>614<br>00:37:51,960 –&gt; 00:37:54,960<br>You’re dead or whatever, you’ve been fired,</p>
<p>615<br>00:37:54,960 –&gt; 00:37:56,960<br>you’re not working application anymore.</p>
<p>616<br>00:37:56,960 –&gt; 00:37:59,960<br>Somebody else is picking up your code and they got to deal with your clusterfuck.</p>
<p>617<br>00:37:59,960 –&gt; 00:38:03,960<br>So having things that prevent humans from doing stupid things</p>
<p>618<br>00:38:03,960 –&gt; 00:38:06,960<br>for a primary source database is a good idea.</p>
<p>619<br>00:38:06,960 –&gt; 00:38:09,960<br>For a cache, like if the key is just a session ID</p>
<p>620<br>00:38:09,960 –&gt; 00:38:11,960<br>and you get back JSON or whatever, that’s fine.</p>
<p>621<br>00:38:11,960 –&gt; 00:38:12,960<br>I don’t care.</p>
<p>622<br>00:38:12,960 –&gt; 00:38:14,960<br>The second question,</p>
<p>623<br>00:38:14,960 –&gt; 00:38:16,960<br>is there an other system that has been got?</p>
<p>624<br>00:38:16,960 –&gt; 00:38:18,960<br>What is called a cache?</p>
<p>625<br>00:38:18,960 –&gt; 00:38:19,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>626<br>00:38:19,960 –&gt; 00:38:21,960<br>Is there a code that has been added for the board?</p>
<p>627<br>00:38:21,960 –&gt; 00:38:23,960<br>Like, I know maybe it’s called the one that’s moving,</p>
<p>628<br>00:38:23,960 –&gt; 00:38:26,960<br>but if you want to extend it to an edge,</p>
<p>629<br>00:38:26,960 –&gt; 00:38:27,960<br>then it’s a good idea.</p>
<p>630<br>00:38:27,960 –&gt; 00:38:29,960<br>Yeah, so the question is,</p>
<p>631<br>00:38:29,960 –&gt; 00:38:31,960<br>I’m saying red is just a cache,</p>
<p>632<br>00:38:31,960 –&gt; 00:38:33,960<br>but there’s another famous cache,</p>
<p>633<br>00:38:33,960 –&gt; 00:38:36,960<br>a distributed cache called memcache d,</p>
<p>634<br>00:38:36,960 –&gt; 00:38:38,960<br>that came out of live journal.</p>
<p>635<br>00:38:38,960 –&gt; 00:38:39,960<br>If you know what that,</p>
<p>636<br>00:38:39,960 –&gt; 00:38:41,960<br>think of like,</p>
<p>637<br>00:38:41,960 –&gt; 00:38:43,960<br>before Tumblr, if you know what Tumblr was,</p>
<p>638<br>00:38:43,960 –&gt; 00:38:45,960<br>before Medium, right?</p>
<p>639<br>00:38:45,960 –&gt; 00:38:47,960<br>There’s Medium now,</p>
<p>640<br>00:38:47,960 –&gt; 00:38:48,960<br>or Substack,</p>
<p>641<br>00:38:48,960 –&gt; 00:38:50,960<br>and then there was Tumblr with the hot bang,</p>
<p>642<br>00:38:50,960 –&gt; 00:38:52,960<br>and then before that was live journal.</p>
<p>643<br>00:38:52,960 –&gt; 00:38:54,960<br>It still exists, I think, for the furries or whatever.</p>
<p>644<br>00:38:54,960 –&gt; 00:38:57,960<br>They built this distributed cache called memcache d,</p>
<p>645<br>00:38:57,960 –&gt; 00:39:00,960<br>and it is a consistent hash table</p>
<p>646<br>00:39:00,960 –&gt; 00:39:03,960<br>that does to basically get and sets.</p>
<p>647<br>00:39:03,960 –&gt; 00:39:05,960<br>So what memcache d, as far as I know,</p>
<p>648<br>00:39:05,960 –&gt; 00:39:07,960<br>they only support get set and leads.</p>
<p>649<br>00:39:07,960 –&gt; 00:39:09,960<br>Redis has all these, I showed the commands,</p>
<p>650<br>00:39:09,960 –&gt; 00:39:12,960<br>does all these other detailed commands you could do</p>
<p>651<br>00:39:12,960 –&gt; 00:39:13,960<br>on different data types.</p>
<p>652<br>00:39:13,960 –&gt; 00:39:15,960<br>I think that’s why this would be different.</p>
<p>653<br>00:39:15,960 –&gt; 00:39:16,960<br>Now, the question is,</p>
<p>654<br>00:39:16,960 –&gt; 00:39:17,960<br>can you make redis distributed?</p>
<p>655<br>00:39:17,960 –&gt; 00:39:20,960<br>Yes, there is a distributed version of redis.</p>
<p>656<br>00:39:20,960 –&gt; 00:39:23,960<br>I don’t know whether it’s a middleware on the front</p>
<p>657<br>00:39:23,960 –&gt; 00:39:27,960<br>or whether you can read and write to any node.</p>
<p>658<br>00:39:27,960 –&gt; 00:39:29,960<br>I don’t know how it works.</p>
<p>659<br>00:39:29,960 –&gt; 00:39:30,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>660<br>00:39:30,960 –&gt; 00:39:33,960<br>I was going to mention that it can be used in memory cache</p>
<p>661<br>00:39:33,960 –&gt; 00:39:36,960<br>to cache something that’s not used to create data.</p>
<p>662<br>00:39:36,960 –&gt; 00:39:37,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>663<br>00:39:37,960 –&gt; 00:39:39,960<br>So who does want to be distributed in the case of</p>
<p>664<br>00:39:39,960 –&gt; 00:39:41,960<br>making things interesting?</p>
<p>665<br>00:39:41,960 –&gt; 00:39:42,960<br>So his question is,</p>
<p>666<br>00:39:42,960 –&gt; 00:39:43,960<br>in my scenario,</p>
<p>667<br>00:39:43,960 –&gt; 00:39:45,960<br>where you said you had a redis as a cache,</p>
<p>668<br>00:39:45,960 –&gt; 00:39:47,960<br>and then Postgres or Royard Davidson as the primary storage,</p>
<p>669<br>00:39:47,960 –&gt; 00:39:49,960<br>who’s responsible for maintaining the cache,</p>
<p>670<br>00:39:49,960 –&gt; 00:39:51,960<br>the application code?</p>
<p>671<br>00:39:51,960 –&gt; 00:39:53,960<br>It’s a sidecar cache,</p>
<p>672<br>00:39:53,960 –&gt; 00:39:55,960<br>not a right-through cache.</p>
<p>673<br>00:39:55,960 –&gt; 00:39:56,960<br>A right-through cache would be like,</p>
<p>674<br>00:39:56,960 –&gt; 00:39:57,960<br>sits in front of the system,</p>
<p>675<br>00:39:57,960 –&gt; 00:39:58,960<br>if you’re right,</p>
<p>676<br>00:39:58,960 –&gt; 00:40:00,960<br>and then it gets propagated to the data system.</p>
<p>677<br>00:40:00,960 –&gt; 00:40:02,960<br>Redis doesn’t support SQL,</p>
<p>678<br>00:40:02,960 –&gt; 00:40:03,960<br>doesn’t support any of that.</p>
<p>679<br>00:40:03,960 –&gt; 00:40:04,960<br>So in the application code,</p>
<p>680<br>00:40:04,960 –&gt; 00:40:06,960<br>your response will be doing that.</p>
<p>681<br>00:40:06,960 –&gt; 00:40:07,960<br>So that means, of course, again,</p>
<p>682<br>00:40:07,960 –&gt; 00:40:08,960<br>that if you now do an update,</p>
<p>683<br>00:40:08,960 –&gt; 00:40:09,960<br>and something gets invalidated,</p>
<p>684<br>00:40:09,960 –&gt; 00:40:13,960<br>you have to send a delete request to the cache.</p>
<p>685<br>00:40:13,960 –&gt; 00:40:14,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>686<br>00:40:14,960 –&gt; 00:40:15,960<br>So you said that there,</p>
<p>687<br>00:40:15,960 –&gt; 00:40:16,960<br>providing the system,</p>
<p>688<br>00:40:16,960 –&gt; 00:40:20,960<br>what does it not make it so much better?</p>
<p>689<br>00:40:20,960 –&gt; 00:40:22,960<br>This question is,</p>
<p>690<br>00:40:22,960 –&gt; 00:40:25,960<br>I’m saying that they’re providing some kind of level of persistence.</p>
<p>691<br>00:40:25,960 –&gt; 00:40:27,960<br>Does that mean single-threaded,</p>
<p>692<br>00:40:27,960 –&gt; 00:40:29,960<br>is a bad idea?</p>
<p>693<br>00:40:29,960 –&gt; 00:40:32,960<br>So,</p>
<p>694<br>00:40:32,960 –&gt; 00:40:34,960<br>not necessarily.</p>
<p>695<br>00:40:34,960 –&gt; 00:40:38,960<br>So if you’re only getting like a single key at a time,</p>
<p>696<br>00:40:38,960 –&gt; 00:40:42,960<br>or getting data that’s always going to be within the same partition,</p>
<p>697<br>00:40:42,960 –&gt; 00:40:44,960<br>then what you could do with Redis,</p>
<p>698<br>00:40:44,960 –&gt; 00:40:46,960<br>and other systems do this single approach,</p>
<p>699<br>00:40:46,960 –&gt; 00:40:49,960<br>like my PC thesis was on this approach,</p>
<p>700<br>00:40:49,960 –&gt; 00:40:52,960<br>you could have every core,</p>
<p>701<br>00:40:52,960 –&gt; 00:40:54,960<br>just run a whole instance of the database server,</p>
<p>702<br>00:40:54,960 –&gt; 00:40:56,960<br>and they don’t need to talk to each other,</p>
<p>703<br>00:40:56,960 –&gt; 00:40:58,960<br>because everything’s going to be within that single system,</p>
<p>704<br>00:40:58,960 –&gt; 00:41:00,960<br>and a single thread it.</p>
<p>705<br>00:41:00,960 –&gt; 00:41:02,960<br>So then now, something above this is decided,</p>
<p>706<br>00:41:02,960 –&gt; 00:41:03,960<br>okay, I need to get this data,</p>
<p>707<br>00:41:03,960 –&gt; 00:41:06,960<br>you could hash it in the side which core you want to then talk to.</p>
<p>708<br>00:41:06,960 –&gt; 00:41:08,960<br>So you could scale out Redis,</p>
<p>709<br>00:41:08,960 –&gt; 00:41:11,960<br>because the transactions don’t need to talk to each other,</p>
<p>710<br>00:41:11,960 –&gt; 00:41:12,960<br>don’t need to talk to different partitions,</p>
<p>711<br>00:41:12,960 –&gt; 00:41:14,960<br>you can scale this out very easily.</p>
<p>712<br>00:41:14,960 –&gt; 00:41:16,960<br>But something above it needs to handle it,</p>
<p>713<br>00:41:16,960 –&gt; 00:41:17,960<br>and I think the Redis,</p>
<p>714<br>00:41:17,960 –&gt; 00:41:18,960<br>the commercial company,</p>
<p>715<br>00:41:18,960 –&gt; 00:41:20,960<br>has something that does that.</p>
<p>716<br>00:41:20,960 –&gt; 00:41:23,960<br>It’s when you have to start talking to,</p>
<p>717<br>00:41:23,960 –&gt; 00:41:25,960<br>if you want an intersectional,</p>
<p>718<br>00:41:25,960 –&gt; 00:41:27,960<br>I get an intersection in a system manner,</p>
<p>719<br>00:41:27,960 –&gt; 00:41:29,960<br>I need to get data to two partitions,</p>
<p>720<br>00:41:29,960 –&gt; 00:41:31,960<br>then that’s where things become problematic,</p>
<p>721<br>00:41:31,960 –&gt; 00:41:33,960<br>because then it’s a distribution of transactions,</p>
<p>722<br>00:41:33,960 –&gt; 00:41:35,960<br>like we talked about before,</p>
<p>723<br>00:41:35,960 –&gt; 00:41:39,960<br>because you got a coordinate across each instance.</p>
<p>724<br>00:41:39,960 –&gt; 00:41:41,960<br>All right, so,</p>
<p>725<br>00:41:41,960 –&gt; 00:41:42,960<br>if it’s in memory,</p>
<p>726<br>00:41:42,960 –&gt; 00:41:45,960<br>in my demo here,</p>
<p>727<br>00:41:45,960 –&gt; 00:41:47,960<br>if I shut the system off, turn it back on,</p>
<p>728<br>00:41:47,960 –&gt; 00:41:49,960<br>it gets wiped out every single time,</p>
<p>729<br>00:41:49,960 –&gt; 00:41:51,960<br>because everything is in memory.</p>
<p>730<br>00:41:51,960 –&gt; 00:41:54,960<br>The thing that makes things</p>
<p>731<br>00:41:54,960 –&gt; 00:41:55,960<br>that are persistent and durable,</p>
<p>732<br>00:41:55,960 –&gt; 00:41:57,960<br>is that they use a right-of-hand log</p>
<p>733<br>00:41:57,960 –&gt; 00:41:59,960<br>for a keep track of individual updates,</p>
<p>734<br>00:41:59,960 –&gt; 00:42:01,960<br>and that literally is writing out the command</p>
<p>735<br>00:42:01,960 –&gt; 00:42:03,960<br>that gets sent over the wire.</p>
<p>736<br>00:42:03,960 –&gt; 00:42:04,960<br>Like, when I type it in the console,</p>
<p>737<br>00:42:04,960 –&gt; 00:42:05,960<br>they literally take that string,</p>
<p>738<br>00:42:05,960 –&gt; 00:42:06,960<br>and they write it to a file.</p>
<p>739<br>00:42:06,960 –&gt; 00:42:08,960<br>It’s logical logging,</p>
<p>740<br>00:42:08,960 –&gt; 00:42:10,960<br>because then when you load back up,</p>
<p>741<br>00:42:10,960 –&gt; 00:42:12,960<br>then they replay the log,</p>
<p>742<br>00:42:12,960 –&gt; 00:42:14,960<br>as if it was coming over the wire.</p>
<p>743<br>00:42:14,960 –&gt; 00:42:15,960<br>But what they do,</p>
<p>744<br>00:42:15,960 –&gt; 00:42:17,960<br>the handle checkpoints or snapshots,</p>
<p>745<br>00:42:17,960 –&gt; 00:42:19,960<br>is that they basically have a background-crong job,</p>
<p>746<br>00:42:19,960 –&gt; 00:42:21,960<br>by default, I think, 60 seconds.</p>
<p>747<br>00:42:21,960 –&gt; 00:42:22,960<br>Every 60 seconds,</p>
<p>748<br>00:42:22,960 –&gt; 00:42:24,960<br>they’re going to fork the process.</p>
<p>749<br>00:42:24,960 –&gt; 00:42:27,960<br>What happens in the OS when you fork the process in memory?</p>
<p>750<br>00:42:27,960 –&gt; 00:42:28,960<br>What’s that?</p>
<p>751<br>00:42:28,960 –&gt; 00:42:30,960<br>Copy-one, right?</p>
<p>752<br>00:42:30,960 –&gt; 00:42:32,960<br>So, you’re going to fork the process,</p>
<p>753<br>00:42:32,960 –&gt; 00:42:34,960<br>and now you have a consistent snapshot</p>
<p>754<br>00:42:34,960 –&gt; 00:42:36,960<br>of what was in memory,</p>
<p>755<br>00:42:36,960 –&gt; 00:42:39,960<br>at the time the process got forked in the child process.</p>
<p>756<br>00:42:39,960 –&gt; 00:42:42,960<br>The parent process can keep processing updates,</p>
<p>757<br>00:42:42,960 –&gt; 00:42:44,960<br>and making modifications to M-memory,</p>
<p>758<br>00:42:44,960 –&gt; 00:42:46,960<br>then the OS does the copy-on-write,</p>
<p>759<br>00:42:46,960 –&gt; 00:42:48,960<br>updates, and makes new pages in memory,</p>
<p>760<br>00:42:48,960 –&gt; 00:42:51,960<br>and so the child process doesn’t see any of those updates.</p>
<p>761<br>00:42:51,960 –&gt; 00:42:53,960<br>And because it’s single-threaded,</p>
<p>762<br>00:42:53,960 –&gt; 00:42:55,960<br>you know that there’s no inflight transactions</p>
<p>763<br>00:42:55,960 –&gt; 00:42:57,960<br>while you’re running,</p>
<p>764<br>00:42:57,960 –&gt; 00:42:59,960<br>so again, it has a consistent view of the database,</p>
<p>765<br>00:42:59,960 –&gt; 00:43:02,960<br>and then that child process just takes whatever’s in memory</p>
<p>766<br>00:43:02,960 –&gt; 00:43:03,960<br>and writes it out the disk,</p>
<p>767<br>00:43:03,960 –&gt; 00:43:04,960<br>as a checkpoint.</p>
<p>768<br>00:43:04,960 –&gt; 00:43:06,960<br>There’s a clever trick to reduce.</p>
<p>769<br>00:43:06,960 –&gt; 00:43:09,960<br>It’s basically stop the world checkpoints,</p>
<p>770<br>00:43:09,960 –&gt; 00:43:11,960<br>but because it’s single-threaded,</p>
<p>771<br>00:43:11,960 –&gt; 00:43:13,960<br>and because you can do this fork,</p>
<p>772<br>00:43:13,960 –&gt; 00:43:16,960<br>there’s very little overhead involved in doing this.</p>
<p>773<br>00:43:16,960 –&gt; 00:43:19,960<br>The pause isn’t very long.</p>
<p>774<br>00:43:19,960 –&gt; 00:43:20,960<br>So that part is very clever,</p>
<p>775<br>00:43:20,960 –&gt; 00:43:23,960<br>and that is the unique to retis.</p>
<p>776<br>00:43:23,960 –&gt; 00:43:25,960<br>For other things, we can get rid of that as a single-threaded.</p>
<p>777<br>00:43:25,960 –&gt; 00:43:27,960<br>It’s a chain hash table.</p>
<p>778<br>00:43:27,960 –&gt; 00:43:29,960<br>There’s no secondary indexes,</p>
<p>779<br>00:43:29,960 –&gt; 00:43:31,960<br>so again, I can only do look-ups on the primary key,</p>
<p>780<br>00:43:31,960 –&gt; 00:43:32,960<br>on the key,</p>
<p>781<br>00:43:32,960 –&gt; 00:43:33,960<br>and there’s no schema,</p>
<p>782<br>00:43:33,960 –&gt; 00:43:34,960<br>there’s no constraints for preventing you</p>
<p>783<br>00:43:34,960 –&gt; 00:43:36,960<br>from putting whatever data you want in.</p>
<p>784<br>00:43:36,960 –&gt; 00:43:37,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>785<br>00:43:37,960 –&gt; 00:43:39,960<br>You know why they chose a chain dash table?</p>
<p>786<br>00:43:39,960 –&gt; 00:43:41,960<br>Flash like, how do you resize it?</p>
<p>787<br>00:43:41,960 –&gt; 00:43:43,960<br>You don’t get like that in a year.</p>
<p>788<br>00:43:43,960 –&gt; 00:43:45,960<br>It’s a question.</p>
<p>789<br>00:43:45,960 –&gt; 00:43:47,960<br>Why do they choose a chain hash table?</p>
<p>790<br>00:43:47,960 –&gt; 00:43:48,960<br>I don’t know.</p>
<p>791<br>00:43:48,960 –&gt; 00:43:50,960<br>Then how do you resize it?</p>
<p>792<br>00:43:50,960 –&gt; 00:43:51,960<br>You don’t.</p>
<p>793<br>00:43:51,960 –&gt; 00:43:54,960<br>You basically say,</p>
<p>794<br>00:43:54,960 –&gt; 00:43:58,960<br>you basically say, you define,</p>
<p>795<br>00:43:58,960 –&gt; 00:44:01,960<br>you allocate the amount of memory you want at the very beginning.</p>
<p>796<br>00:44:01,960 –&gt; 00:44:03,960<br>And then if you run out,</p>
<p>797<br>00:44:03,960 –&gt; 00:44:06,960<br>I mean, I think you’ve got to turn it off and turn it back on.</p>
<p>798<br>00:44:06,960 –&gt; 00:44:08,960<br>But now, for the periodic checkpoints,</p>
<p>799<br>00:44:08,960 –&gt; 00:44:10,960<br>because I think it’s just writing out the contents of memory,</p>
<p>800<br>00:44:10,960 –&gt; 00:44:12,960<br>so it’s literally writing out the data structures of memory,</p>
<p>801<br>00:44:12,960 –&gt; 00:44:14,960<br>I don’t know whether you can resize it</p>
<p>802<br>00:44:14,960 –&gt; 00:44:15,960<br>based on a checkpoint,</p>
<p>803<br>00:44:15,960 –&gt; 00:44:16,960<br>or whether you get the replayed entire,</p>
<p>804<br>00:44:16,960 –&gt; 00:44:18,960<br>right, or a log to repopulate it.</p>
<p>805<br>00:44:21,960 –&gt; 00:44:24,960<br>All right, so they have some notion on transactions.</p>
<p>806<br>00:44:24,960 –&gt; 00:44:28,960<br>But the basically way it works is it’s client-side transactions.</p>
<p>807<br>00:44:28,960 –&gt; 00:44:30,960<br>I don’t know how to do this in the command line.</p>
<p>808<br>00:44:30,960 –&gt; 00:44:31,960<br>We could look it up,</p>
<p>809<br>00:44:31,960 –&gt; 00:44:33,960<br>because it’s not begin commit.</p>
<p>810<br>00:44:33,960 –&gt; 00:44:36,960<br>When you call begin,</p>
<p>811<br>00:44:36,960 –&gt; 00:44:39,960<br>they’re going to begin on the client side.</p>
<p>812<br>00:44:39,960 –&gt; 00:44:42,960<br>Then any operation you apply,</p>
<p>813<br>00:44:42,960 –&gt; 00:44:44,960<br>then it just gets batched.</p>
<p>814<br>00:44:44,960 –&gt; 00:44:45,960<br>And then when you go commit,</p>
<p>815<br>00:44:45,960 –&gt; 00:44:49,960<br>then everything gets sent over the wire to the Davies server.</p>
<p>816<br>00:44:49,960 –&gt; 00:44:51,960<br>And again, because it’s single threaded,</p>
<p>817<br>00:44:51,960 –&gt; 00:44:54,960<br>then it just runs whatever commands you provide it all at once.</p>
<p>818<br>00:44:54,960 –&gt; 00:44:57,960<br>That’s their notion of transactions.</p>
<p>819<br>00:44:57,960 –&gt; 00:45:00,960<br>So the problem, though, is they don’t allow for a rollback.</p>
<p>820<br>00:45:00,960 –&gt; 00:45:04,960<br>So if I send a batch of queries over to do updates,</p>
<p>821<br>00:45:04,960 –&gt; 00:45:06,960<br>and I make a mistake, like I showed before,</p>
<p>822<br>00:45:06,960 –&gt; 00:45:08,960<br>and I update, say I have two records,</p>
<p>823<br>00:45:08,960 –&gt; 00:45:09,960<br>then I make a mistake,</p>
<p>824<br>00:45:09,960 –&gt; 00:45:10,960<br>and the transaction gets aborted,</p>
<p>825<br>00:45:10,960 –&gt; 00:45:13,960<br>and I can’t rollback the previous things that I already did.</p>
<p>826<br>00:45:13,960 –&gt; 00:45:16,960<br>So there’s not true at atomic transactions,</p>
<p>827<br>00:45:16,960 –&gt; 00:45:20,960<br>at least in the open source version.</p>
<p>828<br>00:45:20,960 –&gt; 00:45:21,960<br>For the replication,</p>
<p>829<br>00:45:21,960 –&gt; 00:45:24,960<br>they’re doing asynchronous primary replica replication.</p>
<p>830<br>00:45:24,960 –&gt; 00:45:27,960<br>So the master is just going to send the op-log of the commands</p>
<p>831<br>00:45:27,960 –&gt; 00:45:28,960<br>that came out of the wire,</p>
<p>832<br>00:45:28,960 –&gt; 00:45:30,960<br>do down-street replicas.</p>
<p>833<br>00:45:30,960 –&gt; 00:45:34,960<br>And you can configure it to allow the primary to wait</p>
<p>834<br>00:45:34,960 –&gt; 00:45:37,960<br>until some quorum of the replicas respond</p>
<p>835<br>00:45:37,960 –&gt; 00:45:39,960<br>and they got the requests.</p>
<p>836<br>00:45:39,960 –&gt; 00:45:40,960<br>Not that they actually applied them,</p>
<p>837<br>00:45:40,960 –&gt; 00:45:42,960<br>that they just got the network messages.</p>
<p>838<br>00:45:42,960 –&gt; 00:45:45,960<br>By default, though, I don’t think that’s turned on.</p>
<p>839<br>00:45:45,960 –&gt; 00:45:48,960<br>So it’s like eventually consistent.</p>
<p>840<br>00:45:48,960 –&gt; 00:45:50,960<br>Again, for a cache, that’s probably okay.</p>
<p>841<br>00:45:50,960 –&gt; 00:45:56,960<br>The primary data base, or primary storage, probably a bad idea.</p>
<p>842<br>00:45:56,960 –&gt; 00:45:58,960<br>Okay?</p>
<p>843<br>00:45:58,960 –&gt; 00:46:00,960<br>So one thing I hope you get out of this,</p>
<p>844<br>00:46:00,960 –&gt; 00:46:02,960<br>going with these systems very quickly,</p>
<p>845<br>00:46:02,960 –&gt; 00:46:04,960<br>is that there’s a bunch of these buzzwords I’m using</p>
<p>846<br>00:46:04,960 –&gt; 00:46:05,960<br>that we’ve covered throughout the semester.</p>
<p>847<br>00:46:05,960 –&gt; 00:46:07,960<br>You see now how you can look at any system</p>
<p>848<br>00:46:08,960 –&gt; 00:46:10,960<br>and apply the concepts and methods and things</p>
<p>849<br>00:46:10,960 –&gt; 00:46:12,960<br>we talked about throughout the entire semester,</p>
<p>850<br>00:46:12,960 –&gt; 00:46:14,960<br>and say, okay, now I understand what the systems actually do</p>
<p>851<br>00:46:14,960 –&gt; 00:46:16,960<br>and when they say they’re this or they’re doing that.</p>
<p>852<br>00:46:16,960 –&gt; 00:46:21,960<br>And what would it pose the cons of all of them?</p>
<p>853<br>00:46:21,960 –&gt; 00:46:26,960<br>All right, so the next one that was the most was cucklers DB.</p>
<p>854<br>00:46:26,960 –&gt; 00:46:29,960<br>So cuckler DB came out in 2015.</p>
<p>855<br>00:46:29,960 –&gt; 00:46:32,960<br>It was less so recently,</p>
<p>856<br>00:46:32,960 –&gt; 00:46:34,960<br>but initially when it first came out,</p>
<p>857<br>00:46:34,960 –&gt; 00:46:36,960<br>it was sort of incorrectly described</p>
<p>858<br>00:46:36,960 –&gt; 00:46:38,960<br>as the open source version of Google Spanner,</p>
<p>859<br>00:46:38,960 –&gt; 00:46:41,960<br>because the co-founders worked at Google</p>
<p>860<br>00:46:41,960 –&gt; 00:46:43,960<br>before they started cucklers DB,</p>
<p>861<br>00:46:43,960 –&gt; 00:46:45,960<br>but they didn’t work on Spanner.</p>
<p>862<br>00:46:45,960 –&gt; 00:46:47,960<br>They just said, let’s go a bit of distributed data system.</p>
<p>863<br>00:46:47,960 –&gt; 00:46:50,960<br>So it’s a distributed relational data system that’s written and go,</p>
<p>864<br>00:46:50,960 –&gt; 00:46:54,960<br>and it’s going to be a decentralized homogenous shared nothing architecture</p>
<p>865<br>00:46:54,960 –&gt; 00:46:57,960<br>that’s going to use rain partition to split the data</p>
<p>866<br>00:46:57,960 –&gt; 00:46:59,960<br>across different nodes.</p>
<p>867<br>00:46:59,960 –&gt; 00:47:02,960<br>So it’s going to be, they can be post-cress compatible,</p>
<p>868<br>00:47:02,960 –&gt; 00:47:05,960<br>but for the SQL dialect and for the wire protocol</p>
<p>869<br>00:47:05,960 –&gt; 00:47:07,960<br>and the catalog, meaning like in theory,</p>
<p>870<br>00:47:07,960 –&gt; 00:47:10,960<br>if I have my application written for post-cress using post-cress,</p>
<p>871<br>00:47:10,960 –&gt; 00:47:12,960<br>you know, SQL syntax and so forth,</p>
<p>872<br>00:47:12,960 –&gt; 00:47:15,960<br>and post-cress, you know, client drivers,</p>
<p>873<br>00:47:15,960 –&gt; 00:47:17,960<br>I could just point at that cuckler should everything will work.</p>
<p>874<br>00:47:17,960 –&gt; 00:47:20,960<br>Not entirely true, some things will be different,</p>
<p>875<br>00:47:20,960 –&gt; 00:47:21,960<br>semantics or certain things will be different</p>
<p>876<br>00:47:21,960 –&gt; 00:47:23,960<br>because cuckler DB is distributed.</p>
<p>877<br>00:47:23,960 –&gt; 00:47:27,960<br>And certainly there’s new features to come out in post-cress</p>
<p>878<br>00:47:27,960 –&gt; 00:47:29,960<br>that just came out,</p>
<p>879<br>00:47:29,960 –&gt; 00:47:32,960<br>the cuckler’s pie wouldn’t support that.</p>
<p>880<br>00:47:32,960 –&gt; 00:47:34,960<br>So we haven’t really talked about licensing models this semester,</p>
<p>881<br>00:47:34,960 –&gt; 00:47:39,960<br>but it’s interesting to point out that cuckler’s DB is open source,</p>
<p>882<br>00:47:39,960 –&gt; 00:47:43,960<br>but they use what is called the BSL, the business source license.</p>
<p>883<br>00:47:43,960 –&gt; 00:47:49,960<br>And this is sort of a trend that lasts five, six, seven,</p>
<p>884<br>00:47:49,960 –&gt; 00:47:51,960<br>eight years in databases, in particular,</p>
<p>885<br>00:47:51,960 –&gt; 00:47:53,960<br>probably in other open source projects,</p>
<p>886<br>00:47:53,960 –&gt; 00:47:56,960<br>but definitely in databases where it is open source,</p>
<p>887<br>00:47:56,960 –&gt; 00:48:00,960<br>but the idea is that if you’re just like, you know,</p>
<p>888<br>00:48:00,960 –&gt; 00:48:02,960<br>research, researchers like us,</p>
<p>889<br>00:48:02,960 –&gt; 00:48:04,960<br>or just like, you know, building a hobby project,</p>
<p>890<br>00:48:04,960 –&gt; 00:48:06,960<br>or just want to use it for your, you know,</p>
<p>891<br>00:48:06,960 –&gt; 00:48:07,960<br>for whatever your application is,</p>
<p>892<br>00:48:07,960 –&gt; 00:48:09,960<br>you can just download the software and you can just use it.</p>
<p>893<br>00:48:09,960 –&gt; 00:48:11,960<br>The BSL, so it’s open source,</p>
<p>894<br>00:48:11,960 –&gt; 00:48:14,960<br>but it prevents you from being a cloud vendor</p>
<p>895<br>00:48:14,960 –&gt; 00:48:16,960<br>and taking their software and then selling it as a service,</p>
<p>896<br>00:48:16,960 –&gt; 00:48:20,960<br>like an Amazon, like a Google, like a Microsoft.</p>
<p>897<br>00:48:20,960 –&gt; 00:48:23,960<br>And as a bunch of systems have changed their licensing model</p>
<p>898<br>00:48:23,960 –&gt; 00:48:25,960<br>to switch to something like the BSL,</p>
<p>899<br>00:48:25,960 –&gt; 00:48:27,960<br>Mongo has something similar,</p>
<p>900<br>00:48:27,960 –&gt; 00:48:29,960<br>a elastic switch to something similar.</p>
<p>901<br>00:48:29,960 –&gt; 00:48:31,960<br>And again, basically, there’s a bunch of these open source projects</p>
<p>902<br>00:48:31,960 –&gt; 00:48:36,960<br>where Amazon was making more money selling their data system</p>
<p>903<br>00:48:36,960 –&gt; 00:48:40,960<br>than the actual people building the data system.</p>
<p>904<br>00:48:40,960 –&gt; 00:48:44,960<br>And so they switched this licensing model to prevent that.</p>
<p>905<br>00:48:44,960 –&gt; 00:48:46,960<br>It hasn’t been challenged in court,</p>
<p>906<br>00:48:46,960 –&gt; 00:48:48,960<br>but there’s been enough,</p>
<p>907<br>00:48:48,960 –&gt; 00:48:52,960<br>it’s enough to scare away some cloud vendors from doing certain things.</p>
<p>908<br>00:48:52,960 –&gt; 00:48:55,960<br>Mongo has had dust-ups with Amazon,</p>
<p>909<br>00:48:55,960 –&gt; 00:48:58,960<br>elastic search had dust-ups with Amazon,</p>
<p>910<br>00:48:59,960 –&gt; 00:49:02,960<br>so Amazon forked it and things called open search now.</p>
<p>911<br>00:49:02,960 –&gt; 00:49:04,960<br>Everyone’s trying to avoid getting taken over,</p>
<p>912<br>00:49:04,960 –&gt; 00:49:07,960<br>eating a lie by the cloud vendors.</p>
<p>913<br>00:49:07,960 –&gt; 00:49:09,960<br>So, Cochishy B, on every single note,</p>
<p>914<br>00:49:09,960 –&gt; 00:49:10,960<br>even though it’s distributed,</p>
<p>915<br>00:49:10,960 –&gt; 00:49:12,960<br>it’s going to be log-truck your storage.</p>
<p>916<br>00:49:12,960 –&gt; 00:49:14,960<br>Let’s talk about that in a second.</p>
<p>917<br>00:49:14,960 –&gt; 00:49:16,960<br>The query engine is going to be a pool-based,</p>
<p>918<br>00:49:16,960 –&gt; 00:49:19,960<br>a pool-based, vectorized processing model.</p>
<p>919<br>00:49:19,960 –&gt; 00:49:22,960<br>So you even know it was originally designed for OOTP.</p>
<p>920<br>00:49:22,960 –&gt; 00:49:24,960<br>They switched to a vectorized model a few years ago</p>
<p>921<br>00:49:24,960 –&gt; 00:49:27,960<br>because they want to support also analytics on the system.</p>
<p>922<br>00:49:27,960 –&gt; 00:49:30,960<br>And they’re going to do MVGC, OCC,</p>
<p>923<br>00:49:30,960 –&gt; 00:49:32,960<br>and what’s interesting is that all the transactions,</p>
<p>924<br>00:49:32,960 –&gt; 00:49:33,960<br>even distributed transactions,</p>
<p>925<br>00:49:33,960 –&gt; 00:49:36,960<br>will run with a serializable isolation level.</p>
<p>926<br>00:49:36,960 –&gt; 00:49:38,960<br>Like if you call, like, I want to run read and committed</p>
<p>927<br>00:49:38,960 –&gt; 00:49:39,960<br>or recommitted,</p>
<p>928<br>00:49:39,960 –&gt; 00:49:43,960<br>that’s just an alias for serializable.</p>
<p>929<br>00:49:43,960 –&gt; 00:49:46,960<br>They don’t run anything lower than that,</p>
<p>930<br>00:49:46,960 –&gt; 00:49:48,960<br>which is really interesting.</p>
<p>931<br>00:49:49,960 –&gt; 00:49:51,960<br>So the way they want Cochishy’s architecture,</p>
<p>932<br>00:49:51,960 –&gt; 00:49:54,960<br>it’s the multilayer stuff that we’ve been seeing before,</p>
<p>933<br>00:49:54,960 –&gt; 00:49:58,960<br>but at its core, it’s just a replicated key value store.</p>
<p>934<br>00:49:58,960 –&gt; 00:50:01,960<br>And that there’s this infrastructure on top of the database system,</p>
<p>935<br>00:50:01,960 –&gt; 00:50:03,960<br>or on top of the key value store,</p>
<p>936<br>00:50:03,960 –&gt; 00:50:05,960<br>that understands SQL, understands partitioning schemes,</p>
<p>937<br>00:50:05,960 –&gt; 00:50:07,960<br>understands transactions and so forth.</p>
<p>938<br>00:50:07,960 –&gt; 00:50:10,960<br>And so they’re basically, you can think of the storage layer,</p>
<p>939<br>00:50:10,960 –&gt; 00:50:14,960<br>it’s just a giant sort of map in the key value store,</p>
<p>940<br>00:50:14,960 –&gt; 00:50:16,960<br>and then the upper layers are trying to figure out,</p>
<p>941<br>00:50:16,960 –&gt; 00:50:18,960<br>okay, for this query, you need data from here</p>
<p>942<br>00:50:18,960 –&gt; 00:50:20,960<br>and go up here and so forth, right?</p>
<p>943<br>00:50:20,960 –&gt; 00:50:22,960<br>So when Cochishy B first came out,</p>
<p>944<br>00:50:22,960 –&gt; 00:50:27,960<br>they were using RoxyB, which is Facebook’s log structure</p>
<p>945<br>00:50:27,960 –&gt; 00:50:29,960<br>to key value store, like this single note</p>
<p>946<br>00:50:29,960 –&gt; 00:50:31,960<br>embedded database system.</p>
<p>947<br>00:50:31,960 –&gt; 00:50:34,960<br>And then I remember they were telling me a few years ago</p>
<p>948<br>00:50:34,960 –&gt; 00:50:36,960<br>when I went to go visit them, that the overhead</p>
<p>949<br>00:50:36,960 –&gt; 00:50:40,960<br>of going from go into SQL Sustained for RoxyB</p>
<p>950<br>00:50:40,960 –&gt; 00:50:42,960<br>was, the overhead was quite high.</p>
<p>951<br>00:50:42,960 –&gt; 00:50:44,960<br>So a few years ago, they threw RoxyB away</p>
<p>952<br>00:50:44,960 –&gt; 00:50:49,960<br>and they wrote their own clone of RoxyB in Go called Pebble.</p>
<p>953<br>00:50:50,960 –&gt; 00:50:54,960<br>And that way, the whole stack is now entirely written in Go.</p>
<p>954<br>00:50:55,960 –&gt; 00:50:57,960<br>And that’s the logo for Pebble that I made,</p>
<p>955<br>00:50:57,960 –&gt; 00:50:59,960<br>because they didn’t have one so I sent it to them,</p>
<p>956<br>00:50:59,960 –&gt; 00:51:01,960<br>because I had to put something.</p>
<p>957<br>00:51:02,960 –&gt; 00:51:05,960<br>Anyway, and to do transactions,</p>
<p>958<br>00:51:05,960 –&gt; 00:51:06,960<br>they’re not going to use two-base commit,</p>
<p>959<br>00:51:06,960 –&gt; 00:51:09,960<br>they’re not going to use Paxos, they’re going to use Rafft,</p>
<p>960<br>00:51:09,960 –&gt; 00:51:12,960<br>which again, it’s just a variant of Paxos</p>
<p>961<br>00:51:12,960 –&gt; 00:51:14,960<br>that we talked about last time.</p>
<p>962<br>00:51:16,960 –&gt; 00:51:18,960<br>So the way they’re going to order transactions is interesting.</p>
<p>963<br>00:51:19,960 –&gt; 00:51:21,960<br>So they’re going to use what are called hybrid clocks,</p>
<p>964<br>00:51:21,960 –&gt; 00:51:23,960<br>which I think we talked about a little bit earlier</p>
<p>965<br>00:51:23,960 –&gt; 00:51:26,960<br>in the semester, where, because now,</p>
<p>966<br>00:51:26,960 –&gt; 00:51:28,960<br>they want to run transactions across nodes</p>
<p>967<br>00:51:28,960 –&gt; 00:51:31,960<br>that could be in different locations around the world</p>
<p>968<br>00:51:31,960 –&gt; 00:51:33,960<br>in the data center, you can’t guarantee</p>
<p>969<br>00:51:33,960 –&gt; 00:51:36,960<br>that their times are all going to be tightly synchronized.</p>
<p>970<br>00:51:36,960 –&gt; 00:51:40,960<br>And so the transactions are going to get timestamps</p>
<p>971<br>00:51:40,960 –&gt; 00:51:43,960<br>using a combination of the wall clock time</p>
<p>972<br>00:51:43,960 –&gt; 00:51:45,960<br>and you get from the server you’re running on,</p>
<p>973<br>00:51:46,960 –&gt; 00:51:48,960<br>and then a logical counter,</p>
<p>974<br>00:51:48,960 –&gt; 00:51:51,960<br>and like a host ID to break ties.</p>
<p>975<br>00:51:52,960 –&gt; 00:51:56,960<br>And that’s enough to make every transaction globally unique</p>
<p>976<br>00:51:56,960 –&gt; 00:52:00,960<br>and also determine the order in which transactions should commit.</p>
<p>977<br>00:52:01,960 –&gt; 00:52:04,960<br>So the local clocks are still being synchronized using NTP,</p>
<p>978<br>00:52:04,960 –&gt; 00:52:06,960<br>but it’s not going to be super precise.</p>
<p>979<br>00:52:06,960 –&gt; 00:52:07,960<br>Like when we talked about Spanner,</p>
<p>980<br>00:52:07,960 –&gt; 00:52:11,960<br>they were using GPS satellite receivers and atomic clocks,</p>
<p>981<br>00:52:11,960 –&gt; 00:52:14,960<br>and that guarantee their times would be within some bounds</p>
<p>982<br>00:52:15,960 –&gt; 00:52:17,960<br>of being of a synchronized across the world.</p>
<p>983<br>00:52:17,960 –&gt; 00:52:19,960<br>But in this, in cockroach TV,</p>
<p>984<br>00:52:19,960 –&gt; 00:52:21,960<br>since they can’t run that proprietary hardware,</p>
<p>985<br>00:52:21,960 –&gt; 00:52:24,960<br>they rely on the wall clocks being loosely synchronized,</p>
<p>986<br>00:52:24,960 –&gt; 00:52:27,960<br>and that’s just good enough for them to,</p>
<p>987<br>00:52:27,960 –&gt; 00:52:32,960<br>to at least coordinate without massive delays.</p>
<p>988<br>00:52:33,960 –&gt; 00:52:35,960<br>Of course, now, if you have some node where like the clocks</p>
<p>989<br>00:52:35,960 –&gt; 00:52:36,960<br>way off by like an hour,</p>
<p>990<br>00:52:36,960 –&gt; 00:52:37,960<br>then every transaction is going to fail,</p>
<p>991<br>00:52:37,960 –&gt; 00:52:42,960<br>because those transactions are going to be way back in the past,</p>
<p>992<br>00:52:42,960 –&gt; 00:52:43,960<br>and that will break things.</p>
<p>993<br>00:52:43,960 –&gt; 00:52:45,960<br>And therefore, you manually intervene to kill that node,</p>
<p>994<br>00:52:45,960 –&gt; 00:52:47,960<br>but that’s beside the point.</p>
<p>995<br>00:52:48,960 –&gt; 00:52:50,960<br>So for OCC, the way they’re going to do is</p>
<p>996<br>00:52:50,960 –&gt; 00:52:52,960<br>that the transaction is going to stage all the rights as intense,</p>
<p>997<br>00:52:52,960 –&gt; 00:52:54,960<br>and then when they go commit, then they go,</p>
<p>998<br>00:52:54,960 –&gt; 00:52:56,960<br>that’s when they go check to see whether</p>
<p>999<br>00:52:56,960 –&gt; 00:52:59,960<br>you pass the validation phase to allow the store to stop.</p>
<p>1000<br>00:52:59,960 –&gt; 00:53:02,960<br>And then all the metadata about where the transaction state</p>
<p>1001<br>00:53:02,960 –&gt; 00:53:06,960<br>and the partition scheme or the catalog of the data to self,</p>
<p>1002<br>00:53:06,960 –&gt; 00:53:10,960<br>that’s just also stored it as a table in the key value store.</p>
<p>1003<br>00:53:11,960 –&gt; 00:53:15,960<br>And that’s replicated and you do transactions on top of that.</p>
<p>1004<br>00:53:17,960 –&gt; 00:53:19,960<br>So here’s the basic overview of how a transaction will work.</p>
<p>1005<br>00:53:19,960 –&gt; 00:53:21,960<br>Again, so you have some kind of catalog that keeps track</p>
<p>1006<br>00:53:21,960 –&gt; 00:53:23,960<br>of the partition scheme of the database,</p>
<p>1007<br>00:53:23,960 –&gt; 00:53:26,960<br>and I think by default, in Cochris DB,</p>
<p>1008<br>00:53:26,960 –&gt; 00:53:28,960<br>everything’s always range partitioned.</p>
<p>1009<br>00:53:28,960 –&gt; 00:53:31,960<br>And so this state catalog, we replicate it across all the nodes.</p>
<p>1010<br>00:53:32,960 –&gt; 00:53:34,960<br>So if I want to do an update,</p>
<p>1011<br>00:53:34,960 –&gt; 00:53:37,960<br>say a simple case where I’m updating on the primary key,</p>
<p>1012<br>00:53:38,960 –&gt; 00:53:43,960<br>I go check the catalog to say where can I find this partition?</p>
<p>1013<br>00:53:44,960 –&gt; 00:53:47,960<br>And then I’ll figure out which one is the leader,</p>
<p>1014<br>00:53:47,960 –&gt; 00:53:50,960<br>and he’s run leader election for that partition whenever you need to,</p>
<p>1015<br>00:53:50,960 –&gt; 00:53:52,960<br>determine who’s the leader.</p>
<p>1016<br>00:53:52,960 –&gt; 00:53:55,960<br>And then all the rights will go to this node, the leader,</p>
<p>1017<br>00:53:55,960 –&gt; 00:53:57,960<br>and then it’s responsible for them propagating the updates</p>
<p>1018<br>00:53:57,960 –&gt; 00:54:01,960<br>to the other partitions or other nodes that have the replicated copies</p>
<p>1019<br>00:54:01,960 –&gt; 00:54:04,960<br>of that partition using RAPT,</p>
<p>1020<br>00:54:04,960 –&gt; 00:54:07,960<br>and then get everyone to agree that this changed a lot to happen,</p>
<p>1021<br>00:54:07,960 –&gt; 00:54:09,960<br>and then you go ahead and commit.</p>
<p>1022<br>00:54:10,960 –&gt; 00:54:14,960<br>When you do a read, by default,</p>
<p>1023<br>00:54:14,960 –&gt; 00:54:17,960<br>you would always want to go read from the leader,</p>
<p>1024<br>00:54:17,960 –&gt; 00:54:21,960<br>because again, they only run with serialized isolation level,</p>
<p>1025<br>00:54:21,960 –&gt; 00:54:24,960<br>so you can’t do by default still reads.</p>
<p>1026<br>00:54:24,960 –&gt; 00:54:26,960<br>So you can guarantee, if you always go to the leader,</p>
<p>1027<br>00:54:26,960 –&gt; 00:54:28,960<br>that you always see the latest version of any object</p>
<p>1028<br>00:54:28,960 –&gt; 00:54:29,960<br>that you’re looking for.</p>
<p>1029<br>00:54:29,960 –&gt; 00:54:32,960<br>So you’ll be directed to go do reads here.</p>
<p>1030<br>00:54:33,960 –&gt; 00:54:35,960<br>And obviously when we talked about primary RAPT,</p>
<p>1031<br>00:54:35,960 –&gt; 00:54:37,960<br>like replication versus multi-home,</p>
<p>1032<br>00:54:37,960 –&gt; 00:54:40,960<br>this was, if all your rights are going to the leader,</p>
<p>1033<br>00:54:40,960 –&gt; 00:54:42,960<br>and all your reads are going to the leader,</p>
<p>1034<br>00:54:42,960 –&gt; 00:54:46,960<br>the leader can become a bottleneck and slow things down.</p>
<p>1035<br>00:54:46,960 –&gt; 00:54:50,960<br>So I don’t think they don’t let you set the isolation level</p>
<p>1036<br>00:54:50,960 –&gt; 00:54:52,960<br>to go read from other nodes.</p>
<p>1037<br>00:54:52,960 –&gt; 00:54:55,960<br>You actually have to modify the SQL syntax to introduce the,</p>
<p>1038<br>00:54:55,960 –&gt; 00:54:58,960<br>or give a hint to the database system that you’re okay</p>
<p>1039<br>00:54:58,960 –&gt; 00:55:01,960<br>with reading STALE data on the replicas.</p>
<p>1040<br>00:55:01,960 –&gt; 00:55:03,960<br>So in this case here, you change the select query to say,</p>
<p>1041<br>00:55:03,960 –&gt; 00:55:07,960<br>select from table XXX, as a system time within the max STALE,</p>
<p>1042<br>00:55:07,960 –&gt; 00:55:09,960<br>STALE in a sub 10 seconds.</p>
<p>1043<br>00:55:09,960 –&gt; 00:55:12,960<br>So this men allow the data inside, okay,</p>
<p>1044<br>00:55:12,960 –&gt; 00:55:15,960<br>if this node is at least 10 seconds in sync with the leader,</p>
<p>1045<br>00:55:15,960 –&gt; 00:55:19,960<br>I can then read any data from that.</p>
<p>1046<br>00:55:19,960 –&gt; 00:55:21,960<br>So although CockersDB is open source,</p>
<p>1047<br>00:55:21,960 –&gt; 00:55:23,960<br>I think for this feature, it’s only available in like,</p>
<p>1048<br>00:55:23,960 –&gt; 00:55:27,960<br>the enterprise commercial version.</p>
<p>1049<br>00:55:28,960 –&gt; 00:55:30,960<br>So again, CockersDB,</p>
<p>1050<br>00:55:30,960 –&gt; 00:55:32,960<br>decentralized, homogeneous,</p>
<p>1051<br>00:55:32,960 –&gt; 00:55:36,960<br>shared nothing distributed database system that’s using raft</p>
<p>1052<br>00:55:36,960 –&gt; 00:55:38,960<br>to do transactions across different nodes,</p>
<p>1053<br>00:55:38,960 –&gt; 00:55:41,960<br>and they’re doing multi-versioning on top of that.</p>
<p>1054<br>00:55:44,960 –&gt; 00:55:46,960<br>All right, next one, snowflake.</p>
<p>1055<br>00:55:46,960 –&gt; 00:55:50,960<br>So if you take 721, we’re going to spend a lot of time talking about snowflake.</p>
<p>1056<br>00:55:50,960 –&gt; 00:55:53,960<br>So it’s one of the first cloud native,</p>
<p>1057<br>00:55:54,960 –&gt; 00:55:55,960<br>OLA updated the systems.</p>
<p>1058<br>00:55:55,960 –&gt; 00:55:57,960<br>Everything’s written in C++.</p>
<p>1059<br>00:55:57,960 –&gt; 00:56:01,960<br>It’s one of the first systems that did a shared disk architecture,</p>
<p>1060<br>00:56:01,960 –&gt; 00:56:03,960<br>at least with a cloud.</p>
<p>1061<br>00:56:03,960 –&gt; 00:56:07,960<br>The query engine itself is going to be a push-based vectorized query processing engine.</p>
<p>1062<br>00:56:07,960 –&gt; 00:56:10,960<br>And this is what actually made snowflake different than a bunch of other systems</p>
<p>1063<br>00:56:10,960 –&gt; 00:56:14,960<br>that sort of, we’re trying to analyze at that time.</p>
<p>1064<br>00:56:14,960 –&gt; 00:56:17,960<br>In fact, they leverage very heavily on using SIMD</p>
<p>1065<br>00:56:17,960 –&gt; 00:56:19,960<br>or vectorizing structures on the CPU,</p>
<p>1066<br>00:56:19,960 –&gt; 00:56:22,960<br>the process things in parallel within operators.</p>
<p>1067<br>00:56:24,960 –&gt; 00:56:30,960<br>To avoid the overhead of trying to interpret bytes or the types of columns and data</p>
<p>1068<br>00:56:30,960 –&gt; 00:56:34,960<br>at runtime and having a bunch of indirection in the code,</p>
<p>1069<br>00:56:34,960 –&gt; 00:56:36,960<br>like a giant switch statement says,</p>
<p>1070<br>00:56:36,960 –&gt; 00:56:38,960<br>if I’m adding two numbers together or two values together,</p>
<p>1071<br>00:56:38,960 –&gt; 00:56:40,960<br>if this integer do this, if the float do that,</p>
<p>1072<br>00:56:40,960 –&gt; 00:56:44,960<br>they want to avoid all that indirection because it’s not great for modern CPUs.</p>
<p>1073<br>00:56:44,960 –&gt; 00:56:49,960<br>So what they do is they pre-compile all these low-level primitive operations</p>
<p>1074<br>00:56:49,960 –&gt; 00:56:51,960<br>for different data types.</p>
<p>1075<br>00:56:52,960 –&gt; 00:56:55,960<br>So if I want to add two types together,</p>
<p>1076<br>00:56:55,960 –&gt; 00:57:00,960<br>or I want to check maybe whether a value is greater than another value.</p>
<p>1077<br>00:57:00,960 –&gt; 00:57:03,960<br>So I would have different copies of that same function,</p>
<p>1078<br>00:57:03,960 –&gt; 00:57:08,960<br>but one for floats, one for integers, one for strings, one for dates, and so forth.</p>
<p>1079<br>00:57:08,960 –&gt; 00:57:14,960<br>And you pre-compile them when you’re actually making the build for the system.</p>
<p>1080<br>00:57:14,960 –&gt; 00:57:17,960<br>And then at runtime, you go figure out, because you have a catalog,</p>
<p>1081<br>00:57:17,960 –&gt; 00:57:18,960<br>you can look in the schema and say,</p>
<p>1082<br>00:57:18,960 –&gt; 00:57:20,960<br>oh, I know I’m going to operate in a column with this type.</p>
<p>1083<br>00:57:20,960 –&gt; 00:57:24,960<br>Then you go pick the primitive out that knows how to operate on 32-bit integers</p>
<p>1084<br>00:57:24,960 –&gt; 00:57:26,960<br>or 64-bit integers and so forth.</p>
<p>1085<br>00:57:28,960 –&gt; 00:57:29,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1086<br>00:57:29,960 –&gt; 00:57:32,960<br>Is this being like, if I did a flip-flop template?</p>
<p>1087<br>00:57:32,960 –&gt; 00:57:34,960<br>Sqs, would this be able to see the list template? Yes.</p>
<p>1088<br>00:57:37,960 –&gt; 00:57:38,960<br>In bust-top, we don’t do that.</p>
<p>1089<br>00:57:38,960 –&gt; 00:57:42,960<br>In bust-top, if you look at the value code for the value types,</p>
<p>1090<br>00:57:42,960 –&gt; 00:57:44,960<br>there’s a switch statement.</p>
<p>1091<br>00:57:44,960 –&gt; 00:57:45,960<br>And that’s how most systems do it.</p>
<p>1092<br>00:57:45,960 –&gt; 00:57:47,960<br>Post-crested others, my SQL does a lot of stuff to do this.</p>
<p>1093<br>00:57:49,960 –&gt; 00:57:52,960<br>But again, I’m going to read a billion two-poles, and the type is always going to be the same.</p>
<p>1094<br>00:57:52,960 –&gt; 00:57:54,960<br>I don’t want to do that switch statement over and over again.</p>
<p>1095<br>00:57:54,960 –&gt; 00:57:55,960<br>It’s a waste.</p>
<p>1096<br>00:57:55,960 –&gt; 00:57:57,960<br>What’s the other thing you have the same code?</p>
<p>1097<br>00:57:57,960 –&gt; 00:57:58,960<br>You’re going to be writing the same code, right?</p>
<p>1098<br>00:57:58,960 –&gt; 00:57:59,960<br>You have a switch statement.</p>
<p>1099<br>00:57:59,960 –&gt; 00:58:00,960<br>You have all these different versions of what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>1100<br>00:58:00,960 –&gt; 00:58:03,960<br>Like, there’s a save you much to do with a switch statement.</p>
<p>1101<br>00:58:03,960 –&gt; 00:58:08,960<br>There’s a save you much to do over a switch statement.</p>
<p>1102<br>00:58:10,960 –&gt; 00:58:14,960<br>But like, think of like, it’s more like the dispatch code.</p>
<p>1103<br>00:58:14,960 –&gt; 00:58:16,960<br>So you give it to the switch statement, and you literally say,</p>
<p>1104<br>00:58:16,960 –&gt; 00:58:19,960<br>here’s the pointer to the function that does 32-bit integer comparisons.</p>
<p>1105<br>00:58:19,960 –&gt; 00:58:22,960<br>Then at runtime, when you generate the query plan,</p>
<p>1106<br>00:58:22,960 –&gt; 00:58:25,960<br>you literally put in the point, you call that pointer,</p>
<p>1107<br>00:58:25,960 –&gt; 00:58:27,960<br>instead of calling the function that has a switch statement,</p>
<p>1108<br>00:58:27,960 –&gt; 00:58:29,960<br>the man calls that for you.</p>
<p>1109<br>00:58:29,960 –&gt; 00:58:31,960<br>It’s like a software engineering thing.</p>
<p>1110<br>00:58:31,960 –&gt; 00:58:33,960<br>Do you say much time doing switch statement?</p>
<p>1111<br>00:58:33,960 –&gt; 00:58:36,960<br>You’re writing all the same things that you did in the last time.</p>
<p>1112<br>00:58:36,960 –&gt; 00:58:38,960<br>Do you say much time, sorry, what?</p>
<p>1113<br>00:58:38,960 –&gt; 00:58:40,960<br>You’re using switch statements instead of time, but…</p>
<p>1114<br>00:58:40,960 –&gt; 00:58:43,960<br>No, you want to get rid of the switch statement. Yes.</p>
<p>1115<br>00:58:43,960 –&gt; 00:58:46,960<br>I guess I’m asking why would you not do this?</p>
<p>1116<br>00:58:46,960 –&gt; 00:58:48,960<br>Because there’s a software engineering overhead.</p>
<p>1117<br>00:58:48,960 –&gt; 00:58:50,960<br>You have to design your system for this.</p>
<p>1118<br>00:58:50,960 –&gt; 00:58:51,960<br>To do this.</p>
<p>1119<br>00:58:51,960 –&gt; 00:58:53,960<br>And prior to…</p>
<p>1120<br>00:58:53,960 –&gt; 00:58:54,960<br>There’s another system before it’s Snowflake.</p>
<p>1121<br>00:58:54,960 –&gt; 00:58:57,960<br>The co-founder Snowflake, but another system called vector-wise,</p>
<p>1122<br>00:58:57,960 –&gt; 00:59:01,960<br>which is a four-community B, which is one of the early comms store systems.</p>
<p>1123<br>00:59:01,960 –&gt; 00:59:05,960<br>Prior to them, the vector-wise view, I think,</p>
<p>1124<br>00:59:05,960 –&gt; 00:59:07,960<br>innovated on this.</p>
<p>1125<br>00:59:07,960 –&gt; 00:59:09,960<br>Like, nobody did it this way.</p>
<p>1126<br>00:59:10,960 –&gt; 00:59:11,960<br>Just…</p>
<p>1127<br>00:59:11,960 –&gt; 00:59:13,960<br>Because they didn’t, I don’t know.</p>
<p>1128<br>00:59:13,960 –&gt; 00:59:16,960<br>The alternative is also pre…</p>
<p>1129<br>00:59:16,960 –&gt; 00:59:17,960<br>Like, you can do code generation.</p>
<p>1130<br>00:59:17,960 –&gt; 00:59:19,960<br>Like, what single store was talking about?</p>
<p>1131<br>00:59:19,960 –&gt; 00:59:21,960<br>Like, you take the query plan, they generate the YOP codes,</p>
<p>1132<br>00:59:21,960 –&gt; 00:59:23,960<br>and they compile that to machine code for every single query.</p>
<p>1133<br>00:59:23,960 –&gt; 00:59:25,960<br>The alternative is to do that.</p>
<p>1134<br>00:59:25,960 –&gt; 00:59:27,960<br>But I did that in the 70s,</p>
<p>1135<br>00:59:27,960 –&gt; 00:59:30,960<br>and then abandoned it because it was a software engineering overhead.</p>
<p>1136<br>00:59:32,960 –&gt; 00:59:35,960<br>Also, too, comms stores weren’t really a thing until the 2000s.</p>
<p>1137<br>00:59:35,960 –&gt; 00:59:37,960<br>So it didn’t really make sense.</p>
<p>1138<br>00:59:38,960 –&gt; 00:59:40,960<br>Like, for doing OTP stuff,</p>
<p>1139<br>00:59:40,960 –&gt; 00:59:41,960<br>like in a bus tub,</p>
<p>1140<br>00:59:41,960 –&gt; 00:59:42,960<br>post with my SQL system,</p>
<p>1141<br>00:59:42,960 –&gt; 00:59:44,960<br>you’re going to grab one row.</p>
<p>1142<br>00:59:44,960 –&gt; 00:59:46,960<br>It won’t make a difference.</p>
<p>1143<br>00:59:46,960 –&gt; 00:59:47,960<br>But now, if you’re doing O-lap,</p>
<p>1144<br>00:59:47,960 –&gt; 00:59:49,960<br>where you’re just ripping through an account of a billion tuples,</p>
<p>1145<br>00:59:49,960 –&gt; 00:59:51,960<br>that switch statement becomes a big bottleneck.</p>
<p>1146<br>00:59:54,960 –&gt; 00:59:57,960<br>All right, so they’re going to separate the table data from the metadata,</p>
<p>1147<br>00:59:57,960 –&gt; 00:59:58,960<br>and I’ll talk about it in a second.</p>
<p>1148<br>00:59:58,960 –&gt; 01:00:00,960<br>There is no buffer pool at every single node.</p>
<p>1149<br>01:00:00,960 –&gt; 01:00:04,960<br>There is a cache, but it’s not what we think of as traditional buffer pool.</p>
<p>1150<br>01:00:05,960 –&gt; 01:00:12,960<br>And then the internal storage format for Snorflex,</p>
<p>1151<br>01:00:12,960 –&gt; 01:00:15,960<br>Snorflex is basically packs that we talked about before.</p>
<p>1152<br>01:00:15,960 –&gt; 01:00:17,960<br>But they do support reading data from park, CSVs,</p>
<p>1153<br>01:00:17,960 –&gt; 01:00:19,960<br>and all other data types you would have.</p>
<p>1154<br>01:00:21,960 –&gt; 01:00:23,960<br>All right, so the architecture itself is,</p>
<p>1155<br>01:00:23,960 –&gt; 01:00:26,960<br>let’s take a time to go through this real quickly.</p>
<p>1156<br>01:00:26,960 –&gt; 01:00:28,960<br>But it’s just aggregate storage.</p>
<p>1157<br>01:00:28,960 –&gt; 01:00:30,960<br>So you have the compute nodes,</p>
<p>1158<br>01:00:30,960 –&gt; 01:00:31,960<br>and then you have the storage.</p>
<p>1159<br>01:00:32,960 –&gt; 01:00:35,960<br>And then all the storage is just the cloud object storage stuff we talked about before.</p>
<p>1160<br>01:00:35,960 –&gt; 01:00:38,960<br>So we talked about before about, like I said,</p>
<p>1161<br>01:00:38,960 –&gt; 01:00:39,960<br>you don’t want to use the OS for anything,</p>
<p>1162<br>01:00:39,960 –&gt; 01:00:41,960<br>but when it comes to a cloud database,</p>
<p>1163<br>01:00:41,960 –&gt; 01:00:44,960<br>it’s maybe you want to use Amazon’s S3 or Azure Storage,</p>
<p>1164<br>01:00:44,960 –&gt; 01:00:46,960<br>and aren’t giving things up.</p>
<p>1165<br>01:00:46,960 –&gt; 01:00:48,960<br>So in the research papers about Snorflex,</p>
<p>1166<br>01:00:48,960 –&gt; 01:00:51,960<br>they talk about how it made their lives so much easier</p>
<p>1167<br>01:00:51,960 –&gt; 01:00:54,960<br>to all float all that storage stuff to Amazon,</p>
<p>1168<br>01:00:54,960 –&gt; 01:00:57,960<br>and it’s worth making a really fast engine.</p>
<p>1169<br>01:00:58,960 –&gt; 01:01:01,960<br>So you can, and it gives you the flexibility of scaling out</p>
<p>1170<br>01:01:01,960 –&gt; 01:01:04,960<br>compute separately from the storage.</p>
<p>1171<br>01:01:04,960 –&gt; 01:01:08,960<br>So the sake of time, I want to skip all of this.</p>
<p>1172<br>01:01:10,960 –&gt; 01:01:12,960<br>I think we already talked about this.</p>
<p>1173<br>01:01:12,960 –&gt; 01:01:15,960<br>But let me tell one thing they do do is that it is actually interesting.</p>
<p>1174<br>01:01:16,960 –&gt; 01:01:21,960<br>So, the S3 shows up that wants to scan a lot of data, right?</p>
<p>1175<br>01:01:21,960 –&gt; 01:01:23,960<br>And say that we’re doing a simple join here,</p>
<p>1176<br>01:01:23,960 –&gt; 01:01:25,960<br>and the build side and the probe side.</p>
<p>1177<br>01:01:26,960 –&gt; 01:01:31,960<br>But let’s say that this side of the query is doing a massive scan</p>
<p>1178<br>01:01:31,960 –&gt; 01:01:34,960<br>on maybe petabytes of data.</p>
<p>1179<br>01:01:34,960 –&gt; 01:01:40,960<br>And if I have a fixed number of machines or workers</p>
<p>1180<br>01:01:40,960 –&gt; 01:01:45,960<br>to process this query, this will become a bottleneck for you.</p>
<p>1181<br>01:01:45,960 –&gt; 01:01:48,960<br>So what they have the ability to do is while the query is running,</p>
<p>1182<br>01:01:48,960 –&gt; 01:01:51,960<br>they can identify that, okay, I have to,</p>
<p>1183<br>01:01:51,960 –&gt; 01:01:53,960<br>this side is taking too long.</p>
<p>1184<br>01:01:53,960 –&gt; 01:01:59,960<br>So they can dynamically rewrite the query plan to split it up</p>
<p>1185<br>01:01:59,960 –&gt; 01:02:02,960<br>into separate operations.</p>
<p>1186<br>01:02:02,960 –&gt; 01:02:07,960<br>And in this case here, you can basically add more nodes.</p>
<p>1187<br>01:02:07,960 –&gt; 01:02:10,960<br>They start doing the table scan you need,</p>
<p>1188<br>01:02:10,960 –&gt; 01:02:13,960<br>and they’re going to write it out to one to attempt files.</p>
<p>1189<br>01:02:13,960 –&gt; 01:02:18,960<br>And then you load it back in on the regular worker nodes,</p>
<p>1190<br>01:02:18,960 –&gt; 01:02:21,960<br>they’re then doing union all, and then you produce the correct answer.</p>
<p>1191<br>01:02:21,960 –&gt; 01:02:24,960<br>So like while the query is running, they can add more nodes</p>
<p>1192<br>01:02:24,960 –&gt; 01:02:26,960<br>to scale things out dynamically.</p>
<p>1193<br>01:02:26,960 –&gt; 01:02:32,960<br>And use the user or the customer you don’t know, right?</p>
<p>1194<br>01:02:32,960 –&gt; 01:02:35,960<br>And then the enemy results are just getting it back to S3.</p>
<p>1195<br>01:02:35,960 –&gt; 01:02:38,960<br>So for them, that’s cheap and fast.</p>
<p>1196<br>01:02:38,960 –&gt; 01:02:40,960<br>Fast enough.</p>
<p>1197<br>01:02:40,960 –&gt; 01:02:42,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1198<br>01:02:42,960 –&gt; 01:02:44,960<br>Is this different from the Michela’s view?</p>
<p>1199<br>01:02:44,960 –&gt; 01:02:46,960<br>So Michela’s view would be like,</p>
<p>1200<br>01:02:46,960 –&gt; 01:02:49,960<br>I compute the answer once,</p>
<p>1201<br>01:02:49,960 –&gt; 01:02:53,960<br>and then other queries can then reuse that result.</p>
<p>1202<br>01:02:53,960 –&gt; 01:02:56,960<br>And then if the table gets updated or anything gets updated,</p>
<p>1203<br>01:02:56,960 –&gt; 01:02:58,960<br>then it gets automatically updated.</p>
<p>1204<br>01:02:58,960 –&gt; 01:03:02,960<br>This is just for a single query, yes.</p>
<p>1205<br>01:03:02,960 –&gt; 01:03:09,960<br>And also too, I don’t think this thing supports incremental updates.</p>
<p>1206<br>01:03:09,960 –&gt; 01:03:12,960<br>Like Delta, something like that.</p>
<p>1207<br>01:03:12,960 –&gt; 01:03:18,960<br>Is this done like basically a process?</p>
<p>1208<br>01:03:18,960 –&gt; 01:03:21,960<br>The question is, how do they figure this out?</p>
<p>1209<br>01:03:21,960 –&gt; 01:03:26,960<br>Is this done while it’s running or is it done before it starts running?</p>
<p>1210<br>01:03:26,960 –&gt; 01:03:28,960<br>Actually, I think I missedpoke.</p>
<p>1211<br>01:03:28,960 –&gt; 01:03:30,960<br>It’s done at query optimization time.</p>
<p>1212<br>01:03:30,960 –&gt; 01:03:33,960<br>So they look at it, they know how much data you’re going to read,</p>
<p>1213<br>01:03:33,960 –&gt; 01:03:36,960<br>they know that this is going to be a bottleneck.</p>
<p>1214<br>01:03:36,960 –&gt; 01:03:39,960<br>Therefore they can give you a resources ahead of time.</p>
<p>1215<br>01:03:39,960 –&gt; 01:03:41,960<br>The estimation I think, yes.</p>
<p>1216<br>01:03:41,960 –&gt; 01:03:43,960<br>What’s the edge of the thing about is that the extra resources</p>
<p>1217<br>01:03:43,960 –&gt; 01:03:47,960<br>they’re coming from, they’re not like things you have to pre-allocate.</p>
<p>1218<br>01:03:47,960 –&gt; 01:03:50,960<br>They have basically like a bullpen or like a spare worker pool.</p>
<p>1219<br>01:03:50,960 –&gt; 01:03:52,960<br>I think you can borrow nodes from other customers</p>
<p>1220<br>01:03:52,960 –&gt; 01:03:55,960<br>because none of the covers of this is all hidden from you.</p>
<p>1221<br>01:03:55,960 –&gt; 01:03:58,960<br>So you basically say, say you pay for like, I want five compute nodes.</p>
<p>1222<br>01:03:58,960 –&gt; 01:04:00,960<br>This query shows up and they’ll give you maybe a few extra</p>
<p>1223<br>01:04:00,960 –&gt; 01:04:04,960<br>just to finish the query and you’re borrowing them from somebody else.</p>
<p>1224<br>01:04:04,960 –&gt; 01:04:07,960<br>And that’s all hidden from you.</p>
<p>1225<br>01:04:07,960 –&gt; 01:04:11,960<br>Because otherwise they would be idle.</p>
<p>1226<br>01:04:11,960 –&gt; 01:04:12,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1227<br>01:04:12,960 –&gt; 01:04:16,960<br>Again, so snowflake, again, it’s a distributed share data.</p>
<p>1228<br>01:04:16,960 –&gt; 01:04:21,960<br>ShareDesk, vectorized push-based O-lap engine</p>
<p>1229<br>01:04:21,960 –&gt; 01:04:23,960<br>that runs entirely off of…</p>
<p>1230<br>01:04:23,960 –&gt; 01:04:25,960<br>They originally started on S3,</p>
<p>1231<br>01:04:25,960 –&gt; 01:04:27,960<br>but they support other cloud platforms as well.</p>
<p>1232<br>01:04:27,960 –&gt; 01:04:31,960<br>And remember, I think the Marcin, the co-founder,</p>
<p>1233<br>01:04:31,960 –&gt; 01:04:33,960<br>like in the early days, people are asking,</p>
<p>1234<br>01:04:33,960 –&gt; 01:04:34,960<br>you know, you’re crazy to be cloud native.</p>
<p>1235<br>01:04:34,960 –&gt; 01:04:36,960<br>You know, I went around on-prem, make it around on-prem.</p>
<p>1236<br>01:04:36,960 –&gt; 01:04:38,960<br>And they made the hard choice of deciding not to do that,</p>
<p>1237<br>01:04:38,960 –&gt; 01:04:40,960<br>even though some customers were offering their money</p>
<p>1238<br>01:04:40,960 –&gt; 01:04:42,960<br>and in the end it paid off.</p>
<p>1239<br>01:04:42,960 –&gt; 01:04:46,960<br>And they went IPO 2018, 2017.</p>
<p>1240<br>01:04:46,960 –&gt; 01:04:48,960<br>They went IPO in five years.</p>
<p>1241<br>01:04:48,960 –&gt; 01:04:50,960<br>It’s amazing.</p>
<p>1242<br>01:04:50,960 –&gt; 01:04:51,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1243<br>01:04:51,960 –&gt; 01:04:53,960<br>So this is the day we said that was voted for the most.</p>
<p>1244<br>01:04:53,960 –&gt; 01:04:55,960<br>MangerDB.</p>
<p>1245<br>01:04:55,960 –&gt; 01:04:57,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>1246<br>01:04:57,960 –&gt; 01:04:58,960<br>That’s the best logo I could find.</p>
<p>1247<br>01:04:58,960 –&gt; 01:04:59,960<br>It’s the only logo I find.</p>
<p>1248<br>01:04:59,960 –&gt; 01:05:00,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>1249<br>01:05:00,960 –&gt; 01:05:02,960<br>So what does MangerDB?</p>
<p>1250<br>01:05:02,960 –&gt; 01:05:05,960<br>So MangerDB is a satirical implementation of MongoDB.</p>
<p>1251<br>01:05:05,960 –&gt; 01:05:06,960<br>It’s written in Python.</p>
<p>1252<br>01:05:06,960 –&gt; 01:05:09,960<br>I can’t run it because it only supports an older version of Python</p>
<p>1253<br>01:05:09,960 –&gt; 01:05:10,960<br>and libraries.</p>
<p>1254<br>01:05:10,960 –&gt; 01:05:14,960<br>And only supports the MangerDB wire protocol up to version two.</p>
<p>1255<br>01:05:14,960 –&gt; 01:05:21,960<br>So the key idea of MangerDB is that all the data is written to DevNall.</p>
<p>1256<br>01:05:21,960 –&gt; 01:05:25,960<br>And so the reason why with the joke is based on is that</p>
<p>1257<br>01:05:25,960 –&gt; 01:05:27,960<br>the original version of MangerDB,</p>
<p>1258<br>01:05:27,960 –&gt; 01:05:30,960<br>like this thing, like 2009, 2008, 2010,</p>
<p>1259<br>01:05:30,960 –&gt; 01:05:35,960<br>that they would put out these blog articles or these social media posts</p>
<p>1260<br>01:05:35,960 –&gt; 01:05:39,960<br>showing how much faster MangerDB was than every other database system.</p>
<p>1261<br>01:05:40,960 –&gt; 01:05:43,960<br>And part of the trick that MangerDB was doing is that</p>
<p>1262<br>01:05:43,960 –&gt; 01:05:45,960<br>when you wrote to the database system,</p>
<p>1263<br>01:05:45,960 –&gt; 01:05:48,960<br>you sent a right request to MangerDB,</p>
<p>1264<br>01:05:48,960 –&gt; 01:05:51,960<br>they would immediately come back with an acknowledgment and say,</p>
<p>1265<br>01:05:51,960 –&gt; 01:05:52,960<br>yep, we got it.</p>
<p>1266<br>01:05:52,960 –&gt; 01:05:53,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>1267<br>01:05:53,960 –&gt; 01:05:55,960<br>And that was the benchmark numbers they were reporting.</p>
<p>1268<br>01:05:55,960 –&gt; 01:05:57,960<br>Like them versus my SQL versus Postgres.</p>
<p>1269<br>01:05:57,960 –&gt; 01:05:58,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>1270<br>01:05:58,960 –&gt; 01:06:00,960<br>And the obvious reason why that’s a bad idea,</p>
<p>1271<br>01:06:00,960 –&gt; 01:06:02,960<br>because it wasn’t that, oh, you know,</p>
<p>1272<br>01:06:02,960 –&gt; 01:06:03,960<br>not that you even started running the query.</p>
<p>1273<br>01:06:03,960 –&gt; 01:06:06,960<br>You just got the message on the server side.</p>
<p>1274<br>01:06:07,960 –&gt; 01:06:11,960<br>And there was no guarantee that that right request would actually get written to disk.</p>
<p>1275<br>01:06:11,960 –&gt; 01:06:14,960<br>If you wanted to know whether your right was actually written to disk,</p>
<p>1276<br>01:06:14,960 –&gt; 01:06:16,960<br>you then had to send another request and say, hey,</p>
<p>1277<br>01:06:16,960 –&gt; 01:06:17,960<br>I think it is totally to write.</p>
<p>1278<br>01:06:17,960 –&gt; 01:06:18,960<br>Did you actually write it?</p>
<p>1279<br>01:06:18,960 –&gt; 01:06:20,960<br>And it would block and to actually did it.</p>
<p>1280<br>01:06:20,960 –&gt; 01:06:22,960<br>So this obviously meant that, like,</p>
<p>1281<br>01:06:22,960 –&gt; 01:06:25,960<br>if you were doing a lot of rights in your application,</p>
<p>1282<br>01:06:25,960 –&gt; 01:06:27,960<br>and there was a crash, which, of course,</p>
<p>1283<br>01:06:27,960 –&gt; 01:06:29,960<br>every system was going to crash at some point,</p>
<p>1284<br>01:06:29,960 –&gt; 01:06:32,960<br>that there’s no guarantee that things you actually thought were written</p>
<p>1285<br>01:06:33,960 –&gt; 01:06:35,960<br>but then some time window were actually made at the disk.</p>
<p>1286<br>01:06:35,960 –&gt; 01:06:38,960<br>There’s other things they did in the early days too,</p>
<p>1287<br>01:06:38,960 –&gt; 01:06:40,960<br>because they were using M-MAP instead of a Bufferple manager,</p>
<p>1288<br>01:06:40,960 –&gt; 01:06:44,960<br>that they had a single database lock.</p>
<p>1289<br>01:06:44,960 –&gt; 01:06:47,960<br>So even though, again, going back where you were staying before,</p>
<p>1290<br>01:06:47,960 –&gt; 01:06:49,960<br>like, you know, if you can’t,</p>
<p>1291<br>01:06:49,960 –&gt; 01:06:50,960<br>if you don’t have one writer reader,</p>
<p>1292<br>01:06:50,960 –&gt; 01:06:52,960<br>is that really multi-threaded?</p>
<p>1293<br>01:06:52,960 –&gt; 01:06:53,960<br>So it was basically the same idea.</p>
<p>1294<br>01:06:53,960 –&gt; 01:06:55,960<br>They had a single exclusive lock on the disk.</p>
<p>1295<br>01:06:55,960 –&gt; 01:06:56,960<br>And in the end, you didn’t update.</p>
<p>1296<br>01:06:56,960 –&gt; 01:06:58,960<br>It would lock the whole database system.</p>
<p>1297<br>01:06:58,960 –&gt; 01:06:59,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>1298<br>01:06:59,960 –&gt; 01:07:01,960<br>Because they couldn’t handle doing multi-updits.</p>
<p>1299<br>01:07:02,960 –&gt; 01:07:04,960<br>The M-MAP stuff was a whole other on a ball wax.</p>
<p>1300<br>01:07:04,960 –&gt; 01:07:08,960<br>So I know I don’t like to show you guys source code,</p>
<p>1301<br>01:07:08,960 –&gt; 01:07:10,960<br>but we can look at source code from MangleDB,</p>
<p>1302<br>01:07:10,960 –&gt; 01:07:11,960<br>because this is it.</p>
<p>1303<br>01:07:11,960 –&gt; 01:07:15,960<br>This is literally the entire, this is the literally entire database system.</p>
<p>1304<br>01:07:15,960 –&gt; 01:07:18,960<br>So the first thing to point out here,</p>
<p>1305<br>01:07:18,960 –&gt; 01:07:19,960<br>and this line here,</p>
<p>1306<br>01:07:19,960 –&gt; 01:07:24,960<br>they open up a photo script here to DevNo, fantastic.</p>
<p>1307<br>01:07:24,960 –&gt; 01:07:25,960<br>Great.</p>
<p>1308<br>01:07:25,960 –&gt; 01:07:26,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1309<br>01:07:26,960 –&gt; 01:07:27,960<br>Then down in here,</p>
<p>1310<br>01:07:27,960 –&gt; 01:07:29,960<br>this is actually, if a command shows up,</p>
<p>1311<br>01:07:29,960 –&gt; 01:07:35,960<br>so by is telling you to disconnect,</p>
<p>1312<br>01:07:35,960 –&gt; 01:07:37,960<br>wait is waiting for,</p>
<p>1313<br>01:07:37,960 –&gt; 01:07:39,960<br>wait,</p>
<p>1314<br>01:07:39,960 –&gt; 01:07:41,960<br>a conditional lock up there.</p>
<p>1315<br>01:07:41,960 –&gt; 01:07:42,960<br>Right.</p>
<p>1316<br>01:07:42,960 –&gt; 01:07:44,960<br>So this is actually command actually doing something.</p>
<p>1317<br>01:07:44,960 –&gt; 01:07:46,960<br>So there’s our single global lock entire database system.</p>
<p>1318<br>01:07:46,960 –&gt; 01:07:47,960<br>We require that.</p>
<p>1319<br>01:07:47,960 –&gt; 01:07:49,960<br>Then we write out whatever you sent over the wire</p>
<p>1320<br>01:07:49,960 –&gt; 01:07:51,960<br>to the database server to DevNo,</p>
<p>1321<br>01:07:51,960 –&gt; 01:07:52,960<br>fantastic, right.</p>
<p>1322<br>01:07:52,960 –&gt; 01:07:53,960<br>And then they have,</p>
<p>1323<br>01:07:53,960 –&gt; 01:07:55,960<br>if you’re in durable mode,</p>
<p>1324<br>01:07:55,960 –&gt; 01:07:58,960<br>they’ll flush the output buffer.</p>
<p>1325<br>01:07:58,960 –&gt; 01:08:01,960<br>And then you do an fsync on the photo scripter,</p>
<p>1326<br>01:08:01,960 –&gt; 01:08:02,960<br>which is DevNo,</p>
<p>1327<br>01:08:02,960 –&gt; 01:08:04,960<br>so it comes back immediately.</p>
<p>1328<br>01:08:04,960 –&gt; 01:08:06,960<br>And then if you’re running with</p>
<p>1329<br>01:08:06,960 –&gt; 01:08:08,960<br>eventual consistency mode,</p>
<p>1330<br>01:08:08,960 –&gt; 01:08:09,960<br>then no matter what you,</p>
<p>1331<br>01:08:09,960 –&gt; 01:08:10,960<br>what you send us,</p>
<p>1332<br>01:08:10,960 –&gt; 01:08:12,960<br>we’ll send the server to get back 42.</p>
<p>1333<br>01:08:12,960 –&gt; 01:08:13,960<br>Otherwise,</p>
<p>1334<br>01:08:13,960 –&gt; 01:08:15,960<br>you get a random value, right.</p>
<p>1335<br>01:08:15,960 –&gt; 01:08:17,960<br>And then you release the lock.</p>
<p>1336<br>01:08:17,960 –&gt; 01:08:19,960<br>So this is, you know,</p>
<p>1337<br>01:08:19,960 –&gt; 01:08:20,960<br>the joke is again,</p>
<p>1338<br>01:08:20,960 –&gt; 01:08:21,960<br>is this good as MangleDB?</p>
<p>1339<br>01:08:21,960 –&gt; 01:08:22,960<br>Well,</p>
<p>1340<br>01:08:22,960 –&gt; 01:08:23,960<br>if you care about your data,</p>
<p>1341<br>01:08:23,960 –&gt; 01:08:24,960<br>you would obviously wouldn’t want to use this,</p>
<p>1342<br>01:08:24,960 –&gt; 01:08:25,960<br>and you probably wouldn’t want to use</p>
<p>1343<br>01:08:25,960 –&gt; 01:08:27,960<br>early versions of MangleDB.</p>
<p>1344<br>01:08:27,960 –&gt; 01:08:28,960<br>What’s that?</p>
<p>1345<br>01:08:28,960 –&gt; 01:08:29,960<br>It’s WebScale.</p>
<p>1346<br>01:08:29,960 –&gt; 01:08:30,960<br>That video we cannot show,</p>
<p>1347<br>01:08:30,960 –&gt; 01:08:32,960<br>because it’s a lot of profanity there.</p>
<p>1348<br>01:08:32,960 –&gt; 01:08:34,960<br>We can close that later.</p>
<p>1349<br>01:08:34,960 –&gt; 01:08:36,960<br>Just Google MangleDB WebScale.</p>
<p>1350<br>01:08:36,960 –&gt; 01:08:37,960<br>You’ll see it.</p>
<p>1351<br>01:08:37,960 –&gt; 01:08:38,960<br>It’s a cartoon.</p>
<p>1352<br>01:08:38,960 –&gt; 01:08:43,960<br>So I’m not trying to pick on MangleDB, right.</p>
<p>1353<br>01:08:43,960 –&gt; 01:08:49,960<br>The sort of,</p>
<p>1354<br>01:08:49,960 –&gt; 01:08:50,960<br>how this is,</p>
<p>1355<br>01:08:50,960 –&gt; 01:08:51,960<br>the playbook,</p>
<p>1356<br>01:08:51,960 –&gt; 01:08:52,960<br>if you will,</p>
<p>1357<br>01:08:52,960 –&gt; 01:08:54,960<br>of what MangleDB does,</p>
<p>1358<br>01:08:54,960 –&gt; 01:08:57,960<br>what MangleDB did to get become successful,</p>
<p>1359<br>01:08:57,960 –&gt; 01:08:58,960<br>has been done before,</p>
<p>1360<br>01:08:58,960 –&gt; 01:08:59,960<br>meaning put out a,</p>
<p>1361<br>01:08:59,960 –&gt; 01:09:00,960<br>quote unquote,</p>
<p>1362<br>01:09:00,960 –&gt; 01:09:01,960<br>inferior product</p>
<p>1363<br>01:09:01,960 –&gt; 01:09:02,960<br>that people like to use,</p>
<p>1364<br>01:09:02,960 –&gt; 01:09:03,960<br>because it’s easy,</p>
<p>1365<br>01:09:03,960 –&gt; 01:09:04,960<br>and it’s new,</p>
<p>1366<br>01:09:04,960 –&gt; 01:09:05,960<br>and it’s exciting,</p>
<p>1367<br>01:09:05,960 –&gt; 01:09:07,960<br>get enough traction,</p>
<p>1368<br>01:09:07,960 –&gt; 01:09:09,960<br>where that you get enough money</p>
<p>1369<br>01:09:09,960 –&gt; 01:09:11,960<br>to then hire engineers to go</p>
<p>1370<br>01:09:11,960 –&gt; 01:09:13,960<br>pay off that technical debt</p>
<p>1371<br>01:09:13,960 –&gt; 01:09:15,960<br>of the mistakes you made.</p>
<p>1372<br>01:09:15,960 –&gt; 01:09:17,960<br>Like, that MangleDB was,</p>
<p>1373<br>01:09:17,960 –&gt; 01:09:18,960<br>and the first one did that.</p>
<p>1374<br>01:09:18,960 –&gt; 01:09:19,960<br>That was,</p>
<p>1375<br>01:09:19,960 –&gt; 01:09:20,960<br>but my SQL did in the 90s.</p>
<p>1376<br>01:09:20,960 –&gt; 01:09:21,960<br>My SQL,</p>
<p>1377<br>01:09:21,960 –&gt; 01:09:22,960<br>the original,</p>
<p>1378<br>01:09:22,960 –&gt; 01:09:23,960<br>the storage engine,</p>
<p>1379<br>01:09:23,960 –&gt; 01:09:24,960<br>it was called my ISAM,</p>
<p>1380<br>01:09:24,960 –&gt; 01:09:25,960<br>that thing was total crap.</p>
<p>1381<br>01:09:25,960 –&gt; 01:09:26,960<br>They would lose data,</p>
<p>1382<br>01:09:26,960 –&gt; 01:09:27,960<br>couldn’t handle transactions.</p>
<p>1383<br>01:09:27,960 –&gt; 01:09:29,960<br>You would corrupt the Davis all the time.</p>
<p>1384<br>01:09:29,960 –&gt; 01:09:30,960<br>And then,</p>
<p>1385<br>01:09:30,960 –&gt; 01:09:31,960<br>NDB came along</p>
<p>1386<br>01:09:31,960 –&gt; 01:09:32,960<br>and fixed all those things,</p>
<p>1387<br>01:09:32,960 –&gt; 01:09:33,960<br>and now you would not</p>
<p>1388<br>01:09:33,960 –&gt; 01:09:34,960<br>want to use my ISAM.</p>
<p>1389<br>01:09:34,960 –&gt; 01:09:35,960<br>But before my SQL,</p>
<p>1390<br>01:09:35,960 –&gt; 01:09:36,960<br>this is what Oracle did.</p>
<p>1391<br>01:09:36,960 –&gt; 01:09:37,960<br>Oracle was a garbage system,</p>
<p>1392<br>01:09:37,960 –&gt; 01:09:39,960<br>in the 70s and the 80s.</p>
<p>1393<br>01:09:39,960 –&gt; 01:09:41,960<br>Ingress,</p>
<p>1394<br>01:09:41,960 –&gt; 01:09:44,960<br>the predecessor to Postgres,</p>
<p>1395<br>01:09:44,960 –&gt; 01:09:46,960<br>that was considered</p>
<p>1396<br>01:09:46,960 –&gt; 01:09:48,960<br>the better database system,</p>
<p>1397<br>01:09:48,960 –&gt; 01:09:50,960<br>but Oracle got better traction,</p>
<p>1398<br>01:09:50,960 –&gt; 01:09:52,960<br>because they made a bunch of claims,</p>
<p>1399<br>01:09:52,960 –&gt; 01:09:53,960<br>about what it could do,</p>
<p>1400<br>01:09:53,960 –&gt; 01:09:54,960<br>that in the future,</p>
<p>1401<br>01:09:54,960 –&gt; 01:09:55,960<br>that eventually they got there,</p>
<p>1402<br>01:09:55,960 –&gt; 01:09:56,960<br>and they got big enough,</p>
<p>1403<br>01:09:56,960 –&gt; 01:09:57,960<br>where they could hire enough people to fix it.</p>
<p>1404<br>01:09:57,960 –&gt; 01:09:59,960<br>And now, Oracle is a solid database system.</p>
<p>1405<br>01:09:59,960 –&gt; 01:10:01,960<br>So again, I’m not trying to pick on Mangle.</p>
<p>1406<br>01:10:01,960 –&gt; 01:10:02,960<br>This is,</p>
<p>1407<br>01:10:02,960 –&gt; 01:10:04,960<br>you can think of like,</p>
<p>1408<br>01:10:04,960 –&gt; 01:10:06,960<br>it’s a marketing way to say,</p>
<p>1409<br>01:10:06,960 –&gt; 01:10:07,960<br>you sort of sell the,</p>
<p>1410<br>01:10:07,960 –&gt; 01:10:08,960<br>you know, sell the stake,</p>
<p>1411<br>01:10:08,960 –&gt; 01:10:09,960<br>you sell the sizzle.</p>
<p>1412<br>01:10:09,960 –&gt; 01:10:10,960<br>So you sell your data system,</p>
<p>1413<br>01:10:10,960 –&gt; 01:10:11,960<br>it’s going to solve all the world’s problems,</p>
<p>1414<br>01:10:11,960 –&gt; 01:10:12,960<br>it’s state of the art,</p>
<p>1415<br>01:10:12,960 –&gt; 01:10:13,960<br>yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>1416<br>01:10:13,960 –&gt; 01:10:14,960<br>And then,</p>
<p>1417<br>01:10:14,960 –&gt; 01:10:15,960<br>yeah, people get burned along the way,</p>
<p>1418<br>01:10:15,960 –&gt; 01:10:16,960<br>but whatever, right?</p>
<p>1419<br>01:10:16,960 –&gt; 01:10:18,960<br>And then you get the money to fix things.</p>
<p>1420<br>01:10:18,960 –&gt; 01:10:19,960<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1421<br>01:10:19,960 –&gt; 01:10:21,960<br>So maybe it’s anyone’s mission credit,</p>
<p>1422<br>01:10:21,960 –&gt; 01:10:24,960<br>but I’m very, very, very,</p>
<p>1423<br>01:10:24,960 –&gt; 01:10:26,960<br>that is the ability to make these confirmations.</p>
<p>1424<br>01:10:26,960 –&gt; 01:10:27,960<br>Mangle DB?</p>
<p>1425<br>01:10:27,960 –&gt; 01:10:28,960<br>OK, sorry.</p>
<p>1426<br>01:10:28,960 –&gt; 01:10:29,960<br>You pointed,</p>
<p>1427<br>01:10:29,960 –&gt; 01:10:31,960<br>it’s always like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>1428<br>01:10:31,960 –&gt; 01:10:32,960<br>You pointed,</p>
<p>1429<br>01:10:32,960 –&gt; 01:10:33,960<br>it’s always like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>1430<br>01:10:33,960 –&gt; 01:10:34,960<br>I mean,</p>
<p>1431<br>01:10:34,960 –&gt; 01:10:35,960<br>the question is,</p>
<p>1432<br>01:10:35,960 –&gt; 01:10:36,960<br>is it OK to use like,</p>
<p>1433<br>01:10:36,960 –&gt; 01:10:38,960<br>bleeding edge database software,</p>
<p>1434<br>01:10:38,960 –&gt; 01:10:39,960<br>if it’s,</p>
<p>1435<br>01:10:39,960 –&gt; 01:10:40,960<br>for mission credit applications,</p>
<p>1436<br>01:10:40,960 –&gt; 01:10:41,960<br>if it’s,</p>
<p>1437<br>01:10:41,960 –&gt; 01:10:42,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1438<br>01:10:42,960 –&gt; 01:10:43,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1439<br>01:10:43,960 –&gt; 01:10:44,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1440<br>01:10:44,960 –&gt; 01:10:45,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1441<br>01:10:45,960 –&gt; 01:10:46,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1442<br>01:10:46,960 –&gt; 01:10:47,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1443<br>01:10:47,960 –&gt; 01:10:48,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1444<br>01:10:48,960 –&gt; 01:10:50,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1445<br>01:10:50,960 –&gt; 01:10:51,960<br>it’s going to be,</p>
<p>1446<br>01:10:51,960 –&gt; 01:10:52,960<br>it’s going to be,</p>
<p>1447<br>01:10:52,960 –&gt; 01:10:53,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1448<br>01:10:53,960 –&gt; 01:10:54,960<br>it’s not going to be.</p>
<p>1449<br>01:10:54,960 –&gt; 01:10:55,960<br>Y have gone quite a few years,</p>
<p>1450<br>01:10:55,960 –&gt; 01:10:56,960<br>it’s not going to be,</p>
<p>1451<br>01:10:56,960 –&gt; 01:10:58,960<br>sort of electing on your job</p>
<p>1452<br>01:10:58,960 –&gt; 01:10:59,960<br>and ever undergoing care sometimes.</p>
<p>1453<br>01:10:59,960 –&gt; 01:11:00,960<br>Because,</p>
<p>1454<br>01:11:00,960 –&gt; 01:11:03,960<br>your job is to make progress</p>
<p>1455<br>01:11:03,960 –&gt; 01:11:04,960<br>ambitious.</p>
<p>1456<br>01:11:04,960 –&gt; 01:11:06,960<br>They’re going to be airport</p>
<p>1457<br>01:11:06,960 –&gt; 01:11:07,960<br>jobs,</p>
<p>1458<br>01:11:07,960 –&gt; 01:11:10,960<br>they’re going to be overwhelmed</p>
<p>1459<br>01:11:10,960 –&gt; 01:11:13,199<br>and are going to teach you</p>
<p>1460<br>01:11:13,199 –&gt; 01:11:13,960<br>what to do.</p>
<p>1461<br>01:11:13,960 –&gt; 01:11:15,960<br>But the thing that I’m reminding</p>
<p>1462<br>01:11:15,960 –&gt; 01:11:16,960<br>us from now,</p>
<p>1463<br>01:11:16,960 –&gt; 01:11:18,960<br>other newer systems that can do it.</p>
<p>1464<br>01:11:18,960 –&gt; 01:11:19,960<br>Right?</p>
<p>1465<br>01:11:19,960 –&gt; 01:11:21,960<br>But yeah, if it’s mission critical,</p>
<p>1466<br>01:11:21,960 –&gt; 01:11:24,600<br>I would say also too,</p>
<p>1467<br>01:11:24,600 –&gt; 01:11:25,760<br>like all the things that</p>
<p>1468<br>01:11:25,760 –&gt; 01:11:27,359<br>the NoSQL guys say were a bad idea,</p>
<p>1469<br>01:11:27,359 –&gt; 01:11:29,039<br>SQL obviously in the name,</p>
<p>1470<br>01:11:29,039 –&gt; 01:11:30,399<br>they do like transactions,</p>
<p>1471<br>01:11:30,399 –&gt; 01:11:31,880<br>they didn’t like joins,</p>
<p>1472<br>01:11:31,880 –&gt; 01:11:33,840<br>all of them have added those things.</p>
<p>1473<br>01:11:33,840 –&gt; 01:11:35,920<br>So the intellectual distance between</p>
<p>1474<br>01:11:35,920 –&gt; 01:11:38,279<br>a NoSQL system and a relational data system,</p>
<p>1475<br>01:11:38,279 –&gt; 01:11:42,760<br>at some point, there is going to be no difference.</p>
<p>1476<br>01:11:42,760 –&gt; 01:11:44,600<br>So all the things they say were a bad idea,</p>
<p>1477<br>01:11:44,600 –&gt; 01:11:46,200<br>and for me,</p>
<p>1478<br>01:11:46,200 –&gt; 01:11:49,160<br>is like SQL maximalists are a pierist,</p>
<p>1479<br>01:11:49,160 –&gt; 01:11:51,240<br>that I’m saying, oh, you don’t want to be,</p>
<p>1480<br>01:11:51,240 –&gt; 01:11:52,079<br>you don’t want to do,</p>
<p>1481<br>01:11:52,079 –&gt; 01:11:53,079<br>you don’t want to not do transactions,</p>
<p>1482<br>01:11:53,079 –&gt; 01:11:54,600<br>you don’t want to not do SQL,</p>
<p>1483<br>01:11:54,600 –&gt; 01:11:55,920<br>turns out they eventually came around</p>
<p>1484<br>01:11:55,920 –&gt; 01:11:59,120<br>and added support for it.</p>
<p>1485<br>01:11:59,120 –&gt; 01:12:01,760<br>So the only NoSQL system that doesn’t support SQL now</p>
<p>1486<br>01:12:01,760 –&gt; 01:12:03,000<br>is actually redis.</p>
<p>1487<br>01:12:03,000 –&gt; 01:12:04,680<br>There’s a clone for that,</p>
<p>1488<br>01:12:04,680 –&gt; 01:12:07,600<br>but again, it’s primarily being used for a cache.</p>
<p>1489<br>01:12:07,600 –&gt; 01:12:09,920<br>I know the MongoDB co-founder,</p>
<p>1490<br>01:12:09,920 –&gt; 01:12:11,600<br>he’s not there anymore, the CTO,</p>
<p>1491<br>01:12:11,600 –&gt; 01:12:14,240<br>he helped out in an earlier</p>
<p>1492<br>01:12:14,239 –&gt; 01:12:17,199<br>is when I was at CMU with research funding,</p>
<p>1493<br>01:12:17,199 –&gt; 01:12:18,519<br>and I remember him telling me,</p>
<p>1494<br>01:12:18,519 –&gt; 01:12:19,319<br>during the study office,</p>
<p>1495<br>01:12:19,319 –&gt; 01:12:21,079<br>I was like, oh, MongoDB would never support SQL,</p>
<p>1496<br>01:12:21,079 –&gt; 01:12:22,079<br>never going to happen.</p>
<p>1497<br>01:12:22,079 –&gt; 01:12:23,639<br>The ad of it two years ago,</p>
<p>1498<br>01:12:23,639 –&gt; 01:12:26,319<br>it’s after he left, but still.</p>
<p>1499<br>01:12:26,319 –&gt; 01:12:30,199<br>So don’t want your data devnal,</p>
<p>1500<br>01:12:31,399 –&gt; 01:12:33,840<br>and I think, again, for mission critical data,</p>
<p>1501<br>01:12:33,840 –&gt; 01:12:36,639<br>I don’t think shiny new things are a good idea.</p>
<p>1502<br>01:12:36,640 –&gt; 01:12:38,480<br>I meant it’s the hardware and support.</p>
<p>1503<br>01:12:38,480 –&gt; 01:12:39,760<br>So it’s the Intel CPU,</p>
<p>1504<br>01:12:39,760 –&gt; 01:12:41,480<br>it’s the support that managed to recover,</p>
<p>1505<br>01:12:41,480 –&gt; 01:12:44,240<br>so the hardware has been recovered</p>
<p>1506<br>01:12:44,240 –&gt; 01:12:47,400<br>even the L12LC data on the radio.</p>
<p>1507<br>01:12:47,400 –&gt; 01:12:49,680<br>Yeah, so Intel has this ADR stuff.</p>
<p>1508<br>01:12:49,680 –&gt; 01:12:50,640<br>I think it’s also rad as well,</p>
<p>1509<br>01:12:50,640 –&gt; 01:12:52,640<br>like writing to the district, yeah.</p>
<p>1510<br>01:12:54,400 –&gt; 01:12:56,720<br>If the hardware does it, is that coming off?</p>
<p>1511<br>01:12:56,720 –&gt; 01:12:57,720<br>Well, I mean,</p>
<p>1512<br>01:12:59,680 –&gt; 01:13:00,880<br>well, no, because again,</p>
<p>1513<br>01:13:00,880 –&gt; 01:13:02,119<br>there’s the whole smash we were talking about.</p>
<p>1514<br>01:13:02,119 –&gt; 01:13:04,119<br>Like, things got written to the desk,</p>
<p>1515<br>01:13:04,599 –&gt; 01:13:08,159<br>I don’t, can you bring back the program state exactly?</p>
<p>1516<br>01:13:08,159 –&gt; 01:13:09,000<br>The program account?</p>
<p>1517<br>01:13:09,000 –&gt; 01:13:09,840<br>I don’t think it can.</p>
<p>1518<br>01:13:11,000 –&gt; 01:13:11,840<br>Right?</p>
<p>1519<br>01:13:11,840 –&gt; 01:13:13,079<br>So the problem there is like,</p>
<p>1520<br>01:13:13,079 –&gt; 01:13:15,279<br>if there’s a bug in your software,</p>
<p>1521<br>01:13:15,279 –&gt; 01:13:17,159<br>and like it starts going down some copat</p>
<p>1522<br>01:13:17,159 –&gt; 01:13:18,000<br>that shouldn’t have,</p>
<p>1523<br>01:13:18,000 –&gt; 01:13:20,599<br>and it starts writing data to your disk,</p>
<p>1524<br>01:13:20,599 –&gt; 01:13:22,159<br>the hardware thinks that’s fine,</p>
<p>1525<br>01:13:22,159 –&gt; 01:13:23,800<br>software’s broken though.</p>
<p>1526<br>01:13:23,800 –&gt; 01:13:25,519<br>You gotta recover from that.</p>
<p>1527<br>01:13:25,519 –&gt; 01:13:27,000<br>And so if you can’t guarantee strong</p>
<p>1528<br>01:13:27,000 –&gt; 01:13:27,880<br>consistent transactions,</p>
<p>1529<br>01:13:27,880 –&gt; 01:13:29,880<br>like, I mean, across the two nodes,</p>
<p>1530<br>01:13:29,880 –&gt; 01:13:31,239<br>then that’s gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>1531<br>01:13:32,199 –&gt; 01:13:35,239<br>So, you know, as much as I seem like a,</p>
<p>1532<br>01:13:36,880 –&gt; 01:13:38,639<br>as a person that kind of has loose morals,</p>
<p>1533<br>01:13:38,639 –&gt; 01:13:39,639<br>Nethylbright word,</p>
<p>1534<br>01:13:41,039 –&gt; 01:13:42,079<br>when it comes to databases,</p>
<p>1535<br>01:13:42,079 –&gt; 01:13:44,000<br>like, I’m super cautious, right?</p>
<p>1536<br>01:13:44,000 –&gt; 01:13:44,840<br>Because you don’t,</p>
<p>1537<br>01:13:46,760 –&gt; 01:13:47,840<br>it’s like the operating system.</p>
<p>1538<br>01:13:47,840 –&gt; 01:13:48,679<br>It’s like,</p>
<p>1539<br>01:13:48,679 –&gt; 01:13:52,559<br>it’s the core foundation of a software system,</p>
<p>1540<br>01:13:52,559 –&gt; 01:13:55,159<br>and that kind of thing you don’t wanna mess around with.</p>
<p>1541<br>01:13:56,159 –&gt; 01:13:57,519<br>You wanna use JavaScript?</p>
<p>1542<br>01:13:57,519 –&gt; 01:13:58,479<br>The application, that’s fine.</p>
<p>1543<br>01:13:58,479 –&gt; 01:13:59,920<br>Put it all over there.</p>
<p>1544<br>01:13:59,920 –&gt; 01:14:02,159<br>Data system should be written in something more serious.</p>
<p>1545<br>01:14:03,239 –&gt; 01:14:04,920<br>That’s gonna be emails, okay.</p>
<p>1546<br>01:14:04,920 –&gt; 01:14:07,680<br>I’m gonna show one more fun system.</p>
<p>1547<br>01:14:07,680 –&gt; 01:14:09,720<br>This to me, this is the,</p>
<p>1548<br>01:14:09,720 –&gt; 01:14:10,560<br>I’m jealous,</p>
<p>1549<br>01:14:10,560 –&gt; 01:14:11,399<br>because this is actually,</p>
<p>1550<br>01:14:11,399 –&gt; 01:14:12,480<br>I wish I invented this system.</p>
<p>1551<br>01:14:12,480 –&gt; 01:14:13,920<br>This is pure genius.</p>
<p>1552<br>01:14:15,239 –&gt; 01:14:16,359<br>It’s called TabDB.</p>
<p>1553<br>01:14:17,600 –&gt; 01:14:19,600<br>So it’s a relational database system</p>
<p>1554<br>01:14:19,600 –&gt; 01:14:23,000<br>where they store the contents of your database</p>
<p>1555<br>01:14:23,000 –&gt; 01:14:27,440<br>in the titles of your tabs in your web browser.</p>
<p>1556<br>01:14:27,440 –&gt; 01:14:28,880<br>So the way the guy did this was,</p>
<p>1557<br>01:14:28,880 –&gt; 01:14:30,880<br>he took SQLite C code,</p>
<p>1558<br>01:14:30,880 –&gt; 01:14:32,239<br>ran it through M-Scriptin,</p>
<p>1559<br>01:14:32,239 –&gt; 01:14:35,279<br>which allows you to convert C code into JavaScript.</p>
<p>1560<br>01:14:35,279 –&gt; 01:14:37,600<br>So now SQLite is running in JavaScript</p>
<p>1561<br>01:14:37,600 –&gt; 01:14:39,920<br>in your web browser, in your web page,</p>
<p>1562<br>01:14:39,920 –&gt; 01:14:41,319<br>and then when it wants to do right,</p>
<p>1563<br>01:14:41,319 –&gt; 01:14:43,720<br>it splits up your database file,</p>
<p>1564<br>01:14:43,720 –&gt; 01:14:47,480<br>it then writes it into tabs in your web browser.</p>
<p>1565<br>01:14:48,480 –&gt; 01:14:50,159<br>And you can run SQL, it’s amazing.</p>
<p>1566<br>01:14:51,199 –&gt; 01:14:51,960<br>So,</p>
<p>1567<br>01:14:54,960 –&gt; 01:14:55,960<br>ah, sorry.</p>
<p>1568<br>01:14:59,319 –&gt; 01:15:00,159<br>Mm.</p>
<p>1569<br>01:15:10,560 –&gt; 01:15:11,640<br>All right, so we gotta make,</p>
<p>1570<br>01:15:12,840 –&gt; 01:15:15,760<br>it makes some tabs, right?</p>
<p>1571<br>01:15:15,760 –&gt; 01:15:18,440<br>So we’ll call CrateStabit, right?</p>
<p>1572<br>01:15:18,440 –&gt; 01:15:20,760<br>Then now you see the tabs have been renamed,</p>
<p>1573<br>01:15:20,760 –&gt; 01:15:22,600<br>and then I can run a select statement,</p>
<p>1574<br>01:15:23,680 –&gt; 01:15:24,440<br>and I get results back.</p>
<p>1575<br>01:15:24,440 –&gt; 01:15:26,880<br>I don’t know where the results end up,</p>
<p>1576<br>01:15:26,880 –&gt; 01:15:28,560<br>but it ran, right?</p>
<p>1577<br>01:15:28,560 –&gt; 01:15:31,800<br>So if I add more tabs, I get more data.</p>
<p>1578<br>01:15:31,800 –&gt; 01:15:32,960<br>Oh, I know how to do much to insert.</p>
<p>1579<br>01:15:32,960 –&gt; 01:15:34,920<br>That’s why I got to do inserts, inserts.</p>
<p>1580<br>01:15:38,920 –&gt; 01:15:39,760<br>Yep.</p>
<p>1581<br>01:15:41,320 –&gt; 01:15:42,440<br>I can better resolve that.</p>
<p>1582<br>01:15:42,440 –&gt; 01:15:46,400<br>And that’s stored entirely in the tabs titles.</p>
<p>1583<br>01:15:46,400 –&gt; 01:15:48,640<br>Genius, I am very, very jealous of this.</p>
<p>1584<br>01:15:50,520 –&gt; 01:15:53,240<br>I, I don’t know what my joke database is,</p>
<p>1585<br>01:15:53,240 –&gt; 01:15:56,160<br>I gotta think of one, but this is very hard to beat this.</p>
<p>1586<br>01:15:56,160 –&gt; 01:15:57,000<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1587<br>01:15:58,000 –&gt; 01:16:01,119<br>If you click on a tab, I think you just get,</p>
<p>1588<br>01:16:02,079 –&gt; 01:16:06,600<br>yeah, but if you delete a tab, right?</p>
<p>1589<br>01:16:10,119 –&gt; 01:16:10,960<br>Oh, so got it.</p>
<p>1590<br>01:16:16,960 –&gt; 01:16:17,800<br>Delete the first one.</p>
<p>1591<br>01:16:23,359 –&gt; 01:16:24,960<br>Oh, you know what it is?</p>
<p>1592<br>01:16:24,960 –&gt; 01:16:28,119<br>It’s like the data is so small, actually, I don’t.</p>
<p>1593<br>01:16:31,000 –&gt; 01:16:32,439<br>It’s still in memory.</p>
<p>1594<br>01:16:32,439 –&gt; 01:16:33,480<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1595<br>01:16:33,480 –&gt; 01:16:36,279<br>Anyway, all right, that’s a fun one, tab DB.</p>
<p>1596<br>01:16:36,279 –&gt; 01:16:38,039<br>We tried to get the guy to come give a talk with us,</p>
<p>1597<br>01:16:38,039 –&gt; 01:16:39,960<br>and then I was gonna like try to promote it</p>
<p>1598<br>01:16:39,960 –&gt; 01:16:42,840<br>as like a distinguished lecturer in the department</p>
<p>1599<br>01:16:42,840 –&gt; 01:16:45,159<br>to say that there’s the groundbreaking idea</p>
<p>1600<br>01:16:45,159 –&gt; 01:16:46,880<br>we can just do this.</p>
<p>1601<br>01:16:46,880 –&gt; 01:16:49,359<br>All right, so quickly, quickly, quickly.</p>
<p>1602<br>01:16:49,359 –&gt; 01:16:50,640<br>So, collider marks.</p>
<p>1603<br>01:16:51,600 –&gt; 01:16:53,000<br>Where did the name bus stop come from?</p>
<p>1604<br>01:16:53,000 –&gt; 01:16:56,560<br>So, I have this, I really blog on it</p>
<p>1605<br>01:16:56,560 –&gt; 01:16:58,079<br>when the best name of the database system is,</p>
<p>1606<br>01:16:58,079 –&gt; 01:17:00,479<br>you pick two random ones syllable words,</p>
<p>1607<br>01:17:00,479 –&gt; 01:17:02,239<br>you stick them together, and that makes your,</p>
<p>1608<br>01:17:02,239 –&gt; 01:17:04,319<br>makes your database name to be guaranteed unique</p>
<p>1609<br>01:17:04,319 –&gt; 01:17:05,960<br>for like, you know, search engines and stuff.</p>
<p>1610<br>01:17:05,960 –&gt; 01:17:10,000<br>Like post-cress, post-cress, click house, grid gain.</p>
<p>1611<br>01:17:10,000 –&gt; 01:17:11,560<br>Like you search those words and it’s guaranteed</p>
<p>1612<br>01:17:11,560 –&gt; 01:17:13,039<br>to be your data system.</p>
<p>1613<br>01:17:13,039 –&gt; 01:17:15,960<br>So one of my PhD students, he wrote a script</p>
<p>1614<br>01:17:15,960 –&gt; 01:17:18,640<br>where every morning on Slack would take two random words</p>
<p>1615<br>01:17:18,640 –&gt; 01:17:20,600<br>and put them together and post that on Slack.</p>
<p>1616<br>01:17:20,600 –&gt; 01:17:22,800<br>We were trying to figure out which one you would wanna use.</p>
<p>1617<br>01:17:22,800 –&gt; 01:17:24,119<br>So they were screwing me the first time</p>
<p>1618<br>01:17:24,119 –&gt; 01:17:26,079<br>because the first thing to spit out was poop dish.</p>
<p>1619<br>01:17:26,079 –&gt; 01:17:29,320<br>But then the very next day, the real one</p>
<p>1620<br>01:17:29,320 –&gt; 01:17:31,320<br>actually pointed to spit out was bus tub.</p>
<p>1621<br>01:17:31,320 –&gt; 01:17:32,720<br>We just thought it was hilarious, we did that.</p>
<p>1622<br>01:17:32,720 –&gt; 01:17:34,239<br>So we hired someone to draw logo.</p>
<p>1623<br>01:17:34,239 –&gt; 01:17:36,039<br>So that’s where it came from.</p>
<p>1624<br>01:17:36,039 –&gt; 01:17:37,680<br>Why is relational model superior?</p>
<p>1625<br>01:17:37,680 –&gt; 01:17:39,279<br>I think I’ve already said this a couple of times,</p>
<p>1626<br>01:17:39,279 –&gt; 01:17:42,640<br>even today, but like, the relational model is,</p>
<p>1627<br>01:17:42,640 –&gt; 01:17:45,119<br>it’s like the foundation for databases.</p>
<p>1628<br>01:17:45,119 –&gt; 01:17:47,800<br>Like, you know, no one’s gonna invent a new arithmetic,</p>
<p>1629<br>01:17:47,800 –&gt; 01:17:48,680<br>like one plus one equals two.</p>
<p>1630<br>01:17:48,680 –&gt; 01:17:49,960<br>No one’s gonna reinvent that.</p>
<p>1631<br>01:17:49,960 –&gt; 01:17:51,720<br>The relational model can be used to model</p>
<p>1632<br>01:17:51,720 –&gt; 01:17:55,560<br>any possible type of application or data set,</p>
<p>1633<br>01:17:55,560 –&gt; 01:18:00,560<br>whether it’s arrays, lists or, you know, JSON stuff.</p>
<p>1634<br>01:18:01,039 –&gt; 01:18:02,400<br>And although that goes against</p>
<p>1635<br>01:18:02,400 –&gt; 01:18:05,360<br>with the original idea of what Ted Cod had in the 1970s,</p>
<p>1636<br>01:18:05,360 –&gt; 01:18:06,360<br>but what relational model was,</p>
<p>1637<br>01:18:06,360 –&gt; 01:18:08,680<br>because he had no lists, he had no documents.</p>
<p>1638<br>01:18:08,680 –&gt; 01:18:10,440<br>But over time, the relational model has expanded</p>
<p>1639<br>01:18:10,440 –&gt; 01:18:12,560<br>to adapt to changes in how people program,</p>
<p>1640<br>01:18:13,600 –&gt; 01:18:15,640<br>where today, it can support everything.</p>
<p>1641<br>01:18:16,640 –&gt; 01:18:17,680<br>The next question he had was,</p>
<p>1642<br>01:18:17,680 –&gt; 01:18:18,920<br>why did all the tech companies,</p>
<p>1643<br>01:18:18,920 –&gt; 01:18:21,680<br>why did tech companies support a lot of multidated systems?</p>
<p>1644<br>01:18:21,720 –&gt; 01:18:23,600<br>This is money, right?</p>
<p>1645<br>01:18:25,720 –&gt; 01:18:26,680<br>Plain and simple.</p>
<p>1646<br>01:18:28,800 –&gt; 01:18:29,640<br>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>1647<br>01:18:30,840 –&gt; 01:18:34,000<br>All right, so again, hopefully,</p>
<p>1648<br>01:18:35,800 –&gt; 01:18:37,240<br>through the last day of class,</p>
<p>1649<br>01:18:37,240 –&gt; 01:18:38,119<br>through that, you’ve been here with us</p>
<p>1650<br>01:18:38,119 –&gt; 01:18:39,960<br>for both the entire semester,</p>
<p>1651<br>01:18:39,960 –&gt; 01:18:41,600<br>you now realize that databases are awesome.</p>
<p>1652<br>01:18:41,600 –&gt; 01:18:42,720<br>They’re super important.</p>
<p>1653<br>01:18:42,720 –&gt; 01:18:44,280<br>There’s still a lot of activity in this space.</p>
<p>1654<br>01:18:44,280 –&gt; 01:18:45,400<br>There’s still a lot of money.</p>
<p>1655<br>01:18:45,400 –&gt; 01:18:47,880<br>We barely touched what all the different things</p>
<p>1656<br>01:18:47,880 –&gt; 01:18:48,720<br>you could actually do.</p>
<p>1657<br>01:18:48,720 –&gt; 01:18:50,600<br>I brought up M-Merry Davises today.</p>
<p>1658<br>01:18:50,600 –&gt; 01:18:51,600<br>That’s the first time we really talked about that.</p>
<p>1659<br>01:18:51,600 –&gt; 01:18:53,320<br>That’s a whole another category of databases</p>
<p>1660<br>01:18:54,320 –&gt; 01:18:55,520<br>that are super fascinating.</p>
<p>1661<br>01:18:55,520 –&gt; 01:18:57,880<br>And there’s embedded devices and large scale systems.</p>
<p>1662<br>01:18:57,880 –&gt; 01:18:59,079<br>So a bunch of these things,</p>
<p>1663<br>01:18:59,079 –&gt; 01:19:01,680<br>like there’s, the core ideas we talked about,</p>
<p>1664<br>01:19:01,680 –&gt; 01:19:03,480<br>even though we described it mostly</p>
<p>1665<br>01:19:03,480 –&gt; 01:19:05,079<br>in a single-node context,</p>
<p>1666<br>01:19:05,079 –&gt; 01:19:07,079<br>and again, it’s applicable everywhere.</p>
<p>1667<br>01:19:07,079 –&gt; 01:19:08,600<br>So again, hopefully going forward</p>
<p>1668<br>01:19:08,600 –&gt; 01:19:09,880<br>to rest of your career,</p>
<p>1669<br>01:19:09,880 –&gt; 01:19:11,440<br>no matter whether you’re actually building</p>
<p>1670<br>01:19:11,440 –&gt; 01:19:12,720<br>internals of a data system or not,</p>
<p>1671<br>01:19:12,720 –&gt; 01:19:14,000<br>you’ll understand what’s actually going on</p>
<p>1672<br>01:19:14,000 –&gt; 01:19:15,039<br>when you run a query.</p>
<p>1673<br>01:19:15,039 –&gt; 01:19:17,240<br>And so when there’ll be performance problems,</p>
<p>1674<br>01:19:17,240 –&gt; 01:19:20,079<br>at least now you can understand what’s going on</p>
<p>1675<br>01:19:20,479 –&gt; 01:19:21,399<br>and decide is it something</p>
<p>1676<br>01:19:21,399 –&gt; 01:19:23,039<br>because we’re using the data system wrong</p>
<p>1677<br>01:19:23,039 –&gt; 01:19:25,159<br>or it’s because the data system</p>
<p>1678<br>01:19:25,159 –&gt; 01:19:28,920<br>is just not implemented correctly or good enough.</p>
<p>1679<br>01:19:28,920 –&gt; 01:19:30,720<br>And this is going to allow you to make better decisions</p>
<p>1680<br>01:19:30,720 –&gt; 01:19:33,600<br>throughout your life about what kind of system you should use.</p>
<p>1681<br>01:19:33,600 –&gt; 01:19:35,000<br>Goes back to the thing you was asking me before.</p>
<p>1682<br>01:19:35,000 –&gt; 01:19:37,519<br>Why would anybody want to use one of these brand new databases</p>
<p>1683<br>01:19:37,519 –&gt; 01:19:39,000<br>or like should you use them</p>
<p>1684<br>01:19:39,000 –&gt; 01:19:41,680<br>if it’s a mission critical application?</p>
<p>1685<br>01:19:41,680 –&gt; 01:19:43,159<br>So now you can go look at the documentation,</p>
<p>1686<br>01:19:43,159 –&gt; 01:19:44,600<br>understand what claims a data system</p>
<p>1687<br>01:19:44,600 –&gt; 01:19:46,840<br>is actually making to understand</p>
<p>1688<br>01:19:46,840 –&gt; 01:19:49,079<br>what are the things that could be a problem later on.</p>
<p>1689<br>01:19:49,079 –&gt; 01:19:50,439<br>Because the first five minutes, sure, yeah,</p>
<p>1690<br>01:19:50,439 –&gt; 01:19:53,640<br>the query might run fast as a MongoDB did,</p>
<p>1691<br>01:19:53,640 –&gt; 01:19:57,319<br>but like as things scale or as you do more complex operations</p>
<p>1692<br>01:19:57,319 –&gt; 01:19:59,439<br>on it, you could have a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>1693<br>01:20:00,439 –&gt; 01:20:01,279<br>Okay?</p>
<p>1694<br>01:20:02,159 –&gt; 01:20:03,640<br>All right, so before we go,</p>
<p>1695<br>01:20:05,960 –&gt; 01:20:09,760<br>before we go, we just got noticed from the pre-bust</p>
<p>1696<br>01:20:11,159 –&gt; 01:20:14,239<br>from the university that the voting is in</p>
<p>1697<br>01:20:14,239 –&gt; 01:20:19,239<br>and DJ 2PO has been voted the most dank course DJ</p>
<p>1698<br>01:20:19,960 –&gt; 01:20:21,159<br>at all of Carnegie Mellon.</p>
<p>1699<br>01:20:21,159 –&gt; 01:20:24,479<br>So, yeah, it’s like right here.</p>
<p>1700<br>01:20:24,479 –&gt; 01:20:26,039<br>Oh, there you go.</p>
<p>1701<br>01:20:26,039 –&gt; 01:20:26,880<br>There you go.</p>
<p>1702<br>01:20:26,880 –&gt; 01:20:29,760<br>Look, you grab this, it’s yours.</p>
<p>1703<br>01:20:29,760 –&gt; 01:20:30,599<br>You’re like this.</p>
<p>1704<br>01:20:31,599 –&gt; 01:20:32,439<br>Got it?</p>
<p>1705<br>01:20:32,439 –&gt; 01:20:33,439<br>Okay, congratulations.</p>
<p>1706<br>01:20:33,439 –&gt; 01:20:38,519<br>All right, and again, for those who came late,</p>
<p>1707<br>01:20:38,519 –&gt; 01:20:41,239<br>DJ 2PO’s agent sent over photos.</p>
<p>1708<br>01:20:41,239 –&gt; 01:20:44,800<br>So he’s signing autographs right after class, okay?</p>
<p>1709<br>01:20:44,800 –&gt; 01:20:46,800<br>All right, go look, rest your classes.</p>
<p>1710<br>01:20:46,800 –&gt; 01:20:48,239<br>Take care, hit it.</p>
<p>1711<br>01:20:48,239 –&gt; 01:20:49,239<br>I’m gonna go.</p>
<p>1712<br>01:20:49,239 –&gt; 01:20:50,239<br>I’m gonna go.</p>
<p>1713<br>01:20:50,239 –&gt; 01:20:51,239<br>I’m gonna go.</p>
