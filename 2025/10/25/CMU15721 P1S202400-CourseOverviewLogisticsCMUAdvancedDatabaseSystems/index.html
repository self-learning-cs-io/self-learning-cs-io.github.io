                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,000<br>Caniki Mellon University’s advanced database systems courses</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,000<br>filming in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,000 –&gt; 00:00:17,000<br>Guys, like I said, I can’t be there for the first week of classes.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,000 –&gt; 00:00:22,000<br>Not here in California because somebody needed my help</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,000 –&gt; 00:00:25,000<br>and had to come and ask for you to do something weird out here</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,000 –&gt; 00:00:28,000<br>and so that’s why I’m not in Pittsburgh for the first week.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,000 –&gt; 00:00:33,000<br>But it’s always something, oh, you know, like, O’Annie knows how to deal with the</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:33,000 –&gt; 00:00:36,000<br>****, go have him help us out or like, any of those amount of data</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:36,000 –&gt; 00:00:38,000<br>we do, we go have help us.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:38,000 –&gt; 00:00:41,000<br>But it is what it is.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:41,000 –&gt; 00:00:48,000<br>So right now I’m out here in parking lot with like a hundred drifters</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:48,000 –&gt; 00:00:50,000<br>and hanging out.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:50,000 –&gt; 00:00:53,000<br>But I figured now’s the time to go through the class.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:53,000 –&gt; 00:00:54,000<br>Let’s plath through this.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:55,000 –&gt; 00:00:59,000<br>So this lecture is not really going to be about the course material.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:59,000 –&gt; 00:01:02,000<br>It’s really about what the course was going to be about.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:02,000 –&gt; 00:01:06,000<br>And then the logistics of like how the project is going to work out.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:06,000 –&gt; 00:01:10,000<br>Because that’s going to be a big component about 15, 17, 21 this semester.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:10,000 –&gt; 00:01:13,000<br>I don’t know what to spend time talking about that.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:13,000 –&gt; 00:01:19,000<br>It’s just be different than the never thing, you know, the previous incarnations of the course.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:19,000 –&gt; 00:01:23,000<br>So I say it’s always every semester or what should you take this course.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:23,000 –&gt; 00:01:29,000<br>And the straight answer is basically that databases are still in demand.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:29,000 –&gt; 00:01:34,000<br>They’re super complicated to build, super complicated to maintain and optimize.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:34,000 –&gt; 00:01:38,000<br>And there’s a lot of really interesting console problems in the end of the process.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:38,000 –&gt; 00:01:41,000<br>I’m running query and query and analytics.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:41,000 –&gt; 00:01:47,000<br>So this course is going to prepare you for, you know, career or research</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:47,000 –&gt; 00:01:50,000<br>into data management systems.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:51,000 –&gt; 00:01:57,000<br>And the great thing about it is even if you don’t want to go down that path of like doing database systems work.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:57,000 –&gt; 00:02:03,000<br>The things you’re going to learn about, learn about in this semester are going to be valuable throughout the rest of your life.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:03,000 –&gt; 00:02:08,000<br>So, you know, if you can write code and database management system, you can write code and pretty much anything else.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:08,000 –&gt; 00:02:10,000<br>Anything else that’s going to care about performance.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:10,000 –&gt; 00:02:17,000<br>If you really need to understand what data is, what the workload is, and how to take full advantage of hardware.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:18,000 –&gt; 00:02:22,000<br>And the way I think about it is also, too, is like, people pay you a lot of money for it.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:22,000 –&gt; 00:02:26,000<br>Part of the reason why I’m at your in California to deal with all that best.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:26,000 –&gt; 00:02:35,000<br>And if you don’t believe me, here’s a quick overview of some of the students have taken 721 for the last five, six years or so.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:35,000 –&gt; 00:02:38,000<br>And these are just the ones I can quickly remember off top of my head.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:38,000 –&gt; 00:02:43,000<br>And they all end up at awesome places getting paid a lot of money to work on database systems.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:44,000 –&gt; 00:02:50,000<br>So hopefully, you know, if you come over this this semester, you know, we’ll put your photo up next year.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:50,000 –&gt; 00:02:57,000<br>So, and Databricks is surprisingly hired a lot of the best students were recently.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:57,000 –&gt; 00:03:01,000<br>But everyone goes everywhere, which is always good.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:01,000 –&gt; 00:03:11,000<br>So this course is really about the understanding and learning about the modern practices of how people build a data management system.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:11,000 –&gt; 00:03:18,000<br>And the techniques and the methods we’re going to use to do systems programming to develop about these ideas.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:18,000 –&gt; 00:03:22,000<br>And this semester is going to talk about analytical workloads.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:22,000 –&gt; 00:03:26,000<br>So we’re not going to really talk about transactions or doing right-heavy workloads.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:26,000 –&gt; 00:03:36,000<br>It’s really about how do I have a large data sets and running queries on them quickly to extract new information and new knowledge from the databases or from that data.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:36,000 –&gt; 00:03:44,000<br>And so the goal is in addition to understanding all the methods and techniques of how people build a modern analytical database system.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:44,000 –&gt; 00:03:51,000<br>You’ll learn how to write good code, that’s how to for instance correct, how to write documentation and testing plans for that code.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:51,000 –&gt; 00:04:02,000<br>Because it’s not just right, hey, here’s our project we’re done. When I have full-fledged testing methods and ways to ensure that things are operating correctly or things are producing correct results.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:02,000 –&gt; 00:04:07,000<br>There’ll be a little bit of code reviews during the semester and then obviously working on a large code base.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:07,000 –&gt; 00:04:17,000<br>Maybe not entirely true for these projects in the beginning, but since we’re doing semester-long projects this year, your code base is going to get quite large by the end.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:17,000 –&gt; 00:04:27,000<br>So we’re really focusing here on student-based topics. We’re not going to be rehashing stuff that we covered in the intro class or going through the textbook.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:27,000 –&gt; 00:04:37,000<br>It’s really about looking at the latest research paper and the latest literature on building a modern system and then seeing how we can apply that to our…</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:37,000 –&gt; 00:04:44,000<br>So at its core, the overarching model of the database system will be trying to build a developed…</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:44,000 –&gt; 00:04:49,000<br>Well, at high level look a lot like the stuff we’ve covered in the intro class, it’s got a classic database system.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:49,000 –&gt; 00:04:57,000<br>But it’s really about how do we then infuse these ideas and these methods that have been developed for the last 10 years or so to accelerate query execution?</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:58,000 –&gt; 00:05:07,000<br>So on that topic, these are the topics or these are the main ideas or sections we’re going to cover throughout the semester.</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:07,000 –&gt; 00:05:16,000<br>So first we’re going to talk about what the data actually should look like, the data formats, how we’re doing coding compression in such a way that they will speed up data access.</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:17,000 –&gt; 00:05:24,000<br>But also reduce the footprint of radiators is also talking about different methods to accelerate query processing.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:24,000 –&gt; 00:05:34,000<br>So doing vectorized query execution or code generation query compilation, how to take a query plan, physical query plan and execute it most efficiently on the data.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:34,000 –&gt; 00:05:46,000<br>Then we’ll look at a lot of larger view of the system, how we handle scheduling within a single query itself and over across the entire workload.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:46,000 –&gt; 00:05:56,000<br>How do we do… how to run general and run an algorithm sufficiently, how do we handle network protocols between the nodes and between the nodes and the client.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:57,000 –&gt; 00:06:05,000<br>We spend a lot of time talking about query optimization because again, it doesn’t matter how fast we do our database system, if our query plan is sub optimal, we’ll just garbage.</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:05,000 –&gt; 00:06:10,000<br>Then all the stuff we’re going to do before then doesn’t actually matter. It’s wasted time.</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:10,000 –&gt; 00:06:20,000<br>And then we’re going to spend a significant third of the lecture, a quarter of the lecture, a semester talking about or looking at real implementations of data systems.</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:21,000 –&gt; 00:06:33,000<br>And this by reading the papers from the major players in industry and startups and sort of seeing how we can then apply or how they’re applying all the techniques that we’ve been discussing in their particular systems.</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:33,000 –&gt; 00:06:43,000<br>And essentially form a taxonomy, it’ll say, okay, a system can do xyz and we then see how like snowflake does things or yellow brick does things.</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:43,000 –&gt; 00:06:46,000<br>And so we’ll cover that throughout the entire semester.</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:47,000 –&gt; 00:06:56,000<br>So for this course, I’m assuming you are already taking the intercourse at CMU, 15445, 645 or something equipment in your undergraduate background.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:56,000 –&gt; 00:07:00,000<br>This is a graduate level course on modern data systems.</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:00,000 –&gt; 00:07:09,000<br>We’re talk about the classic algorithms, like how to do a hash join, but what’s the way how to do it in a modern setting on today’s hardware.</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:10,000 –&gt; 00:07:17,000<br>So there’s a bunch of things I’m not going to go over as background, a relational algebra, storage models, basic memory management, and so forth.</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:17,000 –&gt; 00:07:29,000<br>Like all those things we’re not going to discuss, I’m going to assume you already know them and it’s really about, okay, how do you do a high performance modern parallel hash join, right, as cash contracts or so forth.</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:29,000 –&gt; 00:07:35,000<br>So that’s the flavor for the discussion throughout the semester.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:35,000 –&gt; 00:07:39,000<br>The course policies and schedule, please always refer to the course webpage.</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:39,000 –&gt; 00:07:51,000<br>I’ve posted that this week and these we update a little bit with some of the readings later this semester will get changed a little bit, but for at least the first couple of weeks, the schedule is pretty set.</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:51,000 –&gt; 00:07:56,000<br>And then the we’ll talk about what’s required for you are deliverables throughout the semester.</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:56,000 –&gt; 00:08:03,000<br>But again, I’ll just say as we go along, obviously don’t don’t plagiarize, don’t try to steal things, don’t cheat.</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:03,000 –&gt; 00:08:12,000<br>And if you’re not sure, please, please come talk to me, if we do catch you cheating in some kind of way, which again for a graduate level course, this should not be an issue, then we hope they’re referred you to Warner Hall.</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:12,000 –&gt; 00:08:15,000<br>And that’s not that’s not good for anybody.</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:15,000 –&gt; 00:08:23,000<br>I’m going to have my office hours twice a week, immediately after class, 30 or 430 in my office and then I floor and gates.</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:23,000 –&gt; 00:08:29,000<br>If there’s this is this time is not convenient for you, send me an email and then we can try to figure out something else.</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:30,000 –&gt; 00:08:39,000<br>So, you know, I’ll say this every semester, what can we talk about when you come to office hours with me while we talk about, you know, your status on the project, how that’s going.</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:39,000 –&gt; 00:08:46,000<br>If you have questions about the papers, I want to know more about the particular topic that go beyond the things we discussed in class, happy to talk about those things.</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:46,000 –&gt; 00:08:51,000<br>A lot of you going to want to get data based jobs and the semester, so we’re talking about how we can facilitate that.</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:51,000 –&gt; 00:08:57,000<br>And like I said, like I know how to handle the police, until so extent.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:57,000 –&gt; 00:09:02,000<br>Obviously, if you’re, you try to, if you try to run from that, I can’t help with that.</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:02,000 –&gt; 00:09:09,000<br>But whatever, again, if you’re going to involve in databases, you’re going to be end up in a parking lot teaching classes at some point or doing something.</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:09,000 –&gt; 00:09:14,000<br>So by all means, talk to me before we have problems later on.</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:14,000 –&gt; 00:09:20,000<br>We have one teaching assistant this semester, that’s my number one PGA student, William Zhang.</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:20,000 –&gt; 00:09:32,000<br>So he’s actually seeing me undergrad. He graduated 4.0. He actually took this class when he was a sophomore and crushed it in the way that’s suspiciously good for a sophomore.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:32,000 –&gt; 00:09:39,000<br>But he’s legit. So we asked him to stick around and he’s continued with his PhD after spending a little time at single store.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:39,000 –&gt; 00:09:56,000<br>He’s a dataless company and he’s working with us now. He’s fantastic. So he’s the TA for, as a good further along the projects, he might, he might help me to come into us when we help each group with their implementations.</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:56,000 –&gt; 00:10:06,000<br>He’s Canadian. You know, it’s, it’s fine. He’s been good to us. So we have, we have, we have, should we know issues with that for anybody in the course?</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:06,000 –&gt; 00:10:10,000<br>If you have a problem with this, let me know.</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:10,000 –&gt; 00:10:19,000<br>All right, all the discussion for the data operations, of course, and just as we go along in the projects, you know, we want to do the piata.</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:19,000 –&gt; 00:10:23,000<br>If you have a technical question about the projects or anything, every again, post everything in piata.</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:23,000 –&gt; 00:10:35,000<br>So we can, we can all continue to contribute as a class. If any personal questions or anything that’s not related to project, any logistical things, send those emails directly to me.</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:36,000 –&gt; 00:10:46,000<br>All right, so here’s the breakdown for the grade of the semester. So there’s going to be four parts. And as you can see at the bottom, the semester long project, that’s obviously the bulk of the grade.</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:46,000 –&gt; 00:10:56,000<br>And so if your PGA student is course counts for, I think the software systems are elected. And this is the reason why it’s going to be, it’s, we’re heavily focused on the, in the projects.</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:56,000 –&gt; 00:11:03,000<br>So I go, I go through each of these one, one by one, but I spend most of my time at the end talking about the semester long project.</p>
<p>101<br>00:11:04,000 –&gt; 00:11:13,000<br>So for every class, except when the groups are presenting the project updates and so forth, there’ll be a assigned reading.</p>
<p>102<br>00:11:13,000 –&gt; 00:11:22,000<br>So in the, if you look at the schedule, there’ll be one paper per class that has this crown next to it, the icon indicate that it’s the primary reading.</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:22,000 –&gt; 00:11:31,000<br>So this is the one that you’re responsible for. If you want to go beyond the topics in the course, like if it’s related to your project or just, you’re just curious, the other readings are considered optional.</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:31,000 –&gt; 00:11:51,000<br>And on some of them, I’ll cover in the lecture, but like the assigned readings, the main one that’s sort of like the canonical provides the sort of canonical description of the technique or trying to cover the most important version of the technique trying to cover.</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:52,000 –&gt; 00:11:59,000<br>So for every, all these primary readings before class, you have to submit a synopsis through a Google form at the URL there.</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:59,000 –&gt; 00:12:06,000<br>And the idea is here, you just, so you’d read the paper and then summarize what the, the paper’s actually trying to tell us about.</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:06,000 –&gt; 00:12:14,000<br>What method is it trying to show us? And by writing it down, it forces you to really think about, okay, do I really understand what the, what the paper’s trying to say.</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:14,000 –&gt; 00:12:22,000<br>So the synopsis is not meant to be like a really long book report. It’s really just be like a quick summary of what the paper, the key parts of the paper is.</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:22,000 –&gt; 00:12:34,000<br>So you have the first part of like three sentences, both main idea, what context they’re trying to describe this particular method, and what are the key findings or takeaways from the paper.</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:34,000 –&gt; 00:12:39,000<br>And then like a one sentence description of like what system they’re going to use to enter by wishing.</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:39,000 –&gt; 00:12:46,000<br>In some cases, it’s obvious because it’s like, oh, the paper’s from snowflake. So they’re talking about their everything in context of snowflake.</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:46,000 –&gt; 00:12:55,000<br>Or maybe like they hacked up postgres or not DBE and put it on that. So like, just understanding what was being modified, what was being evaluated, that would be super useful.</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:55,000 –&gt; 00:13:01,000<br>And then the last one is describing what workloads or benchmarks they’re using in their valuation to test their particular ideas or method.</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:01,000 –&gt; 00:13:10,000<br>And the reason why this last one is important because when it comes time to start testing and evaluating your projects, you know, I don’t want you to come and say, hey, what workloads should it use.</p>
<p>115<br>00:13:10,000 –&gt; 00:13:17,000<br>You should know because you’re going to see a bunch of these things over and over again throughout the entire semester in these papers.</p>
<p>116<br>00:13:17,000 –&gt; 00:13:21,000<br>So again, it’s the half to be submitted before the class starts.</p>
<p>117<br>00:13:21,000 –&gt; 00:13:28,000<br>And everyone is granted three, a lot of three skip workloads, skip three workloads during the</p>
<p>118<br>00:13:28,000 –&gt; 00:13:30,000<br>the</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:30,000 –&gt; 00:13:32,000<br>doing the</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:32,000 –&gt; 00:13:34,000<br>next semester.</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:34,000 –&gt; 00:13:40,000<br>Okay.</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:40,000 –&gt; 00:13:45,000<br>So again, for these, again, the whole point is for you to learn from, you know,</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:45,000 –&gt; 00:13:51,000<br>learn something from the papers. So it doesn’t help you if you just go take the paper and dump it into chat GBT and that’s what it’s not.</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:51,000 –&gt; 00:13:59,000<br>You don’t get a thing out about it. So please don’t do that. If there’s some reason these papers that you find on the internet, just don’t copy them in.</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:59,000 –&gt; 00:14:06,000<br>Don’t copy from your fellow classmates. Again, we will, we will have to go turn everybody into one all.</p>
<p>126<br>00:14:06,000 –&gt; 00:14:10,000<br>If you get caught doing this, so don’t be stupid.</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:10,000 –&gt; 00:14:11,000<br>All right.</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:11,000 –&gt; 00:14:20,000<br>In addition to the synopsis for every every every class is also going to be, each student is going to be required to write lecture notes.</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:20,000 –&gt; 00:14:31,000<br>Think of this as like a longer version of the synopsis, but also covering all the ideas and other papers we’re discussing in the class, which may not have included in the single paper assignment.</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:31,000 –&gt; 00:14:38,000<br>Right. So the idea is like you watch the lecture and summarize the slides and the key things that we’re talking about into.</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:38,000 –&gt; 00:14:42,000<br>And I have examples how it would be so like we’ll put everything on GitHub.</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:42,000 –&gt; 00:14:47,000<br>We’ll put everything on the course website. We’ll make these available to both current students in the class.</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:47,000 –&gt; 00:14:53,000<br>So it’ll help them on the final exam, but also in future future years and people outside see you.</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:53,000 –&gt; 00:15:00,000<br>So again, these notes should just be sort of limited to the things that we discuss in the slides.</p>
<p>135<br>00:15:00,000 –&gt; 00:15:05,000<br>Oftentimes students will ask questions and I’ll start saying crazy stuff.</p>
<p>136<br>00:15:05,000 –&gt; 00:15:12,000<br>That does not be included. Again, anything about the slides is sort of the key thing there.</p>
<p>137<br>00:15:12,000 –&gt; 00:15:17,000<br>So every student is going to be assigned to do this once per lecture.</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:17,000 –&gt; 00:15:21,000<br>Problem is that we have more students in the lecture. So I got to figure out how to handle that.</p>
<p>139<br>00:15:21,000 –&gt; 00:15:26,000<br>So right now there’s a minute, the administration spreadsheet. There’s an assigned lecture date with everybody’s Android.</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:26,000 –&gt; 00:15:31,000<br>That will be a, we got to figure out how to, how to load balance that accordingly.</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:31,000 –&gt; 00:15:36,000<br>I don’t care who does what. So if there’s a top, you really want to cover and you want to swap somebody else by all means do that.</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:36,000 –&gt; 00:15:41,000<br>You don’t need to ask me to, for mission knew that just go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:41,000 –&gt; 00:15:44,000<br>And for this one, you’re a lot of use jet dbt or whatever you want.</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:44,000 –&gt; 00:15:55,000<br>Because we don’t care because it’s really about like using as an assistive technology to help you flesh out the core ideas or things you want to capture in writing.</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:55,000 –&gt; 00:16:01,000<br>So by all means, like if you want to take the transcripts from the videos and put that into jet dbt and let it summarize it for you,</p>
<p>146<br>00:16:01,000 –&gt; 00:16:05,000<br>but then use it as the starting point to then flesh out further.</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:05,000 –&gt; 00:16:14,000<br>Go ahead and do it. And in the end, you’re ultimately responsible for what that lecture, what the lecture notes are going to say.</p>
<p>148<br>00:16:14,000 –&gt; 00:16:22,000<br>So chat gbt starts going off the chain and start saying things like, actually one year said embedded, I embedded like com store stuff, which is not true.</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:22,000 –&gt; 00:16:30,000<br>So if you have to start saying BS and you put that in there and turn those lecture notes, well now you didn’t, you didn’t, you didn’t that that.</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:30,000 –&gt; 00:16:36,000<br>And you read that for right. So obviously, again, be smart using the technology.</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:36,000 –&gt; 00:16:44,000<br>Alright, there’ll be a final exam that’ll be take home long form. I’ll give you out the questions at the last day of the class.</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:44,000 –&gt; 00:16:48,000<br>And then you’ll turn it in when we have the final exam final presentation during finals week.</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:48,000 –&gt; 00:16:52,000<br>And again, this is not meant to be.</p>
<p>154<br>00:16:52,000 –&gt; 00:16:57,000<br>It’s not going to say, you know, the question’s not going to be like, okay, what does this paper say about this particular thing?</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:57,000 –&gt; 00:17:12,000<br>The idea is to see whether you can synthesize a bunch of different ideas from the various materials to talk about in the semester and then put them in a new context work, a new theoretical system, and so on.</p>
<p>156<br>00:17:12,000 –&gt; 00:17:24,000<br>You can understand not just how individual ideas work, but how they all sort of fit together into a larger system, which is sort of the key thing that we want to focus on here.</p>
<p>157<br>00:17:24,000 –&gt; 00:17:29,000<br>Alright, so the big part of the semester is going to be the semester long project.</p>
<p>158<br>00:17:29,000 –&gt; 00:17:40,000<br>And the idea, the, you know, the high level idea what we want to do is we basically want to start building a, you know, a new database running system here at Carnegie Mellon, both myself and the other president of J. N. F. Patel.</p>
<p>159<br>00:17:40,000 –&gt; 00:17:51,000<br>And so the course is going to basically be the sort of starting point for fleshing out some of these components we need in this larger system.</p>
<p>160<br>00:17:51,000 –&gt; 00:18:00,000<br>And so one of the overarching themes we’re going to have for how we design things going forward is a data activity.</p>
<p>161<br>00:18:00,000 –&gt; 00:18:10,000<br>So not just the ideas like can the system automatically adjust a query wise running or throw us the self whites running based on the data that sees or different characteristics of the hardware.</p>
<p>162<br>00:18:10,000 –&gt; 00:18:13,000<br>And can we do that incrementally over time?</p>
<p>163<br>00:18:13,000 –&gt; 00:18:20,000<br>Again, I’ll explain what that is as we go far that long, but that’s the overarching theme is this is sort of in that direction.</p>
<p>164<br>00:18:20,000 –&gt; 00:18:23,000<br>We decided to do everything in rust the semester.</p>
<p>165<br>00:18:23,000 –&gt; 00:18:28,000<br>I, like I said, I did not, I did not know rust before the semester. And as I send the email to you guys.</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:28,000 –&gt; 00:18:34,000<br>I know a lot of you don’t as well. So we’re not going to teach you rust. We’ll just sort of pick it up as we go along.</p>
<p>167<br>00:18:34,000 –&gt; 00:18:37,000<br>We don’t know what we have a name for this system yet.</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:37,000 –&gt; 00:18:43,000<br>But you know, which is always one of the hardest things to do in career science.</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:44,000 –&gt; 00:18:52,000<br>So, but the idea is that we can take all these components to different projects, put them together and make a full-fledged system, maybe next semester in the fall or the summer.</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:52,000 –&gt; 00:19:01,000<br>So I have a way to kind of name systems, but it’s right now it’s, you know, it’s names should to be determined.</p>
<p>171<br>00:19:01,000 –&gt; 00:19:09,000<br>So the way we’re going to do this is that every group is very student is going to be assigned to a group and we have groups of three.</p>
<p>172<br>00:19:09,000 –&gt; 00:19:13,000<br>And then there’ll be five topics of components of this larger system, we’re end up building.</p>
<p>173<br>00:19:13,000 –&gt; 00:19:21,000<br>And the idea is that we have roughly 30 students, you do three groups of 10, sorry 10 groups of three.</p>
<p>174<br>00:19:21,000 –&gt; 00:19:26,000<br>And you would have two groups assigned to build the, the same component.</p>
<p>175<br>00:19:26,000 –&gt; 00:19:32,000<br>And so they’ll have to collaborate a little bit, make sure that they figure out what the specification of that component is.</p>
<p>176<br>00:19:32,000 –&gt; 00:19:38,000<br>Then they’re also going to compete with that, that I’m going to try to build a faster or better implementation than that.</p>
<p>177<br>00:19:38,000 –&gt; 00:19:48,000<br>At the end, we’ll have a vote decide who gets, you know, which component of the two, the same top of which implementation, the same component and the same topic is, is the winner.</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:48,000 –&gt; 00:19:54,000<br>And we’ll, you know, we’ll use that going forward in future research and future projects.</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:54,000 –&gt; 00:19:58,000<br>So everything I said here is true, except for the optimizer group and that’s why that’s different.</p>
<p>180<br>00:19:58,000 –&gt; 00:20:06,000<br>But the basic idea is because the query optimization is so hard and we only have a semester, it’s unlikely anybody’s going to build a query optimizer in a single semester.</p>
<p>181<br>00:20:06,000 –&gt; 00:20:11,000<br>So whereas the other components we could build a working part of that fairly quickly in a small group.</p>
<p>182<br>00:20:11,000 –&gt; 00:20:19,000<br>So the idea is that we will, the after the team, they’ll have to collaborate together more so than the others.</p>
<p>183<br>00:20:20,000 –&gt; 00:20:24,000<br>So there’s five, there’s five project areas, our project topics.</p>
<p>184<br>00:20:24,000 –&gt; 00:20:30,000<br>The first four here are the ones where again, they will have two groups and we’re trying to implement the same thing and compete against each other.</p>
<p>185<br>00:20:30,000 –&gt; 00:20:37,000<br>So the first is going to be a scheduler. This is the part, the system that figures out, here’s the queries I need to run.</p>
<p>186<br>00:20:37,000 –&gt; 00:20:40,000<br>How do I break them up and send them to different nodes?</p>
<p>187<br>00:20:40,000 –&gt; 00:20:48,000<br>And then as the queries are running, how do I keep feeding, or I say, as the queries are running, how do I keep feeding tasks to the nodes that keep them saturated in order to get the data?</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:48,000 –&gt; 00:20:50,000<br>You’ve saturated and it was busy.</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:50,000 –&gt; 00:20:58,000<br>The execution engine are the parts of the system that’s going to take those tasks for the query plans and actually start executing process and data.</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:58,000 –&gt; 00:21:04,000<br>To simplify things, we’re going to assume that the execution engine will be a single node.</p>
<p>191<br>00:21:04,000 –&gt; 00:21:12,000<br>The next component is the catalog service and this is going to be the internal database files and keep track of the database files in the schema.</p>
<p>192<br>00:21:12,000 –&gt; 00:21:23,000<br>And this will then be fed into the query optimizer and the scheduler to figure out, okay, here’s the data I have, here’s the tables I have and had a journey like the physical plans for those.</p>
<p>193<br>00:21:23,000 –&gt; 00:21:37,000<br>And the last one here will be the IO service, the thing that’s actually responsible for going out to disk or an object store, retrieving the blocks of data that are needed by the system and then distributing them to the various nodes that need it.</p>
<p>194<br>00:21:37,000 –&gt; 00:21:48,000<br>They can also maintain its own local, federal cache so that we don’t have to do expensive calls to the object store to read writing from local disk.</p>
<p>195<br>00:21:48,000 –&gt; 00:22:05,000<br>And it says the query optimizer for that piece, the idea is that SQL query shows up and then we want to use a combination of roll-based optimizations or heuristics and a call-space search to determine the best physical plan for that query.</p>
<p>196<br>00:22:05,000 –&gt; 00:22:10,000<br>We do have an additional prototype now that a student worked on last semester called OPD.</p>
<p>197<br>00:22:10,000 –&gt; 00:22:16,000<br>It’s a fork of data fusion, which we’ll explain that as we go along for the semester.</p>
<p>198<br>00:22:16,000 –&gt; 00:22:27,000<br>So it follows the data, data fusion internal format for query plans, but it doesn’t rely on them data fusion to do, you know, join, join ordering and other things.</p>
<p>199<br>00:22:27,000 –&gt; 00:22:34,000<br>So again, the way in query optimizer is super, super hard. We’re not going to get, you know, a telly, we’re not going to get too far in a single semester.</p>
<p>200<br>00:22:34,000 –&gt; 00:22:47,000<br>And so the idea is like instead of having two groups built over the new things for this part here, it makes sense for them to work collaboratively different parts of the system, different parts of the optimizer for working on a particular single code base.</p>
<p>201<br>00:22:48,000 –&gt; 00:22:57,000<br>So for all the other projects, we want to implement this on scratch. We’re okay with you taking heavy inspiration from open source things like data fusion.</p>
<p>202<br>00:22:57,000 –&gt; 00:23:05,000<br>That’s one thing we’re looking at, particular, another one, Bellox from Facebook, our meta for their execution engine. That’s the C++.</p>
<p>203<br>00:23:05,000 –&gt; 00:23:16,000<br>So we’re okay with you, you know, just looking these things, discussing them. If it’s open source and if we figure out how to bar this idea and put it to her.</p>
<p>204<br>00:23:16,000 –&gt; 00:23:28,000<br>So for this semester, it will be four projects, sorry, four milestones. So the first one coming up, we generate 31st will be the project proposal.</p>
<p>205<br>00:23:28,000 –&gt; 00:23:40,000<br>And then the next one is the second, then it’ll be two status updates once a month. And then at the end of the semester, whenever we’re assigned a final, a final day in May, then we’ll have the final presentation.</p>
<p>206<br>00:23:40,000 –&gt; 00:23:46,000<br>And then everyone will be required to do the code drop on GitHub to turn in the system.</p>
<p>207<br>00:23:46,000 –&gt; 00:23:53,000<br>But again, the idea here is that by having these incremental updates, and even in some classes at the end, we have extra time.</p>
<p>208<br>00:23:53,000 –&gt; 00:24:02,000<br>And then we’ll discuss how everyone’s, you know, the progress everyone’s doing on the projects and anything that is coming up, any problems and issues amongst, you know, amongst everyone.</p>
<p>209<br>00:24:02,000 –&gt; 00:24:09,000<br>And that way, like, it’s not like everyone disappears without any feedback and they show up at the end of May and be like, hey, you know, here’s my project, how did I do?</p>
<p>210<br>00:24:09,000 –&gt; 00:24:16,000<br>Like everyone’s going to know how, how everyone else is doing. And we sort of see how all these things sort of fit together.</p>
<p>211<br>00:24:16,000 –&gt; 00:24:23,000<br>So the first thing coming up on the 31st is in two weeks will be the project proposal. And this will have three parts.</p>
<p>212<br>00:24:23,000 –&gt; 00:24:32,000<br>It’ll have a plan, one or two pages of a markdown file describing how you’re going to actually implement the thing that the part of the system you’re working on.</p>
<p>213<br>00:24:32,000 –&gt; 00:24:37,000<br>And then you give a five minute presentation of the class and say, here’s the high level ideas of what we’re trying to do.</p>
<p>214<br>00:24:37,000 –&gt; 00:24:51,000<br>And a key thing which you want to describe is also not only how you’re going to build your thing and what ideas and what what libraries and so forth, you’re going to take advantage of, but actually how you’re going to test your implementation to see that it’s actually correct.</p>
<p>215<br>00:24:51,000 –&gt; 00:24:55,000<br>Make sure there’s no errors and problems that you go along.</p>
<p>216<br>00:24:55,000 –&gt; 00:25:04,000<br>In addition to the project proposal itself, you’re also going to turn in a specification proposal for what the API of your component is going to be.</p>
<p>217<br>00:25:04,000 –&gt; 00:25:14,000<br>So you sort of think of these five projects as all sort of microservices. And though it’s an internal API that is going to allow one project team to call your service to get whatever it needs.</p>
<p>218<br>00:25:14,000 –&gt; 00:25:21,000<br>So like if the execution engine team, the obviously need a physical plan.</p>
<p>219<br>00:25:21,000 –&gt; 00:25:31,000<br>So the query optimization team or the scheduled teams can have to give query plans in a format that the execution engine team can actually use.</p>
<p>220<br>00:25:31,000 –&gt; 00:25:35,000<br>So we want to be up front and figure out what the API is ahead of time.</p>
<p>221<br>00:25:35,000 –&gt; 00:25:39,000<br>So everyone knows how to talk to other parts, other parts of the system.</p>
<p>222<br>00:25:39,000 –&gt; 00:25:45,000<br>So the API should cover like when the commands or operations you’re going to expose what are the input and output and coding is going to be.</p>
<p>223<br>00:25:45,000 –&gt; 00:25:52,000<br>So I accept for the OS at query plans or like, you know, if it’s the I.O. service, what are the data blocks actually going to look like?</p>
<p>224<br>00:25:52,000 –&gt; 00:25:55,000<br>Is it going to be parquet format or something else? Right.</p>
<p>225<br>00:25:55,000 –&gt; 00:25:59,000<br>And then how we’re going to handle status codes and error handling for these.</p>
<p>226<br>00:25:59,000 –&gt; 00:26:03,000<br>I’m not going to care about authentication or any security stuff.</p>
<p>227<br>00:26:03,000 –&gt; 00:26:06,000<br>Again, this is just a prototype for us.</p>
<p>228<br>00:26:06,000 –&gt; 00:26:10,000<br>So all those things we don’t have to worry about.</p>
<p>229<br>00:26:10,000 –&gt; 00:26:19,000<br>And so now what’s going to happen also to with this API justification is that the two groups that are building the same component have the same API.</p>
<p>230<br>00:26:19,000 –&gt; 00:26:27,000<br>So the way this is going to work is each group is going to have to have designated one person as a liaison that’s going to talk to the other group.</p>
<p>231<br>00:26:27,000 –&gt; 00:26:33,000<br>And they have to get together to decide, okay, here’s the, here’s what the API needs to be.</p>
<p>232<br>00:26:33,000 –&gt; 00:26:42,000<br>And so that way if we decide to choose one project versus another at the end of the semester, they’ll implement the same API to everything that still work.</p>
<p>233<br>00:26:42,000 –&gt; 00:26:55,000<br>And then the liaisons, when it may need to talk to liaisons and other groups, make sure that they understand what the, you know, what is expected of the data or the, the outputs that they’re generating.</p>
<p>234<br>00:26:55,000 –&gt; 00:27:07,000<br>So for the API is rather than write everything scratch because it’s certainly two weeks is not enough to figure it all this out, especially for some of you that are like coming up to us, you know, from, from, you know, first time thinking about these things.</p>
<p>235<br>00:27:07,000 –&gt; 00:27:11,000<br>We want to reuse as much existing APIs as possible.</p>
<p>236<br>00:27:11,000 –&gt; 00:27:18,000<br>So example would be the catalog service should just reuse the Apache iceberg API.</p>
<p>237<br>00:27:18,000 –&gt; 00:27:22,000<br>Expose that same, same interface and that’ll save a bunch of trouble.</p>
<p>238<br>00:27:22,000 –&gt; 00:27:29,000<br>So for the career optimizer team, the cal site would be another choice of any API we could use for execution engine.</p>
<p>239<br>00:27:29,000 –&gt; 00:27:30,000<br>We could follow the logs or data.</p>
<p>240<br>00:27:30,000 –&gt; 00:27:44,000<br>So by all means reach out to the, I would discuss this class reach out to the, the TAs and structures will figure out, okay, here’s the, here’s the API, you should be, you should be trying to follow these guides towards something to look at.</p>
<p>241<br>00:27:44,000 –&gt; 00:27:55,000<br>The other cool thing actually to it if the two project teams also implement the same API, then you could do end to end high level testing and use the same infrastructure.</p>
<p>242<br>00:27:55,000 –&gt; 00:28:10,000<br>So for example, like, if the API is the same, then like the catalog service you could have like, you get this table metadata, you could have testing code that could be reused for, for both those teams along the same API.</p>
<p>243<br>00:28:11,000 –&gt; 00:28:15,000<br>So then throughout the, the later this semester, we’ll have two status updates.</p>
<p>244<br>00:28:15,000 –&gt; 00:28:20,000<br>And this is just a five minute presentation in class to everyone to say, here’s the status of the project.</p>
<p>245<br>00:28:20,000 –&gt; 00:28:25,000<br>Like, here’s how far we’ve made it. Here’s what’s changed in our plan since the last time we presented.</p>
<p>246<br>00:28:25,000 –&gt; 00:28:31,000<br>What are some of the surprises you’ve encountered of, you know, either how hard or how easy some sort of things are going to be.</p>
<p>247<br>00:28:31,000 –&gt; 00:28:39,000<br>We’ll talk more about this as go along, but we’ll have, we’ll enable like testing coverage checks and make sure like your tests are actually, you’re writing code and it’s actually being very, very important.</p>
<p>248<br>00:28:39,000 –&gt; 00:28:43,000<br>And then you’re going to be able to see how things are evolving over time.</p>
<p>249<br>00:28:43,000 –&gt; 00:28:47,000<br>So you’ll want to basically mean this is what you have to turn on the semester.</p>
<p>250<br>00:28:47,000 –&gt; 00:28:55,000<br>So just keep maintaining this document as you go along so that it’s not like you’d go right from scratch when it comes time for like for finals week.</p>
<p>251<br>00:28:55,000 –&gt; 00:28:59,000<br>And then you can see how things are evolving over time.</p>
<p>252<br>00:28:59,000 –&gt; 00:29:03,000<br>And then you can see that this is what you have to turn on the semester.</p>
<p>253<br>00:29:03,000 –&gt; 00:29:10,000<br>So just keep maintaining this document as you go along so that it’s not like you’d go right from scratch when it comes time for like for finals week.</p>
<p>254<br>00:29:10,000 –&gt; 00:29:15,000<br>And again, the liaisons were want to talk to each other. So here’s how we implement.</p>
<p>255<br>00:29:15,000 –&gt; 00:29:21,000<br>Here’s how I’m going to implement certain benchmarks and tests because at the end of the semester, we want to actually do comparisons in some way.</p>
<p>256<br>00:29:21,000 –&gt; 00:29:28,000<br>So you can see what’s the effectiveness or for API coverage or performance of these different parts.</p>
<p>257<br>00:29:28,000 –&gt; 00:29:31,000<br>So how are you actually going to compare these guys?</p>
<p>258<br>00:29:31,000 –&gt; 00:29:45,000<br>And then during the finals week, we’ll have a final presentation and talk about here’s what you implemented, what you accomplished, and then how to measure the performance differences between the two different implementations.</p>
<p>259<br>00:29:45,000 –&gt; 00:29:54,000<br>For the final benchmarks that compare your implementation as the other groups, we’ll have, we have nice dedicated machines here at CMU that you want to use for these valuation.</p>
<p>260<br>00:29:54,000 –&gt; 00:30:00,000<br>So we’ll coordinate this later, but the liaisons will be responsible for actually scheduling the time and running those benchmarks.</p>
<p>261<br>00:30:00,000 –&gt; 00:30:06,000<br>So we have a true apples app, let’s compare some between the different groups.</p>
<p>262<br>00:30:06,000 –&gt; 00:30:16,000<br>And then lastly is that we’re not going to say any project is completed until we get a final code drop. And that means all the comments and other code of use issues on GitHub, volume addressed.</p>
<p>263<br>00:30:16,000 –&gt; 00:30:22,000<br>We have all proper test cases, we make sure everything’s sort of working and we have nice documentation and comments in the source code.</p>
<p>264<br>00:30:22,000 –&gt; 00:30:28,000<br>So you can set you hand it over to the next class and let them pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>265<br>00:30:28,000 –&gt; 00:30:42,000<br>Or in some cases, some of you students are doing master’s thesis or you know, capture projects, you know, when you come back in the spring semester or so the fall semester, you have something to pick up on and you know how to keep continuing things.</p>
<p>266<br>00:30:43,000 –&gt; 00:30:52,000<br>Alright, so this one doesn’t go to that saying, you don’t want to plagiarize, don’t copy code that’s not yours without getting permission from structures.</p>
<p>267<br>00:30:52,000 –&gt; 00:30:58,000<br>Again, for some things like parts of an execution engine, you can go look at data fusion and see how they do certain things.</p>
<p>268<br>00:30:58,000 –&gt; 00:31:06,000<br>I’m not saying they do everything correctly, but the best way, but if you want to sort of pick high the ideas of how they set up the code, that’s okay.</p>
<p>269<br>00:31:06,000 –&gt; 00:31:11,000<br>But you know, obviously just don’t wholesale copy things and try to pass it off as your own.</p>
<p>270<br>00:31:11,000 –&gt; 00:31:21,000<br>We make sure that we know that the lineage of any source code that we’re adding to this project, you know, where it came from and make sure that it’s another right serving sense.</p>
<p>271<br>00:31:22,000 –&gt; 00:31:28,000<br>Alright, so that’s it for now. The sun’s coming out. I got it going.</p>
<p>272<br>00:31:29,000 –&gt; 00:31:40,000<br>So for next class, we’ll have the first lecture on the first paper on sort of modern analytical systems. So this will be, I think from the data guys describing what they do.</p>
<p>273<br>00:31:42,000 –&gt; 00:31:49,000<br>You’ll want to submit the first reading review for this game before class starts and then use that link there and that’ll take you to the Google form to fill it out.</p>
<p>274<br>00:31:50,000 –&gt; 00:32:01,000<br>And I also talk a little more about project logistics. I’ll put some on Piazza. Again, you’re not in a group had a had to find a group and start getting the process of writing your project proposal, let’s do it 31st.</p>
<p>275<br>00:32:02,000 –&gt; 00:32:17,000<br>And then for the election notes, again, go check to see what your sign notes data is and for the ones that are where we have more, we have more students and lectures.
