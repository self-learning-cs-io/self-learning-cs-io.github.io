                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,200<br>In this video, we’re going to continue our discussion of register allocation.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,200 –&gt; 00:00:10,480<br>And this time, we’re going to talk about what happens when we can’t successfully color</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,480 –&gt; 00:00:17,760<br>the graph, in which case we have to do something known as spilling.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,760 –&gt; 00:00:22,320<br>The graph coloring heuristic that we discussed in the previous video doesn’t always succeed</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,320 –&gt; 00:00:28,280<br>in coloring an arbitrary graph, and it may well get stuck and not be able to find a coloring.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,280 –&gt; 00:00:32,679<br>And so in that case, the only conclusion we can reach is that we can’t hold all the values</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,679 –&gt; 00:00:34,039<br>that we’d like to in registers.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:34,039 –&gt; 00:00:38,000<br>We have more temporary values than we have registers to hold them.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:38,000 –&gt; 00:00:40,920<br>And those temporary values have to live somewhere, and so where should they live?</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:40,920 –&gt; 00:00:42,600<br>Well, they’re going to have to live in memory.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:42,600 –&gt; 00:00:45,040<br>That’s the only other kind of storage that we have.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:45,040 –&gt; 00:00:48,040<br>And so we’re going to pick some values and spill them into memory.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:48,040 –&gt; 00:00:52,520<br>The idea is that we have the picture in your mind should be of a bucket, and it can hold</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:52,520 –&gt; 00:00:54,000<br>a fixed amount of stuff.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:54,000 –&gt; 00:00:55,480<br>Those are the registers.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:55,479 –&gt; 00:01:02,439<br>And when it gets too full, some of the stuff spills over and ends up someplace else.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:02,439 –&gt; 00:01:04,640<br>Now when does a graph coloring heuristic get stuck?</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:04,640 –&gt; 00:01:08,719<br>Well, the only situation in which it won’t be able to make progress is if all the nodes</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:08,719 –&gt; 00:01:11,439<br>have K or more neighbors.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:11,439 –&gt; 00:01:15,479<br>So let’s take a look at our favorite register interference graph, the one we’ve been using</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:15,479 –&gt; 00:01:16,799<br>in our examples.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:16,799 –&gt; 00:01:21,039<br>And now let’s say that the machine we want to use only has three registers.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:21,040 –&gt; 00:01:25,880<br>And so we instead of finding a four coloring of this graph, we need to find a three coloring.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:25,880 –&gt; 00:01:28,560<br>So let’s think about how to find a three coloring of this graph.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:28,560 –&gt; 00:01:32,360<br>Well, if we apply the heuristic, we’ll remove A from the graph.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:32,360 –&gt; 00:01:35,960<br>But then we’re going to get stuck because once you take A out of the graph and it edges</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:35,960 –&gt; 00:01:42,840<br>out, every node that’s left has more than as three or more neighbors, as at least three</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:42,840 –&gt; 00:01:43,840<br>neighbors.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:43,840 –&gt; 00:01:48,360<br>And so there’s no node that we can delete from the graph and be guaranteed to be able to</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:48,359 –&gt; 00:01:56,719<br>find a coloring for it with the heuristic that we discussed in the previous video.</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:56,719 –&gt; 00:02:00,840<br>So in this situation, what we’re going to do is we’re going to pick a node as a candidate</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:00,840 –&gt; 00:02:01,840<br>for spilling.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:01,840 –&gt; 00:02:07,920<br>This is a node that we, or a temporary, that we are probably, or we think we may have to</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:07,920 –&gt; 00:02:11,560<br>assign to a memory location rather than to a register.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:11,560 –&gt; 00:02:16,400<br>And let’s just assume for the sake of this example that we pick F. And we’ll talk later</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:16,400 –&gt; 00:02:19,560<br>about how to choose the node to spill.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:19,560 –&gt; 00:02:23,360<br>There’s a number of different ways to choose the particular node to spill.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:23,360 –&gt; 00:02:26,200<br>But for the illustration of this example, it doesn’t matter how we pick it, we just have</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:26,200 –&gt; 00:02:28,879<br>to pick one to remove from the graph.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:28,879 –&gt; 00:02:33,400<br>Okay, so we’re going to say we’re going to remove, that we’re going to spill F. So what</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:33,400 –&gt; 00:02:38,599<br>we’ll do then is we’ll remove F from the graph just like before and then we’ll continue</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:38,599 –&gt; 00:02:39,599<br>with our simplification.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:39,599 –&gt; 00:02:43,159<br>And this will now succeed because once we remove F from the graph, we can see that all</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:43,159 –&gt; 00:02:49,400<br>the nodes, well actually several of the nodes have fewer than three neighbors.</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:49,400 –&gt; 00:02:54,759<br>And so B, C, and D, sorry B and D both only have two neighbors.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:54,759 –&gt; 00:02:58,120<br>Once they’re deleted, E and C will only have one neighbor each.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:58,120 –&gt; 00:03:00,439<br>And so clearly coloring will now succeed.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:00,439 –&gt; 00:03:07,400<br>And here’s one order that will succeed with this reduced graph.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:07,400 –&gt; 00:03:13,079<br>After we decide to spill F and we successfully color the subgraph, now we have to try to</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:13,080 –&gt; 00:03:19,320<br>assign a color to F. And it could be, we could get lucky and discover that even though F</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:19,320 –&gt; 00:03:25,480<br>had more than three neighbors or three or more neighbors, when we removed it from the</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:25,480 –&gt; 00:03:31,400<br>graph, it could be that when we go and start coloring for the subgraph, that those neighbors</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:31,400 –&gt; 00:03:33,439<br>actually don’t use all of the registers.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:33,439 –&gt; 00:03:37,400<br>It could wind up being that all those neighbors, for example, are assigned to the same register.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:37,400 –&gt; 00:03:41,760<br>And so there are plenty of registers left over to assign to F.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:41,759 –&gt; 00:03:44,639<br>And so this is called optimistic coloring.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:44,639 –&gt; 00:03:46,560<br>So we pick a candidate for spilling.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:46,560 –&gt; 00:03:50,439<br>We try to color the subgraph once we have a coloring for the subgraph, then we see if we</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:50,439 –&gt; 00:03:58,039<br>just get lucky and are able to assign a register to F, in which case we can just go ahead and</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:58,039 –&gt; 00:04:00,959<br>continue to color the rest of the graph as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:00,959 –&gt; 00:04:03,560<br>So in this case, let’s take a look what happens.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:03,560 –&gt; 00:04:10,799<br>We’re going to add F back into the graph and look at all and look at its neighbors and we</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:10,800 –&gt; 00:04:16,879<br>see that we have a neighbor that’s using R1, we have a neighbor that’s using R2, and</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:16,879 –&gt; 00:04:18,879<br>we have a neighbor that’s using R3.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:18,879 –&gt; 00:04:21,759<br>And so in this case, optimistic coloring will not work.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:21,759 –&gt; 00:04:27,960<br>So in fact, F had more than K neighbors and after we color the subgraph, it turns out that</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:27,960 –&gt; 00:04:33,199<br>those neighbors are using all K, in this case, three, all three of the register names.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:33,199 –&gt; 00:04:37,879<br>And so F, well there is no register left over for F, and we’re going to have to actually</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:37,879 –&gt; 00:04:42,079<br>spill it and store it in memory.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:42,079 –&gt; 00:04:46,600<br>So if optimistic coloring fails as it does in this example, then we spill F. So what we’re</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:46,600 –&gt; 00:04:50,839<br>going to do is allocate a memory location for F, and typically what that means is that</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:50,839 –&gt; 00:04:54,319<br>it will allocate a position in the current stack frame.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:54,319 –&gt; 00:04:59,199<br>Let’s call this address FAA for the address of F.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:59,199 –&gt; 00:05:02,399<br>And then we’re going to modify the control flow graph.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:02,399 –&gt; 00:05:05,839<br>We’re going to change the code that we’re compiling.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:05,839 –&gt; 00:05:12,479<br>So before each operation that reads F, we’re going to insert a load that loads from that</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:12,479 –&gt; 00:05:16,079<br>address the current value of F into a temporary name.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:16,079 –&gt; 00:05:20,279<br>Okay, and that makes sense because if the value is out in memory, then if we have an operation</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:20,279 –&gt; 00:05:24,439<br>that needs to actually use the value, we’re going to have to load it from memory first</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:24,439 –&gt; 00:05:27,039<br>into a register.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:27,039 –&gt; 00:05:31,279<br>And similarly, after each operation that writes F, we’re going to insert the store.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:31,279 –&gt; 00:05:39,719<br>So we’re going to save the current value of F into its location in memory.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:39,719 –&gt; 00:05:43,839<br>So here’s the original code from which we constructed the register interference graph.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:43,839 –&gt; 00:05:48,119<br>And notice that there’s a few references to F in here and we just highlight them.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:48,119 –&gt; 00:05:51,519<br>All right, so we have a couple of reads and we have a write.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:51,519 –&gt; 00:05:55,000<br>And so now what are we going to do?</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:55,000 –&gt; 00:06:00,279<br>So here we have here we had the use of F, the read of F in this statement.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:00,279 –&gt; 00:06:01,879<br>Now we’ve proceeded that by a load.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:01,879 –&gt; 00:06:03,679<br>And notice that I’ve given a new name here.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:03,679 –&gt; 00:06:05,559<br>I’ve called this F1.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:05,559 –&gt; 00:06:10,079<br>And that’s because the different uses of F in the control of the graph don’t all have</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:10,079 –&gt; 00:06:12,319<br>to have the same temporary name.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:12,319 –&gt; 00:06:14,919<br>And actually it will be a good idea to separate them.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:14,919 –&gt; 00:06:17,839<br>So each distinct use of F will get its own name.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:17,839 –&gt; 00:06:21,919<br>So here we load the value of F and then it gets used in this statement.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:21,919 –&gt; 00:06:26,319<br>Here we have a write to F and so we store the current value of F. And now as I hear, I’ve</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:26,319 –&gt; 00:06:27,919<br>given a different name F2.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:27,920 –&gt; 00:06:31,759<br>So the temporary that’s computed here is going to be stored is called F2.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:31,759 –&gt; 00:06:38,160<br>And finally, the third use of F, there’s another load of F right here which is then used</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:38,160 –&gt; 00:06:42,000<br>in this computation here of B.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:42,000 –&gt; 00:06:50,879<br>Okay, so that is a systematic way to modify the code to use F in storage.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:50,879 –&gt; 00:06:54,360<br>And now we have to recompute the liveness of F.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:54,360 –&gt; 00:06:55,759<br>And so what happens there?</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:56,599 –&gt; 00:07:00,959<br>Well, here’s the original liveness information from which we computed the register interference</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:00,959 –&gt; 00:07:01,959<br>graph.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:01,959 –&gt; 00:07:02,800<br>Okay.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:02,800 –&gt; 00:07:06,319<br>And now notice that F is gone.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:06,319 –&gt; 00:07:11,319<br>We no longer use F in the program so we can delete all the places where we mentioned that</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:11,319 –&gt; 00:07:12,800<br>F was live.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:12,800 –&gt; 00:07:16,120<br>And now we have the three new names, F1, F2 and F3.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:16,120 –&gt; 00:07:18,839<br>And we have to add in their liveness information.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:18,839 –&gt; 00:07:23,159<br>So it created some new program points here where we inserted statements.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:23,160 –&gt; 00:07:29,160<br>And of course where we have a load of the current value of F, that value is live right</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:29,160 –&gt; 00:07:31,560<br>before the use in the next statement.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:31,560 –&gt; 00:07:37,080<br>Here we have the right of the current value of F and that’s li right before the store.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:37,080 –&gt; 00:07:42,440<br>And then here’s another load of the current value of F which is live until the store,</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:42,440 –&gt; 00:07:45,720<br>sorry, until the use in the next statement.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:45,720 –&gt; 00:07:46,720<br>Okay.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:46,760 –&gt; 00:07:53,640<br>So notice here that F used to be live in many, many, many places in the code.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:53,640 –&gt; 00:08:02,720<br>And now not only is F or the different versions of F live in fewer places, also we’ve distinguished</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:02,720 –&gt; 00:08:03,720<br>them.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:03,720 –&gt; 00:08:06,440<br>So we’ve actually separated the different uses of F. And so these will have their own</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:06,440 –&gt; 00:08:11,360<br>nodes and their own set of interferences in the graph and they won’t share them with</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:11,360 –&gt; 00:08:12,600<br>the other uses of F.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:12,600 –&gt; 00:08:18,879<br>And that will actually also reduce the number of edges in the graph.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:18,879 –&gt; 00:08:21,680<br>So summarize the example on the previous slide.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:21,680 –&gt; 00:08:26,720<br>Once we have decided that we’re actually going to spill a temporary F, that means we’re</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:26,720 –&gt; 00:08:30,000<br>going to change the program, we’re going to have loads and stores to the program and</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:30,000 –&gt; 00:08:33,720<br>now we’re going to have a different program and that’s going to change our register allocation</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:33,720 –&gt; 00:08:34,720<br>problems.</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:34,720 –&gt; 00:08:37,320<br>We’re going to have to recompute the live disinformation, we’re going to have to rebuild</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:37,320 –&gt; 00:08:42,360<br>the register interference graph and then we’re going to have to try again to color that</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:42,360 –&gt; 00:08:43,360<br>graph.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:43,360 –&gt; 00:08:48,840<br>Now it turns out that this new live disinformation is almost the same as it was before.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:48,840 –&gt; 00:08:55,440<br>So all the temporary names other than F are not much affected by the new statements that</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:55,440 –&gt; 00:08:56,440<br>are added.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:56,440 –&gt; 00:08:59,759<br>There’s a few new program points where they might be live, but every place they were live</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:59,759 –&gt; 00:09:02,120<br>before, they’re still live.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:02,120 –&gt; 00:09:06,680<br>And F itself has changed fairly dramatically.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:06,680 –&gt; 00:09:09,200<br>Its live disinformation has changed fairly dramatically.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:09,200 –&gt; 00:09:14,840<br>Certainly the old name F is no longer used and so its live disinformation goes away.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:14,840 –&gt; 00:09:20,280<br>And then we’ve also split F into three, in this case, three different temporaries, one</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:20,280 –&gt; 00:09:24,320<br>for each of the different uses of F in the control flow graph.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:24,320 –&gt; 00:09:29,320<br>And now notice that each of these new uses of F or these new versions of F is live in</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:29,320 –&gt; 00:09:31,879<br>a very, very small area.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:31,879 –&gt; 00:09:38,400<br>So a load, for a load instruction, the thing that we’re loading, the temporary that we’re</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:38,399 –&gt; 00:09:44,319<br>loading F i is live only between the load and the next instruction where it’s used.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:44,319 –&gt; 00:09:50,840<br>And similarly for a store, the store of a temporary F i is live only between the store itself</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:50,840 –&gt; 00:09:54,360<br>and the preceding instruction, the one that created F i.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:54,360 –&gt; 00:09:59,679<br>And the effect of this is to greatly reduce the live range of the spill variable.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:59,679 –&gt; 00:10:04,360<br>So whatever name we decide to spill by adding the loads and stores right next to the places</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:04,360 –&gt; 00:10:08,720<br>where those values are used, we dramatically reduce the live range.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:08,720 –&gt; 00:10:13,879<br>And in addition, as I mentioned on the previous slide, by splitting the name F into multiple</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:13,879 –&gt; 00:10:22,399<br>different names, we also avoid sharing those different live ranges between the different</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:22,399 –&gt; 00:10:25,840<br>versions of F.</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:25,840 –&gt; 00:10:31,399<br>So because the live range of F is reduced by spilling, it has fewer interferences in the</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:31,399 –&gt; 00:10:34,199<br>new program than it did in the old program.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:34,199 –&gt; 00:10:38,039<br>And what that means in particular is that in the rebuilt register interference graph, F will</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:38,039 –&gt; 00:10:40,120<br>have fewer neighbors.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:40,120 –&gt; 00:10:46,319<br>Some of the neighbors that it had before have gone away because it just live in fewer places.</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:46,319 –&gt; 00:10:50,159<br>So if we look at the new register interference graph, we can see that among all the different</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:50,159 –&gt; 00:10:56,319<br>versions of F, remember that F has been split into three temporaries in this graph, we see</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:56,320 –&gt; 00:11:03,560<br>that they only interfere now with the Nc, whereas before F had several other neighbors</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:03,560 –&gt; 00:11:04,560<br>in the graph.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:04,560 –&gt; 00:11:07,960<br>And now in fact, this new graph is three colorable.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:07,960 –&gt; 00:11:13,640<br>Now, of course, it might be the case that we can’t just spill one name.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:13,640 –&gt; 00:11:18,440<br>We might have to spill several different temporaries before our coloring is found.</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:18,440 –&gt; 00:11:21,520<br>And the tricky part is deciding what to spill.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:21,520 –&gt; 00:11:25,920<br>So this is the hard decision that has to be made during register allocation.</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:25,919 –&gt; 00:11:27,439<br>Now any choice is correct.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:27,439 –&gt; 00:11:29,519<br>It’s only a question of performance.</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:29,519 –&gt; 00:11:35,399<br>So some choices of spilling will lead to better code than others, but any choice of spilling</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:35,399 –&gt; 00:11:38,199<br>is going to result in a correct program.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:38,199 –&gt; 00:11:43,879<br>And there are some heuristics that people use to pick which temporaries to spill.</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:43,879 –&gt; 00:11:47,079<br>And here are a few, or I think three of the most popular ones.</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:47,079 –&gt; 00:11:50,759<br>One is to spill the temporaries and have the most conflicts.</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:50,759 –&gt; 00:11:56,360<br>And the reason for that is that this is the temporary, the one thing that you can move</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:56,360 –&gt; 00:12:01,639<br>into memory that will most affect the number of interferences in the graph.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:01,639 –&gt; 00:12:06,840<br>So the idea is by possibly spilling just this one variable will remove enough edges from</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:06,840 –&gt; 00:12:11,120<br>the graph that it becomes colorable with the number of registers we have.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:11,120 –&gt; 00:12:16,159<br>Another possibility is to spill temporaries that have few definitions and uses.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:16,159 –&gt; 00:12:21,839<br>And here the idea is that by spilling those, since they’re not used very much, the number</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:21,839 –&gt; 00:12:25,519<br>of loads and stores will have to add will be relatively small.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:25,519 –&gt; 00:12:30,399<br>And so if a variable disinsisting it in very many places, then the actual cost in terms</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:30,399 –&gt; 00:12:37,439<br>of additional instructions that are going to be executed to spill it is relatively small.</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:37,439 –&gt; 00:12:41,839<br>And another one, and this is actually one that I think that all the compiler’s implement</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:41,839 –&gt; 00:12:44,039<br>is to avoid spilling in inter loops.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:44,039 –&gt; 00:12:49,799<br>So if you have a choice between spilling a variable that’s used within the intermost</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:49,799 –&gt; 00:12:55,439<br>loop of the program and one that’s used someplace else, you probably prefer to spill the one</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:55,439 –&gt; 00:13:00,679<br>that’s used not in the intermost loop because again, that will result in fewer loads and</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:00,679 –&gt; 00:13:01,679<br>stores.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:01,679 –&gt; 00:13:05,199<br>You really want to avoid adding additional instructions to your interloop.</p>
