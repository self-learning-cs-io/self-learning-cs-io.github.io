                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:11,400<br>In this video, we’re going to talk about program or defined exceptions.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:11,400 –&gt; 00:00:14,040<br>So think about the following typical program scenario.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:14,040 –&gt; 00:00:19,019<br>You’re deep into some fairly complex section of code and you come to a place where you</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,019 –&gt; 00:00:21,760<br>could experience an unexpected error.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,760 –&gt; 00:00:27,280<br>There could be something that could happen that would violate some important property of</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:27,280 –&gt; 00:00:28,280<br>your program.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,280 –&gt; 00:00:31,600<br>For example, maybe you’re going to discover that a place where you could be out of memory</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:31,600 –&gt; 00:00:35,600<br>or there’s some data structure that doesn’t satisfy some invariant.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:35,600 –&gt; 00:00:38,880<br>So a list is supposed to be sorted, that is not, or something like that.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:38,880 –&gt; 00:00:40,439<br>And the question is, how do you handle these errors?</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:40,439 –&gt; 00:00:46,120<br>How do you write code that will handle the error gracefully and not make your program really,</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:46,120 –&gt; 00:00:48,799<br>really ugly?</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:48,799 –&gt; 00:00:52,880<br>So a popular solution to this problem in many languages, including Java, is add a new</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:52,880 –&gt; 00:00:56,880<br>kind of value to the language called an exception.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:56,880 –&gt; 00:01:00,320<br>And we’ll have a couple of control constructs for dealing with exceptions.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:00,320 –&gt; 00:01:05,640<br>Here is the two that are probably the most popular and these are as they appear in Java.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:05,640 –&gt; 00:01:07,159<br>So we can throw exceptions.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:07,159 –&gt; 00:01:12,320<br>And what this does is it causes an exception to be created at this point wherever the throw</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:12,320 –&gt; 00:01:14,040<br>occurs.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:14,040 –&gt; 00:01:17,120<br>And that exception will simply propagate out of the program.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:17,120 –&gt; 00:01:21,480<br>It’ll basically halt the execution of the program at that point.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:21,480 –&gt; 00:01:27,400<br>And any containing constructs will also throw the exception.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:27,400 –&gt; 00:01:32,719<br>So the exception will simply propagate up out of the code that’s currently executing until</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:32,719 –&gt; 00:01:36,200<br>it hits a try catch.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:36,200 –&gt; 00:01:37,359<br>So how does this work?</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:37,359 –&gt; 00:01:39,080<br>Well we can try something.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:39,080 –&gt; 00:01:40,920<br>We can execute some expression here.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:40,920 –&gt; 00:01:43,480<br>This will be some expression.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:43,480 –&gt; 00:01:48,560<br>And if this expression throws an exception, if a throw occurs somewhere inside this expression,</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:48,560 –&gt; 00:01:50,879<br>then we will catch that exception.</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:50,879 –&gt; 00:01:56,040<br>And there can be a binding here to say what we’re going to call the exception value.</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:56,040 –&gt; 00:01:57,040<br>So this is like a let.</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:57,040 –&gt; 00:01:59,240<br>We’ll grab the exception that comes out of here.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:59,240 –&gt; 00:02:00,799<br>We’ll call it x.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:00,799 –&gt; 00:02:06,840<br>And then we can execute this piece of cleanup code to handle the exception in some way.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:06,840 –&gt; 00:02:14,800<br>And so the basic idea behind this design for handling exceptions is at the place where</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:14,800 –&gt; 00:02:18,520<br>you have the exception, the place where you actually detect the exception might be somewhat</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:18,520 –&gt; 00:02:23,800<br>somewhere deep inside the code and not a very good place for actually dealing with the exception.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:23,800 –&gt; 00:02:27,280<br>So what you want to do is get out of that part of the code, get back to some higher level</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:27,280 –&gt; 00:02:33,360<br>point where you can clean things up, deal with the exception, and then retry perhaps some</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:33,360 –&gt; 00:02:37,160<br>larger block of code.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:37,160 –&gt; 00:02:40,480<br>Here’s a little example of using exceptions.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:40,480 –&gt; 00:02:42,400<br>So here we have our main method.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:42,400 –&gt; 00:02:44,200<br>And what are we going to do?</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:44,200 –&gt; 00:02:47,080<br>We’re going to have a try block that just calls a function x.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:47,080 –&gt; 00:02:51,280<br>And if that raises an exception, then we will catch the exception.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:51,280 –&gt; 00:02:53,160<br>In this case, we don’t do anything with the exception.</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:53,160 –&gt; 00:02:57,240<br>We just print out a message saying there was an error and we terminate the program.</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:57,240 –&gt; 00:02:59,000<br>So we don’t do anything very smart.</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:59,000 –&gt; 00:03:03,560<br>But we do catch the exception and at least print out an error rather than just terminating.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:03,560 –&gt; 00:03:05,200<br>So what does x do?</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:05,200 –&gt; 00:03:08,040<br>Well x simply throws an exception.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:08,040 –&gt; 00:03:13,920<br>So this function x allocates an exception object.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:13,920 –&gt; 00:03:14,920<br>This is just a value.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:14,919 –&gt; 00:03:18,479<br>It’s just a class like everything else, but it has a special property that it can be thrown.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:18,479 –&gt; 00:03:23,679<br>So when we throw it, that’s when x terminates abnormally and we end up in the catch block</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:23,679 –&gt; 00:03:29,039<br>of the trichatch expression back in the main method.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:29,039 –&gt; 00:03:33,639<br>Now in the last couple of slides, I gave you a very informal description of how exceptions</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:33,639 –&gt; 00:03:34,639<br>work.</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:34,639 –&gt; 00:03:37,079<br>And it might not have been very clear.</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:37,079 –&gt; 00:03:42,039<br>And in fact, it’s hard, I think, to give a very clear description without some kind</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:42,039 –&gt; 00:03:45,639<br>of formal description of how exceptions are supposed to behave.</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:45,639 –&gt; 00:03:49,400<br>But fortunately, we’ve looked at operational semantics in this class and so now you’re</p>
<p>64<br>00:03:49,400 –&gt; 00:03:53,120<br>familiar with those kinds of descriptions of language behavior.</p>
<p>65<br>00:03:53,120 –&gt; 00:03:58,919<br>And I can actually describe you pretty succinctly how trichatch actually really works.</p>
<p>66<br>00:03:58,919 –&gt; 00:04:04,280<br>So we’re going to give operational rules here for trichatch expressions.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:04,280 –&gt; 00:04:07,840<br>And I just noticed, I just point out here that I had some kind of font problem.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:07,840 –&gt; 00:04:11,039<br>And so I had to write in the turn styles by hand in this slide.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:11,039 –&gt; 00:04:16,759<br>So those handwritten characters are all supposed to be the turn style character.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:16,759 –&gt; 00:04:22,240<br>Now to more important things, there’s a distinction with exceptions.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:22,240 –&gt; 00:04:26,399<br>There are two kinds of states that an exception object could be in.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:26,399 –&gt; 00:04:28,039<br>It could just be an ordinary value.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:28,039 –&gt; 00:04:33,240<br>So when I say new exception object in Java, say when I say something new that’s of the exception</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:33,240 –&gt; 00:04:35,959<br>class, it’s just an ordinary value at that point.</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:35,959 –&gt; 00:04:38,480<br>It just behaves like any other object.</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:38,480 –&gt; 00:04:41,319<br>But then there’s a distinction when the object is thrown.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:41,319 –&gt; 00:04:45,040<br>So when the exception is actually thrown, it becomes a special kind of value.</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:45,040 –&gt; 00:04:47,040<br>And it gets treated differently.</p>
<p>79<br>00:04:47,040 –&gt; 00:04:53,720<br>So we’re going to distinguish between an ordinary object v and objects that have been thrown,</p>
<p>80<br>00:04:53,720 –&gt; 00:04:57,520<br>which are then active exceptions.</p>
<p>81<br>00:04:57,520 –&gt; 00:05:03,920<br>So let’s take a look at some of the operational rules for the exception constructs.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:03,920 –&gt; 00:05:06,920<br>So here’s one rule for it’s a try catch block.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:06,920 –&gt; 00:05:12,520<br>And what this rule says is that if an expression evaluates to an ordinary value, if it doesn’t</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:12,520 –&gt; 00:05:17,080<br>throw an exception, then the result of the try catch block is just that value.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:17,080 –&gt; 00:05:22,319<br>So the way a try catch block works is you evaluate the expression in the try block.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:22,319 –&gt; 00:05:28,319<br>If that terminates normally with a value, then the result of the whole expression is just</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:28,319 –&gt; 00:05:29,319<br>that value.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:29,319 –&gt; 00:05:30,319<br>All right.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:30,560 –&gt; 00:05:34,159<br>The other possibility is that you’ll evaluate a try catch block.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:34,159 –&gt; 00:05:38,920<br>And when you go to evaluate the expression in the try block, e1, it will throw an exception.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:38,920 –&gt; 00:05:41,279<br>So it could result in a thrown exception.</p>
<p>92<br>00:05:41,279 –&gt; 00:05:42,879<br>So this is this case.</p>
<p>93<br>00:05:42,879 –&gt; 00:05:49,560<br>OK, that that, excuse me, is this case where e1 evaluates to one of these special values.</p>
<p>94<br>00:05:49,560 –&gt; 00:05:51,759<br>It’s been marked as a thrown exception.</p>
<p>95<br>00:05:51,759 –&gt; 00:05:52,759<br>What do we do in that case?</p>
<p>96<br>00:05:52,759 –&gt; 00:05:55,879<br>Well, we unwrap the exception.</p>
<p>97<br>00:05:55,879 –&gt; 00:05:59,759<br>We pull out the value that’s in the thrown exception.</p>
<p>98<br>00:05:59,759 –&gt; 00:06:02,279<br>We bind it to some local name, all right.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:02,279 –&gt; 00:06:05,279<br>That’s named in the catch expression.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:05,279 –&gt; 00:06:07,240<br>And then we evaluate the cleanup code.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:07,240 –&gt; 00:06:10,519<br>So with the exception value available, we evaluate e2.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:10,519 –&gt; 00:06:18,959<br>And whatever the result is of e2, that is the result of the try catch block.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:18,959 –&gt; 00:06:20,279<br>How does throw work?</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:20,279 –&gt; 00:06:21,279<br>It’s very simple.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:21,279 –&gt; 00:06:23,839<br>So throw just takes an expression.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:23,839 –&gt; 00:06:25,000<br>It evaluates that expression.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:25,000 –&gt; 00:06:26,519<br>It gets an value v.</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:26,519 –&gt; 00:06:31,639<br>And then it marks that value as a thrown exception, as a thrown exception.</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:31,639 –&gt; 00:06:34,759<br>So it wraps the value in this T thing.</p>
<p>110<br>00:06:34,759 –&gt; 00:06:38,799<br>And that indicates that this exception now has been thrown.</p>
<p>111<br>00:06:38,799 –&gt; 00:06:42,799<br>Now the only other thing we need to talk about is how the rest of the language, all the</p>
<p>112<br>00:06:42,799 –&gt; 00:06:48,199<br>other constructs in the language, deal with these thrown exceptions.</p>
<p>113<br>00:06:48,199 –&gt; 00:06:49,799<br>And that’s very simple.</p>
<p>114<br>00:06:49,799 –&gt; 00:06:55,279<br>We want those thrown exceptions to simply propagate out of any other kind of expression.</p>
<p>115<br>00:06:55,279 –&gt; 00:06:59,519<br>So for example, we’ll just do one example here because the idea is the same for every</p>
<p>116<br>00:06:59,519 –&gt; 00:07:01,319<br>other language construct.</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:01,319 –&gt; 00:07:05,879<br>Let’s say that we’re evaluating e1 plus e2.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:05,879 –&gt; 00:07:09,559<br>So the first thing we need to do of course is to evaluate e1.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:09,559 –&gt; 00:07:14,759<br>And if that happens to throw an exception, so something goes wrong in the evaluation of</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:14,759 –&gt; 00:07:20,359<br>e1 and e1 evaluates to a thrown exception, well then we stop the evaluation of the plus</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:20,359 –&gt; 00:07:21,359<br>right there.</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:21,359 –&gt; 00:07:22,359<br>We don’t even evaluate e2.</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:22,360 –&gt; 00:07:25,960<br>Notice that e2 is not mentioned here above the line.</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:25,960 –&gt; 00:07:28,000<br>It’s one of the things to be evaluated.</p>
<p>125<br>00:07:28,000 –&gt; 00:07:33,120<br>So if e1 terminates abnormally within an exception, then the result of the entire addition is</p>
<p>126<br>00:07:33,120 –&gt; 00:07:34,520<br>that exception.</p>
<p>127<br>00:07:34,520 –&gt; 00:07:40,160<br>And similarly for all the other constructs, if there’s one of their sub-expressions results</p>
<p>128<br>00:07:40,160 –&gt; 00:07:46,280<br>in an exception, in fact if as soon as one of their sub-expressions results in an exception,</p>
<p>129<br>00:07:46,280 –&gt; 00:07:49,199<br>they stop evaluating and propagate that exception up.</p>
<p>130<br>00:07:49,199 –&gt; 00:07:52,920<br>The only thing that will stop the exception from propagating all the way out to become</p>
<p>131<br>00:07:52,920 –&gt; 00:08:00,199<br>the result of the whole program is if it is caught in a tri-catch block.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:00,199 –&gt; 00:08:05,079<br>There are many ways to implement exceptions and here is one simple way to do it.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:05,079 –&gt; 00:08:09,519<br>So when we encounter a tri-expression, we will mark the current location in the stack.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:09,519 –&gt; 00:08:12,439<br>So we will mark the position in the stack where we encounter the tri.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:12,439 –&gt; 00:08:16,839<br>So for example, here say is our stack.</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:16,839 –&gt; 00:08:19,519<br>Let’s say that the stack is going this way.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:19,519 –&gt; 00:08:21,799<br>We encounter a tri-expression here.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:21,799 –&gt; 00:08:26,199<br>So we put some kind of marker in the stack to indicate that there’s a tri that was encountered</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:26,199 –&gt; 00:08:27,199<br>there.</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:27,199 –&gt; 00:08:31,239<br>And then we go on evaluating things inside of the tri, which might add more stuff to the</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:31,239 –&gt; 00:08:32,240<br>stack.</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:32,240 –&gt; 00:08:36,360<br>Now when we throw an exception, if down here all of a sudden the throw occurs when we’re</p>
<p>143<br>00:08:36,360 –&gt; 00:08:41,519<br>at this point in the execution, what’s going to happen is we’re going to unwind the</p>
<p>144<br>00:08:41,519 –&gt; 00:08:42,519<br>stacks.</p>
<p>145<br>00:08:42,519 –&gt; 00:08:44,399<br>We’re going to knock everything off the stack.</p>
<p>146<br>00:08:44,399 –&gt; 00:08:48,840<br>We’re going to pop all of this stuff off the stack so it’s all gone back to the first</p>
<p>147<br>00:08:48,840 –&gt; 00:08:49,840<br>tri.</p>
<p>148<br>00:08:49,840 –&gt; 00:08:51,919<br>And then we’ll execute the corresponding catch.</p>
<p>149<br>00:08:51,919 –&gt; 00:08:56,399<br>So here we have marked the place in the code where there was a tri and we can use that</p>
<p>150<br>00:08:56,399 –&gt; 00:09:01,840<br>to find the expression, the piece of the code that has the corresponding catch block and</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:01,840 –&gt; 00:09:05,759<br>we’ll unwind the stack to that point and then begin evaluation at the catch.</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:05,759 –&gt; 00:09:13,360<br>So this particular design has the disadvantage that tries actually costs something.</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:13,360 –&gt; 00:09:19,159<br>So even if you don’t throw an exception, you still pay something to execute a tri catch</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:19,159 –&gt; 00:09:20,159<br>block.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:20,159 –&gt; 00:09:24,200<br>You have to at least mark the stack and remember to unmark it, of course, when you pop things</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:24,200 –&gt; 00:09:26,919<br>off the stack when you leave the tri block.</p>
<p>157<br>00:09:26,919 –&gt; 00:09:33,279<br>So more complex techniques tries reduce the cost of try and throw and also trade off between</p>
<p>158<br>00:09:33,279 –&gt; 00:09:34,279<br>them.</p>
<p>159<br>00:09:34,279 –&gt; 00:09:38,800<br>And generally, the thing you want to do is because exceptions are probably relatively rare</p>
<p>160<br>00:09:38,799 –&gt; 00:09:44,079<br>in most programs is to make the cost of try as low as possible, possibly the expense</p>
<p>161<br>00:09:44,079 –&gt; 00:09:50,240<br>of making throws slightly more expensive.</p>
<p>162<br>00:09:50,240 –&gt; 00:09:53,519<br>Now here’s a little trivia question about Java.</p>
<p>163<br>00:09:53,519 –&gt; 00:09:59,479<br>So what happens to an uncought exception that’s thrown during object finalization?</p>
<p>164<br>00:09:59,479 –&gt; 00:10:04,319<br>So if you don’t know what object finalization is, well, when an object is collected, when</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:04,320 –&gt; 00:10:11,200<br>an object is garbage collected, it is possible to run a method on that object to clean it</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:11,200 –&gt; 00:10:14,200<br>up before the garbage collector actually deallocates it.</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:14,200 –&gt; 00:10:16,040<br>And this is called the finalization method.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:16,040 –&gt; 00:10:21,200<br>So objects can have finalization methods in Java and those methods are essentially invoked</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:21,200 –&gt; 00:10:22,200<br>by the garbage collector.</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:22,200 –&gt; 00:10:25,400<br>So when the garbage collector discovers that some object is garbage and it’s going to clean</p>
<p>171<br>00:10:25,400 –&gt; 00:10:28,720<br>it up, it’ll first invoke the finalization method.</p>
<p>172<br>00:10:28,720 –&gt; 00:10:30,280<br>And why would you want to do this?</p>
<p>173<br>00:10:30,559 –&gt; 00:10:35,919<br>Well, let’s say we have an object and it might have say a file handle.</p>
<p>174<br>00:10:35,919 –&gt; 00:10:39,559<br>It might have a pointer to an open file or something like that.</p>
<p>175<br>00:10:39,559 –&gt; 00:10:44,240<br>And now when this object becomes unreachable, it will be collected by the garbage collector.</p>
<p>176<br>00:10:44,240 –&gt; 00:10:47,839<br>But if you don’t close the file, well, that’s going to cause problems having lots of open</p>
<p>177<br>00:10:47,839 –&gt; 00:10:53,039<br>files that are hanging around with the program using them, it can cause problems later on,</p>
<p>178<br>00:10:53,039 –&gt; 00:10:54,839<br>especially if you run out of file handles.</p>
<p>179<br>00:10:54,839 –&gt; 00:10:59,720<br>Usually there’s a fixed number of file handles available from the operating system.</p>
<p>180<br>00:10:59,720 –&gt; 00:11:03,560<br>So the right thing to do is when this is garbage collector is to first close the file and</p>
<p>181<br>00:11:03,560 –&gt; 00:11:09,240<br>essentially get rid of this pointer and then deallocate the object.</p>
<p>182<br>00:11:09,240 –&gt; 00:11:11,480<br>And that is what the object finalization is for.</p>
<p>183<br>00:11:11,480 –&gt; 00:11:17,080<br>So again, you can define a method in Java that will be run by the garbage collector to kind</p>
<p>184<br>00:11:17,080 –&gt; 00:11:22,279<br>of clean up any resources the object has before it’s actually deallocated.</p>
<p>185<br>00:11:22,279 –&gt; 00:11:26,440<br>And now the question is, if that finalization method raises an exception, who catches it?</p>
<p>186<br>00:11:26,440 –&gt; 00:11:30,560<br>Because it was invoked by the garbage collector, it’s unpredictable when it’s going to be invoked.</p>
<p>187<br>00:11:30,560 –&gt; 00:11:34,120<br>And it’s not clear where that exception should be handled.</p>
<p>188<br>00:11:34,120 –&gt; 00:11:41,400<br>And the answer to the question is no one handles that method or nothing handles that method.</p>
<p>189<br>00:11:41,400 –&gt; 00:11:43,840<br>Exception is simply dropped.</p>
<p>190<br>00:11:43,840 –&gt; 00:11:49,320<br>And so any exceptions that happen during object finalizations that are not handled within the finalization method</p>
<p>191<br>00:11:49,320 –&gt; 00:11:51,520<br>itself are simply thrown away.</p>
<p>192<br>00:11:52,519 –&gt; 00:11:59,039<br>One of the nice innovations in Java is that exceptions are actually part of the method interface</p>
<p>193<br>00:11:59,039 –&gt; 00:12:01,519<br>and they are checked by the compiler.</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:01,519 –&gt; 00:12:07,279<br>So in the example that I gave at the beginning of this lecture, we had a method x that could raise</p>
<p>195<br>00:12:07,279 –&gt; 00:12:12,879<br>an exception by exception and notice that the declaration of x actually declares that x can throw</p>
<p>196<br>00:12:12,879 –&gt; 00:12:18,319<br>that exception. So it’s part of the interface to x, part of the checked interface to x that it can</p>
<p>197<br>00:12:18,320 –&gt; 00:12:22,000<br>raise a particular exception. And now why would you want to check this at compile time?</p>
<p>198<br>00:12:22,000 –&gt; 00:12:28,480<br>Well, the observation that was made actually in the original Java project was that there were many</p>
<p>199<br>00:12:28,480 –&gt; 00:12:33,920<br>exceptions that could be raised by Java programs and people easily lost track of what possible</p>
<p>200<br>00:12:33,920 –&gt; 00:12:37,520<br>exceptions could be raised. They didn’t know what exceptions they had to handle.</p>
<p>201<br>00:12:37,520 –&gt; 00:12:43,120<br>And in fact, when they added this to the language, the compiler would actually enforce now</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:43,120 –&gt; 00:12:46,160<br>that a method declared every exception it could raise.</p>
<p>203<br>00:12:46,159 –&gt; 00:12:52,399<br>They discovered lots of places in the compiler where there were exceptions being raised but not</p>
<p>204<br>00:12:52,399 –&gt; 00:12:58,799<br>properly handled it. So this led to better air handling in the Java compiler itself.</p>
<p>205<br>00:12:58,799 –&gt; 00:13:05,839<br>And I think people generally agree that this has been a good idea because it helps programmers</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:05,839 –&gt; 00:13:10,639<br>to write more robust code because they can see exactly which exceptions they have to handle.</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:10,639 –&gt; 00:13:16,639<br>Now there are some exceptions to this rule. In particular, there are some kinds of runtime</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:16,639 –&gt; 00:13:22,480<br>errors that don’t have to be part of the method signature simply because it’s very hard to check</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:22,480 –&gt; 00:13:27,039<br>statically that the method would never raise them. So things like irreferencing null or integer overflow</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:28,000 –&gt; 00:13:34,080<br>don’t have to be handled and declared in the interface. But for the most part, any exception</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:34,960 –&gt; 00:13:42,240<br>that a method can raise has to be declared as part of its interface in Java. And then there are</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:42,240 –&gt; 00:13:47,600<br>other mundane type rules about the particular design for exceptions in Java. So for example,</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:47,600 –&gt; 00:13:53,280<br>throw has to be applied to an object of type exception. It can’t be applied to an object of an</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:53,280 –&gt; 00:13:59,280<br>arbitrary type. But overall, exceptions are rather nicely done in Java and this particular idea</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:59,279 –&gt; 00:14:13,439<br>of declaring the types of the exceptions that a method can raise was a new idea in Java.</p>
