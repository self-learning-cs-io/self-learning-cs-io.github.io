                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,480<br>Welcome back. In this video, I’m going to show how to use regular expressions to specify</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,480 –&gt; 00:00:07,000<br>different aspects of programming languages.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:07,000 –&gt; 00:00:14,640<br>Let’s begin with the keywords. This is a relatively simple case, and I’ll just do it for</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,640 –&gt; 00:00:19,199<br>three keywords. I’ll write a regular expression for if, else, or then. It’ll be obvious how</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,199 –&gt; 00:00:26,320<br>to do it for more. Let’s write a regular expression for if, and that would be the regular expression</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:26,320 –&gt; 00:00:32,240<br>for I, and followed by the regular expression for if, and we’re taking the concatenation</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,240 –&gt; 00:00:37,840<br>of these two. Then we’re going to union that with the regular expression for else, and</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:37,840 –&gt; 00:00:41,700<br>what is that? Well, else consists of four individual characters, so we have to write</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,700 –&gt; 00:00:48,920<br>out the concatenation of those four characters. As you can see, this is a little bit verbose</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:48,920 –&gt; 00:00:54,519<br>with all of these quotes and kind of messy to read. In fact, there’s a shorthand that’s</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:54,520 –&gt; 00:00:59,960<br>normally used, and let me switch over to that right now. If I want to write the regular</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,960 –&gt; 00:01:05,840<br>expression for a sequence of single character expressions, I could just put quotes around</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:05,840 –&gt; 00:01:11,200<br>the outermost characters in the sequence. For example, most of the tools will let you write</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:11,200 –&gt; 00:01:15,560<br>this. I put a quote at the beginning, I write IF, and I write closed quote, and this means</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:15,560 –&gt; 00:01:20,840<br>exactly the same thing as this. This is the concatenation of two single character regular</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:20,840 –&gt; 00:01:30,560<br>expressions, and similarly for else, and similarly for then. If I have more keywords,</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:30,560 –&gt; 00:01:38,600<br>I just write them out and union them all together. Now let’s consider a slightly more complicated</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:38,600 –&gt; 00:01:44,560<br>example. Now let’s think about how to specify the integers, which we want to be the non-empty</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:44,560 –&gt; 00:01:49,159<br>strings of digits. So the first problem here is to write out what a digit is, and that’s</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:49,159 –&gt; 00:01:55,359<br>pretty straightforward. A digit is just any of the individual characters 0 through 9,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:55,359 –&gt; 00:02:01,359<br>and we already know how to write out single character regular expressions. It’s just</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:01,359 –&gt; 00:02:09,840<br>a union of 10 of those to specify this, and it’ll take me just a moment to finish. There</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:09,840 –&gt; 00:02:16,120<br>we go. So that’s a regular expression for the set of strings corresponding to all the</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:16,120 –&gt; 00:02:22,240<br>single digits, and because we’ll want to refer to this from time to time, and also because</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:22,240 –&gt; 00:02:26,800<br>there’s a very common thing to want to do, most tools have a facility for naming regular</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:26,800 –&gt; 00:02:33,200<br>expressions. So for example, I can name this one to be digit. So a single digit is anything</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:33,200 –&gt; 00:02:40,080<br>that is generated or is in the set to note it by this regular expression. Now what we want</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:40,080 –&gt; 00:02:47,080<br>to do is to have multiple digits. Well, we know a way to do that. We can just iterate</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:47,080 –&gt; 00:02:52,400<br>a single digit as many times as we like, and so here we get all strings, all possible strings</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:52,400 –&gt; 00:02:58,320<br>of digits. And this is very, very close to what we want to accept that. The string that</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:58,320 –&gt; 00:03:05,320<br>we want has to be non-empty. We don’t want to count the empty string as an integer. And</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:05,719 –&gt; 00:03:12,159<br>that’s an easy way to do that. We just say that the whole sequence has to begin with a single</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:12,159 –&gt; 00:03:18,759<br>digit, and then it’s followed by zero or more additional digits. So just to reiterate</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:18,759 –&gt; 00:03:23,240<br>that, we say there has to be at least one digit, and then it’s followed by zero more additional</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:23,240 –&gt; 00:03:28,719<br>digits. And this pattern actually, for a given language, is extremely common. So if I want</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:28,719 –&gt; 00:03:36,879<br>to say that I have at least one A, I write that as A star, because this says zero or more</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:36,879 –&gt; 00:03:41,079<br>A. The second part says zero or more A’s, and the first part says it has to be at least</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:41,079 –&gt; 00:03:46,360<br>one A. And because this is so common, there’s a shorthand for it, I think it’s supported</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:46,360 –&gt; 00:03:52,680<br>by every regular expression processor, and that is to write A plus. And A plus means</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:52,680 –&gt; 00:03:58,520<br>is just a shorthand for A A star. And so we can actually simplify this regular expression</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:58,520 –&gt; 00:04:09,200<br>a bit and write simply digit plus. Now let’s look at yet another example, even more sophisticated,</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:09,200 –&gt; 00:04:14,480<br>than the previous two. Let’s think about how to define the identifiers, which are strings of</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:14,480 –&gt; 00:04:20,920<br>letters or digits that begin with a letter. And so we already know how to do digits. So let’s focus</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:20,920 –&gt; 00:04:26,120<br>on the letters for a moment. So how will we write out a regular expression for the letters? Well,</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:26,120 –&gt; 00:04:30,759<br>we’re going to want to name it. So we’ll say that the letters are actually a single letter.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:30,759 –&gt; 00:04:36,840<br>And now we have to write a regular expression for all the individual letters. And that’s</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:36,840 –&gt; 00:04:45,240<br>you know, straightforward, but tedious. We have to say little A, lowercase B, lowercase C,</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:45,240 –&gt; 00:04:50,000<br>lowercase D. And well, as you can see, this is going to be rather a large regular expression.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:50,000 –&gt; 00:04:55,280<br>We’re going to have 26 lowercase letters and 26 uppercase letters. And the whole thing</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:55,279 –&gt; 00:05:02,719<br>is going to be rather tedious to write down. So let’s actually not do that. Instead, let me mention a</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:02,719 –&gt; 00:05:08,239<br>shorthand that the tool support to make it easier to write out exactly this kind of regular expression,</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:08,239 –&gt; 00:05:14,479<br>which is called a character range. So inside of square brackets, I can write a range of characters. So how do I do</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:14,479 –&gt; 00:05:20,239<br>that? Well, I have a starting character and an ending character. And I separate them by a hyphen. And what this</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:20,240 –&gt; 00:05:26,000<br>means is the union of all the single character regular expressions beginning with the first character</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:26,000 –&gt; 00:05:30,720<br>and ending with the second character. So everything in between. So this is exactly the regular expression</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:30,720 –&gt; 00:05:35,840<br>for all the lowercase letters. And then I can have another character range inside the same square</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:35,840 –&gt; 00:05:43,040<br>brackets for all the uppercase letters. So capital A through capital Z. Okay. And this regular</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:43,040 –&gt; 00:05:49,199<br>expression here on the right defines exactly the big union that I didn’t want to write out. Okay.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:49,199 –&gt; 00:05:53,519<br>And that gives us a definition of a single letter. And now we’re in great shape. We already have a</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:53,519 –&gt; 00:05:59,199<br>definition for a digit. We already, now we have definition for letter. And so that we can write out</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:59,199 –&gt; 00:06:05,919<br>the rest of this definition. So we want the whole regular expression to always begin with a letter. Okay.</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:05,919 –&gt; 00:06:12,719<br>So identify, always begins with a letter. And after that, it’s allowed to be a string of letters or digits. Okay.</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:12,720 –&gt; 00:06:19,760<br>So the OR suggests that there’s going to be a union. So after the first letter, we can have either a</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:19,760 –&gt; 00:06:26,960<br>letter or a digit. And then we can have an arbitrary string of those things. So we put a star on the</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:26,960 –&gt; 00:06:31,680<br>whole thing. And that is the definition of an identifier begins with a single letter. And it’s followed</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:31,680 –&gt; 00:06:41,200<br>by zero or more letters and digits. Now, because we’re doing a complete laxical specification,</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:41,199 –&gt; 00:06:48,479<br>we also have to deal with even the parts of the string that we’re not really interested in. We have</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:48,479 –&gt; 00:06:52,240<br>to have at least a specification of them so that we can recognize them and throw them away. In</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:52,240 –&gt; 00:06:57,519<br>particular, we have to be able to recognize the white space. And we’re going to just take white</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:57,519 –&gt; 00:07:02,319<br>space to be a non-empty sequence of blanks, new lines, and tabs, even though there are other</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:02,319 –&gt; 00:07:06,319<br>kinds of white space characters, things that may be like rub out, depending on your keyboard,</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:06,319 –&gt; 00:07:10,959<br>there might be others. But these three will suffice to illustrate all the important points.</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:10,959 –&gt; 00:07:17,359<br>So a blank is relatively easy to write down. That’s just single quotes around a blank space.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:17,359 –&gt; 00:07:23,599<br>But there’s a problem with new line and tab. Because a new line, a carriage return in the file,</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:24,159 –&gt; 00:07:29,839<br>has special meaning, typically. In the line, you end whatever command you’re working on in these</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:29,839 –&gt; 00:07:36,079<br>regular expression tools, lexical tools. And a tab also is not an easy thing to write down,</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:36,079 –&gt; 00:07:40,560<br>and it doesn’t look much different from a blank in a lot of cases. So what tools do is they</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:40,560 –&gt; 00:07:46,560<br>provide a separate name for these. And typically, it’s done by having some kind of escape character,</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:47,439 –&gt; 00:07:54,000<br>and a backslash is the most common one that’s used. And then followed by a name for the character.</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:54,800 –&gt; 00:08:00,480<br>Backslash N is typically used for new line and backslash T is typically used for tabs.</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:01,360 –&gt; 00:08:04,639<br>And I just want to stress, I mean, the reason for doing this example is to illustrate this,</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:05,120 –&gt; 00:08:11,360<br>that we have to have a way of naming some characters that don’t really have a very nice print</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:11,360 –&gt; 00:08:16,479<br>representation. There are other characters that don’t even have really any kind of print</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:16,479 –&gt; 00:08:20,319<br>representation. And we still need a way to talk about them in our regular expressions,</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:20,319 –&gt; 00:08:26,399<br>because they might be embedded in a file that we have to electrically analyze at some point.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:26,399 –&gt; 00:08:32,000<br>And so anyway, the way this is done is by providing a separate naming scheme for such</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:32,000 –&gt; 00:08:37,200<br>unprintable characters. And typically it’s done with an escape sequence. So something beginning</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:37,200 –&gt; 00:08:41,919<br>with a special character like backslash followed by the name of the character. So N for new line,</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:41,919 –&gt; 00:08:47,600<br>this case, and T for tab. And so to finish off our definition, this gives us one character white</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:47,600 –&gt; 00:08:53,440<br>space, and then we want a non-MP sequence of such things. So we wrap the whole union there</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:53,440 –&gt; 00:08:57,840<br>in parentheses and put a plus on it, and that gets us what we want.</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:58,320 –&gt; 00:09:06,560<br>Let’s pause for a moment in discussing programming languages and look at another example of using</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:06,560 –&gt; 00:09:12,240<br>regular expressions from a different domain. Here I have an email address, and as it turns out,</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:12,240 –&gt; 00:09:17,840<br>email addresses form a regular language, and every email processing device in the world, so your</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:17,840 –&gt; 00:09:25,519<br>mailer and the mail servers that you use, all do regular expression processing to understand what</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:25,519 –&gt; 00:09:32,319<br>the email address is telling them in the email messages that go by. And so we can think of an</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:32,319 –&gt; 00:09:38,159<br>email address as consisting of four different strings separated by punctuation. There’s a user name,</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:38,159 –&gt; 00:09:45,120<br>and then three parts to the domain. And let’s just assume for simplicity that these strings only</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:45,120 –&gt; 00:09:50,159<br>consist of letters, and practice they can consist of other kinds of characters too, but let’s just</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:50,159 –&gt; 00:09:54,720<br>keep things simple. And we can write out the more complicated thing using regular expressions,</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:54,720 –&gt; 00:10:00,240<br>but the structure will be the same as if we just consider them to be made of letters. And then</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:00,240 –&gt; 00:10:06,639<br>these four strings are separated by punctuation. So there’s the at sign and two decimal points that</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:08,240 –&gt; 00:10:12,240<br>form the separators of the strings. And so this is a relatively straightforward thing to write</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:12,240 –&gt; 00:10:20,000<br>a regular expression for, given what we know so far. So the user name would be a non-MP sequence of</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:20,000 –&gt; 00:10:25,759<br>letters, and then that would be followed by an at sign. And then the first part of the domain</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:26,480 –&gt; 00:10:32,720<br>would also be a non-MP sequence of letters followed by a dot. And then the rest is just the same.</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:38,080 –&gt; 00:10:43,919<br>Okay, so here very quite concisely we have specified large family of email addresses. As I said</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:44,639 –&gt; 00:10:48,960<br>in reality, the email addresses are slightly more complicated, but they can be written out with a</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:48,960 –&gt; 00:10:51,600<br>just a slightly more complicated regular expression.</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:55,200 –&gt; 00:11:01,519<br>Finally, for our last example, let’s look at a fragment of the lexical specification of a real</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:01,519 –&gt; 00:11:07,600<br>programming language. In this case, that language is Pascal, which is in the alcohol family of</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:07,600 –&gt; 00:11:13,440<br>languages. Pascal is an early example of a type language, and it’s in the same general family as</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:13,520 –&gt; 00:11:21,360<br>Portran and C. And this particular fragment of Pascal deals with the definition of numbers.</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:21,360 –&gt; 00:11:25,440<br>And so let’s take a look here. I’ll start at the bottom and look at what the overall definition</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:25,440 –&gt; 00:11:33,920<br>of a number is. So a number consists of three things, some digits, and I’ll just read out this</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:33,920 –&gt; 00:11:39,360<br>abbreviation, an optional fraction, and an optional exponent. So we’re dealing here with floating</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:39,440 –&gt; 00:11:46,480<br>point numbers. And so a floating point number can have a bunch of digits, and then it can be followed</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:46,480 –&gt; 00:11:51,680<br>possibly by a fraction or not, and that can be followed possibly by an exponent or not.</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:53,519 –&gt; 00:11:57,519<br>And the idea, although we can’t see it just from this particular definition, is that either the</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:57,519 –&gt; 00:12:03,440<br>fraction or the exponent can be present independent of the other. So now let’s work briefly from</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:03,440 –&gt; 00:12:08,560<br>the bottom up. Let’s just check that digits are what we expect. So a single digit is in fact the</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:08,559 –&gt; 00:12:14,399<br>union of all the common digits, just as we would hope. And then a non-empty sequence of digits</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:14,399 –&gt; 00:12:19,679<br>is a digit plus. So this is what we’ve already seen. And now the interesting bit is to look at how</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:19,679 –&gt; 00:12:24,639<br>the optional fraction and the optional exponent are defined. And the optional fraction looks a little</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:24,639 –&gt; 00:12:31,759<br>less scary. So let’s do that one first. So what’s going on inside the fraction? Well, if we have a</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:31,759 –&gt; 00:12:36,319<br>decimal fraction, there’s going to be a decimal point, and that’s going to be followed by a string</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:36,320 –&gt; 00:12:41,280<br>of digits. So this is just the fractional parts of the floating point number, so stuff that comes</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:41,280 –&gt; 00:12:47,440<br>after the decimal point. And what’s this plus epsilon doing out here? Well, remember the plus</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:47,440 –&gt; 00:12:54,080<br>is union, and epsilon stands for the empty string. So what this is saying is that either the</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:54,080 –&gt; 00:12:59,600<br>fractional portion of the number is present, or it’s completely absent. So this is how you say</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:59,600 –&gt; 00:13:05,680<br>something is optional. You write out the regular expression for the thing, and then you do plus</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:05,679 –&gt; 00:13:10,879<br>epsilon at the end, and that means, well, either everything I said before can be there, or nothing</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:10,879 –&gt; 00:13:17,279<br>is there. Okay? And the optional exponent is structured similarly, but it’s somewhat more complex.</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:18,000 –&gt; 00:13:22,319<br>So you can see that the whole exponent is optional, because there’s some regular expression here</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:23,759 –&gt; 00:13:29,439<br>that’s unioned with epsilon. And so either something is there, and this is the optional,</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:29,439 –&gt; 00:13:34,079<br>this is the exponent part, or it’s not present at all. And now let’s look inside at how the</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:34,160 –&gt; 00:13:41,120<br>exponent is defined if it’s there. So an exponent always begins with E. So this is a standard</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:41,120 –&gt; 00:13:47,440<br>exponent notation, and it always has a non-empty string of digits. So there’s E followed by some</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:47,440 –&gt; 00:13:52,800<br>digits, and in between, there’s an optional sign. We know the sign is optional, because epsilon is</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:52,800 –&gt; 00:14:00,000<br>one of the possibilities. The whole sign might be absent, and then what are the possibilities for</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:00,080 –&gt; 00:14:04,720<br>the sign? Well, it could be negative, or it could be positive. So either there’s a positive or negative</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:04,720 –&gt; 00:14:11,360<br>sign, or no sign, in which case, presumably it’s interpreted to be positive. Now this idiom,</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:12,080 –&gt; 00:14:17,440<br>where we have plus epsilon, indicates that something is optional, is also extremely common.</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:17,440 –&gt; 00:14:22,720<br>And so there’s another shorthand that many tools provide. So another way of writing this, that’s</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:23,680 –&gt; 00:14:33,840<br>common, is to say that that’s my fractional component, and then it might be absent. So the question</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:33,840 –&gt; 00:14:40,160<br>mark after a regular expression just means exactly this construction. We take that regular expression,</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:40,160 –&gt; 00:14:46,560<br>and we or it with epsilon. And so this one, this regular expression, is a little more complicated,</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:46,560 –&gt; 00:14:50,639<br>has two optional components. So let’s just write out what that would look like. So we would have</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:51,519 –&gt; 00:14:59,919<br>the exponent begins with E, and then we have a sign, which is either plus or minus, and that’s</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:59,919 –&gt; 00:15:06,720<br>optional. So we put a question mark after it, followed by a non-empty-springer digits,</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:06,720 –&gt; 00:15:11,759<br>and then this whole thing is optional. The whole exponent is optional. So this is an alternative</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:11,759 –&gt; 00:15:19,840<br>and more compact way to write this expression. To wrap up, I hope I’ve convinced you in this video</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:19,840 –&gt; 00:15:24,480<br>that regular expressions can describe many useful languages. We’ve seen some fragments from</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:24,480 –&gt; 00:15:30,800<br>programming languages, but also we saw that email addresses could be specified this way. Other</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:30,800 –&gt; 00:15:39,440<br>things that are regular languages are things like phone numbers, and file names are also regular.</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:39,440 –&gt; 00:15:44,720<br>And there are many, many other examples in everyday life where regular languages are used to</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:44,720 –&gt; 00:15:52,000<br>describe some simple set of strings. And I also want to emphasize it so far, we’ve used regular</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:52,000 –&gt; 00:15:57,120<br>languages as a language specification. We used it to define the set of strings we’re interested in,</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:57,120 –&gt; 00:16:03,040<br>but we haven’t said anything about how to actually implement lexical analysis. We still need an</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:03,040 –&gt; 00:16:08,560<br>implementation. And that’s what we’ll talk about in future videos. In particular, in particular,</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:08,560 –&gt; 00:16:13,600<br>we’re going to look at the problem of given a string as in a regular expression R, how do we know</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:13,600 –&gt; 00:16:26,000<br>whether that string is in the language of the regular expression R?</p>
