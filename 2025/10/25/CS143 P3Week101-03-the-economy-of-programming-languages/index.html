                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,080<br>Hello, in this video we’re going to talk about something that I refer to as the economy</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,080 –&gt; 00:00:16,480<br>of programming languages.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,480 –&gt; 00:00:20,879<br>So the idea behind this video is that before we get into the details of how languages are</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:20,879 –&gt; 00:00:27,800<br>implemented or designed, I want to say something about how languages work in the real world</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:27,800 –&gt; 00:00:31,280<br>and why certain languages are used and others are not.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:31,280 –&gt; 00:00:35,200<br>And if you look around, there’s actually a few obvious questions that come up to anybody</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:35,200 –&gt; 00:00:39,399<br>who thinks about programming languages for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:39,399 –&gt; 00:00:41,960<br>One question is, why are there so many of these things?</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,960 –&gt; 00:00:43,920<br>We have hundreds.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:43,920 –&gt; 00:00:48,920<br>If not thousands of programming languages in everyday use, and why do all of these things</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,920 –&gt; 00:00:49,920<br>need to exist?</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:49,920 –&gt; 00:00:53,159<br>Why wouldn’t one programming language, for example, be enough?</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:53,159 –&gt; 00:00:57,359<br>A related question, but slightly different, is why are there new programming languages?</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:57,359 –&gt; 00:01:03,439<br>Given that we have so many programming languages already, what is the need for new ones</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:03,439 –&gt; 00:01:05,799<br>to be created?</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:05,799 –&gt; 00:01:09,159<br>And finally, how do we know a good programming language when we see it?</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:09,159 –&gt; 00:01:12,680<br>What makes a good programming language and what makes a bad programming language?</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:12,680 –&gt; 00:01:19,159<br>And I just want to spend this video anyway, talking about these three questions.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:19,159 –&gt; 00:01:24,400<br>And as we’ll see, I think the answers to these questions are largely independent of the</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:24,400 –&gt; 00:01:33,800<br>technical aspects of language design and implementation, but very interesting in their own right.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:33,800 –&gt; 00:01:37,760<br>So let’s begin with the question of why there are so many programming languages.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:37,760 –&gt; 00:01:42,080<br>And at least a partial answer to this question is not too hard to come by.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:42,080 –&gt; 00:01:46,040<br>If you think for a few minutes, you’d realize that the application domains for programming</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:46,040 –&gt; 00:01:49,920<br>have very distinctive and conflicting needs.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:49,920 –&gt; 00:01:56,640<br>It is very hard to design one language that would actually do everything in every situation</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:56,640 –&gt; 00:01:58,760<br>for all programmers.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:58,760 –&gt; 00:02:01,120<br>And let’s just go through some examples.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:01,120 –&gt; 00:02:09,000<br>One domain that you might not think about very much is scientific computing.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:09,000 –&gt; 00:02:15,000<br>So these are all the big calculations that are done for engineering applications primarily,</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:15,000 –&gt; 00:02:23,000<br>but also big science and long running experiments, simulation experiments.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:23,000 –&gt; 00:02:26,400<br>And what are the needs for such computations?</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:26,400 –&gt; 00:02:30,280<br>Well, typically you need very good floating point support.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:30,280 –&gt; 00:02:32,599<br>I’ll abbreviate that as FP.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:32,599 –&gt; 00:02:40,360<br>You need good support for arrays and operations on arrays, because the most common data type</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:40,360 –&gt; 00:02:45,320<br>in most scientific applications is large arrays of floating point numbers.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:45,320 –&gt; 00:02:49,240<br>And you also need parallelism.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:49,240 –&gt; 00:02:51,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:51,240 –&gt; 00:02:57,400<br>Today to get sufficient performance, you really have to exploit parallelism in these applications.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:57,400 –&gt; 00:03:01,040<br>And not every language actually supports all of these things well.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:01,040 –&gt; 00:03:04,360<br>This is actually not an exhaustive list of the things you need, but it’s a few distinctive</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:04,360 –&gt; 00:03:06,440<br>things that are needed.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:06,439 –&gt; 00:03:11,159<br>But one language that has traditionally done a very good job of supporting these things</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:11,159 –&gt; 00:03:12,560<br>is Fortran.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:12,560 –&gt; 00:03:16,079<br>And Fortran is still heavily used in the scientific community.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:16,079 –&gt; 00:03:23,479<br>It was originally designed for scientific applications, if you recall, the name means formula translation.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:23,479 –&gt; 00:03:26,079<br>And it has evolved over time.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:26,079 –&gt; 00:03:30,360<br>It doesn’t really look much like the original language anymore, but it’s always retained</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:30,360 –&gt; 00:03:35,479<br>this core constituency in scientific computing and remains one of the leading languages in</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:35,479 –&gt; 00:03:36,479<br>that domain.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:36,479 –&gt; 00:03:47,319<br>Now, a completely different kind of domain is business applications.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:47,319 –&gt; 00:03:48,319<br>And so what do you need here?</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:48,319 –&gt; 00:03:52,639<br>Well, so here you’re going to need things like persistence.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:52,639 –&gt; 00:03:54,239<br>You don’t want to lose your data.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:54,239 –&gt; 00:03:59,679<br>You know, businesses go to a lot of trouble to get the data, and they need a way to hold</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:59,679 –&gt; 00:04:00,679<br>on to it.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:00,679 –&gt; 00:04:03,799<br>You know, and they want that to be extremely reliable.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:03,800 –&gt; 00:04:06,880<br>You’re going to need good report facilities.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:06,880 –&gt; 00:04:12,480<br>It’s typically you want to do something with the data, so you need good facilities for</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:12,480 –&gt; 00:04:15,040<br>report generation.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:15,040 –&gt; 00:04:17,800<br>And also, you want to be able to exploit the data.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:17,800 –&gt; 00:04:22,480<br>The data is actually in many modern businesses, one of the most valuable assets.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:22,480 –&gt; 00:04:26,720<br>And so you need good facilities for asking questions about your data.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:26,720 –&gt; 00:04:28,319<br>Let’s call it data analysis.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:28,719 –&gt; 00:04:34,639<br>And again, this is not an exhaustive list of things that you need, but it is representative,</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:34,639 –&gt; 00:04:35,639<br>I would say.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:35,639 –&gt; 00:04:42,079<br>And probably the most common or one of the most common, we used languages for this class</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:42,079 –&gt; 00:04:46,240<br>of applications is SQL, the database query language.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:46,240 –&gt; 00:04:52,120<br>So relational databases and their associated programming language languages, I should say,</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:52,120 –&gt; 00:04:59,120<br>but most notably SQL really dominate in this application domain.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:59,120 –&gt; 00:05:06,639<br>And then another domain, let’s do one more, is systems programming.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:06,639 –&gt; 00:05:12,519<br>So by this, I mean things like embedded systems, things to control devices, operating systems,</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:12,519 –&gt; 00:05:13,519<br>things like that.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:13,519 –&gt; 00:05:15,519<br>And what are the characteristics here?</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:15,519 –&gt; 00:05:19,680<br>Well, we need very low level control of the resources.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:19,680 –&gt; 00:05:24,240<br>The whole point of systems programming is to do a good job of managing resources.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:24,240 –&gt; 00:05:29,840<br>And so we really want fine grain control over the resources.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:29,840 –&gt; 00:05:32,319<br>And often there’s a time aspect.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:32,319 –&gt; 00:05:41,040<br>So you might be have some real time constraints, you need to be able to reason about time.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:41,040 –&gt; 00:05:46,439<br>Because these are actually, again, devices and they need to be able to react with certain</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:46,439 –&gt; 00:05:47,439<br>amounts of time.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:47,439 –&gt; 00:05:51,839<br>If it’s a network device or something like that, you need to be responsive to the network.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:51,839 –&gt; 00:05:56,120<br>Lots and lots of things, lots and lots of examples where timing is important.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:56,120 –&gt; 00:06:00,759<br>These are just two aspects and I’m running out of space here, so I’ll just stop with that.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:00,759 –&gt; 00:06:05,920<br>But again, these are representative of the kinds of things you need in systems programming.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:05,920 –&gt; 00:06:10,519<br>And probably today, still the most widely used systems programming language or family</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:10,519 –&gt; 00:06:19,159<br>of systems programming languages is the C and some extent C++ family of languages.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:19,159 –&gt; 00:06:23,680<br>And as you can see, the requirements in these different domains are just completely different</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:23,680 –&gt; 00:06:24,680<br>from each other.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:24,680 –&gt; 00:06:28,839<br>What’s important in one domain or most important in one domain is not the same as in another</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:28,839 –&gt; 00:06:29,839<br>domain.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:29,839 –&gt; 00:06:34,000<br>And it’s easy, I think, to imagine at least that it would be difficult to integrate all</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:34,000 –&gt; 00:06:43,759<br>of these into one system that would do a good job on all of these things.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:43,759 –&gt; 00:06:47,279<br>That brings us to our second question, why are there new programming languages?</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:47,279 –&gt; 00:06:48,279<br>Okay?</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:48,279 –&gt; 00:06:53,959<br>There are so many languages in existence, why would we ever need to design a new one?</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:53,959 –&gt; 00:06:58,600<br>And I’m going to begin the answer to this question with an observation that at first a glance</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:58,600 –&gt; 00:07:01,519<br>has nothing to do with the question at all.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:01,519 –&gt; 00:07:03,199<br>So let me just take a moment to explain it.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:03,199 –&gt; 00:07:07,319<br>I claim that programmer training is the dominant cost for programming language.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:07,319 –&gt; 00:07:08,759<br>And I think this is really important.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:08,759 –&gt; 00:07:13,800<br>So I’m just going to emphasize the bit that’s important here.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:13,800 –&gt; 00:07:18,240<br>It’s the programmer training, the cost of educating the programmers in the language.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:18,240 –&gt; 00:07:22,519<br>So if you think about a programming language, there are several things that have to happen</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:22,519 –&gt; 00:07:25,039<br>for that language to get used.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:25,039 –&gt; 00:07:27,719<br>Somebody has to design it, but that’s really not very expensive.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:27,719 –&gt; 00:07:31,279<br>That’s just one or a very few people, typically.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:31,279 –&gt; 00:07:35,879<br>Somebody has to build a compiler, but that is also not actually all that expensive.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:35,879 –&gt; 00:07:42,279<br>Maybe 10 to 20 people for a really large compiler project can build quite a good compiler.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:42,279 –&gt; 00:07:45,319<br>The real cost is in all the users and educating them.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:45,319 –&gt; 00:07:52,079<br>So if you have thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of users of a language, the time</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:52,079 –&gt; 00:07:57,039<br>and money that it takes to teach them all the language is really the dominant cost.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:57,040 –&gt; 00:08:02,319<br>And here I don’t mean just the actual dollar expense of buying textbooks and taking</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:02,319 –&gt; 00:08:04,200<br>classes and things like that.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:04,200 –&gt; 00:08:08,160<br>It’s also the fact that the programmers have to decide that it’s worth it for them to</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:08,160 –&gt; 00:08:13,480<br>learn this language and many programmers learn on their own time, but that’s a use of</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:13,480 –&gt; 00:08:18,480<br>their time and the expense of their time is a real economic cost.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:18,480 –&gt; 00:08:22,320<br>And so if you think about the number of hours that it takes to teach a population of a</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:22,319 –&gt; 00:08:29,759<br>million programmers a language, that’s really quite a significant economic investment.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:29,759 –&gt; 00:08:30,759<br>All right.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:30,759 –&gt; 00:08:35,360<br>Now from this observation, we can make a couple of predictions pretty easily.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:35,360 –&gt; 00:08:42,240<br>And again, these are just predictions now that follow from this claim, if you believe</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:42,240 –&gt; 00:08:44,080<br>that it’s true.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:44,080 –&gt; 00:08:45,480<br>So let me erase that and fix it.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:45,480 –&gt; 00:09:01,600<br>So first prediction is that widely used languages will be slow to change.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:01,600 –&gt; 00:09:02,840<br>And why should that be true?</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:02,840 –&gt; 00:09:09,320<br>Well, if I make a change to a language that lots of people use, I have to educate everybody</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:09,320 –&gt; 00:09:11,320<br>in that community about the change.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:11,320 –&gt; 00:09:18,560<br>And so even relatively minor language extensions, small changes to syntax, small new features,</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:18,560 –&gt; 00:09:21,400<br>even just simple changes in the interface of the compiler.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:21,400 –&gt; 00:09:26,520<br>If you have a lot of users, it takes a very long time and is quite expensive to teach them</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:26,520 –&gt; 00:09:28,160<br>all about that.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:28,160 –&gt; 00:09:34,879<br>So as these languages become widely used, the rate of change, their rate of change will</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:34,879 –&gt; 00:09:36,600<br>slow down.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:36,600 –&gt; 00:09:40,760<br>And this predicts it over time as the world of programming grows as we have more and more</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:40,759 –&gt; 00:09:42,000<br>programmers in the world.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:42,000 –&gt; 00:09:46,399<br>We would expect the most popular languages, which will have larger and larger user bases,</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:46,399 –&gt; 00:09:52,399<br>a larger and larger programmer bases to become more and more ossified, to evolve more</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:52,399 –&gt; 00:09:53,399<br>and more slowly.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:53,399 –&gt; 00:09:59,080<br>And I think actually what you see in practice is very consistent with that prediction.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:59,080 –&gt; 00:10:06,319<br>Now at the other end of the spectrum, this same observation makes almost what appears to</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:06,320 –&gt; 00:10:16,760<br>be contradictory prediction, which is that easy to start, it’s easy to start a new language.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:16,760 –&gt; 00:10:21,040<br>That in fact, the cost of starting up a new language is very low.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:21,040 –&gt; 00:10:22,040<br>And why is that?</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:22,040 –&gt; 00:10:23,560<br>Well, because you start with zero users.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:23,560 –&gt; 00:10:27,160<br>And so there’s essentially zero training cost at the beginning.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:27,160 –&gt; 00:10:32,640<br>And even when you have just a few users, the cost of teaching them the changes in the language</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:32,640 –&gt; 00:10:34,360<br>is not very high.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:34,360 –&gt; 00:10:39,039<br>And so new languages can evolve much more quickly.</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:39,039 –&gt; 00:10:44,560<br>They can adapt much more quickly to changing situations.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:44,560 –&gt; 00:10:50,399<br>And it’s just not very costly to experiment with a new language at all.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:50,399 –&gt; 00:10:54,240<br>And there’s a tension between these two things.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:54,240 –&gt; 00:10:56,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:56,240 –&gt; 00:11:01,560<br>So when is a programmer going to choose between a widely used existing language that perhaps</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:01,560 –&gt; 00:11:03,879<br>doesn’t change very quickly?</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:03,879 –&gt; 00:11:09,080<br>And in a brand new language, well, they’re going to choose it if the productivity, if their</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:09,080 –&gt; 00:11:16,039<br>productivity exceeds the training cost.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:16,039 –&gt; 00:11:21,840<br>So if they perceive that by spending a little bit of time and money to learn this new language,</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:21,840 –&gt; 00:11:25,919<br>they’re going to be much more productive over a relatively short period of time, then</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:25,919 –&gt; 00:11:29,519<br>they’re going to make the switch.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:29,519 –&gt; 00:11:32,360<br>And so when is this likely to happen?</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:32,360 –&gt; 00:11:41,159<br>Well, putting this all together, languages are most likely to be adopted.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:41,159 –&gt; 00:11:47,360<br>It’s a filo void.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:47,360 –&gt; 00:11:48,360<br>Okay.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:48,360 –&gt; 00:11:54,680<br>And again, this is a prediction that follows from the fact that programmer training is the</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:54,680 –&gt; 00:11:55,680<br>main cost.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:55,680 –&gt; 00:11:57,080<br>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:57,480 –&gt; 00:12:03,120<br>Well, what I mean is that programming languages exist for a purpose.</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:03,120 –&gt; 00:12:06,520<br>I mean, people use them to get work done.</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:06,520 –&gt; 00:12:10,800<br>And because we’re still in the middle of the information revolution, there are new application</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:10,800 –&gt; 00:12:12,480<br>domains coming along all the time.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:12,480 –&gt; 00:12:19,120<br>So there are new kinds of programming that emerge every few years or even more often than</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:19,120 –&gt; 00:12:20,120<br>that.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:20,120 –&gt; 00:12:24,680<br>So just in terms of recent history, mobile applications are now something that’s relatively</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:24,680 –&gt; 00:12:25,680<br>new.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:25,679 –&gt; 00:12:29,879<br>And there’s a lot of new technology being built up to support mobile computing.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:29,879 –&gt; 00:12:32,000<br>A few years ago, it was the internet itself.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:32,000 –&gt; 00:12:33,719<br>It was a new programming platform.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:33,719 –&gt; 00:12:39,239<br>And a bunch of new programming languages like Java in particular got started during that</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:39,239 –&gt; 00:12:41,159<br>time.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:41,159 –&gt; 00:12:46,599<br>So new programming niches open up because of technology changes, what people want to do</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:46,599 –&gt; 00:12:48,399<br>with software changes.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:48,399 –&gt; 00:12:51,839<br>And this creates new opportunities for languages.</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:51,840 –&gt; 00:12:54,399<br>The old languages are slow to change.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:54,399 –&gt; 00:13:02,000<br>And so they have some difficulty adapting to fit these new domains.</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:02,000 –&gt; 00:13:05,800<br>And they aren’t really necessarily well suited to them for the reasons we talked about on</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:05,800 –&gt; 00:13:11,000<br>the previous slide with the previous question, because it’s hard to have one language that</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:11,000 –&gt; 00:13:13,879<br>incorporates all the features you would want.</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:13,879 –&gt; 00:13:20,160<br>And so the new languages are not necessarily perfect for these application domains.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:20,159 –&gt; 00:13:24,159<br>They’re slow to adopt, to adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:24,159 –&gt; 00:13:26,439<br>And this tends to call forth new languages.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:26,439 –&gt; 00:13:32,319<br>So when there’s a new opportunity and some application domain, if there are enough programmers</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:32,319 –&gt; 00:13:38,439<br>to support the language, often the new language will arise.</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:38,439 –&gt; 00:13:44,519<br>Just want to point out another prediction that can be made from this one observation that</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:44,519 –&gt; 00:13:45,519<br>programmer training.</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:45,519 –&gt; 00:13:46,879<br>And again, I’ll underline that.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:46,879 –&gt; 00:13:49,279<br>This is the dominant cost for programming language.</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:49,279 –&gt; 00:14:07,039<br>And that is that new languages tend to look like old languages.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:07,039 –&gt; 00:14:10,759<br>That is that new languages are rarely, if ever, completely new.</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:10,759 –&gt; 00:14:17,879<br>They have a family resemblance to some predecessor language, sometimes a number of predecessor</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:17,879 –&gt; 00:14:19,159<br>languages.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:19,159 –&gt; 00:14:20,319<br>And why is that?</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:20,319 –&gt; 00:14:23,720<br>Well, partly that it’s hard to think of truly new things.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:23,720 –&gt; 00:14:28,439<br>But also I think that there’s an economic benefit to this, namely that it reduces the training</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:28,439 –&gt; 00:14:29,439<br>cost.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:29,439 –&gt; 00:14:33,240<br>By having your new language look like an old language, by leveraging off what people already</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:33,240 –&gt; 00:14:37,519<br>know about the old language, you make it easier for people to learn the new language.</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:37,519 –&gt; 00:14:39,519<br>You make them learn it more quickly.</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:39,519 –&gt; 00:14:47,360<br>And the most classic example of this is Java versus C++, where Java was designed to look</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:47,360 –&gt; 00:14:49,639<br>a lot like C++.</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:49,639 –&gt; 00:14:55,759<br>And that was I think very conscious to make it easy for all of the existing C++ programmers</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:55,759 –&gt; 00:15:00,000<br>to start programming in Java.</p>
<p>212<br>00:15:00,000 –&gt; 00:15:05,000<br>Finally, we can ask ourselves what is a good programming language.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:05,000 –&gt; 00:15:09,720<br>And here, unfortunately, the situation is much less clear.</p>
<p>214<br>00:15:09,720 –&gt; 00:15:19,039<br>I would just make one claim that there is no, and I’ll emphasize no, universally accepted</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:19,039 –&gt; 00:15:26,039<br>metric for language design.</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:26,039 –&gt; 00:15:28,159<br>And what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:28,159 –&gt; 00:15:37,879<br>Well, I guess the most important part of this statement is the universally accepted bit.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:37,879 –&gt; 00:15:41,719<br>So I mean that people don’t agree on what makes a good language.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:41,719 –&gt; 00:15:46,120<br>There are lots of metrics out there, and people have proposed lots of ways of measuring</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:46,120 –&gt; 00:15:47,759<br>programming languages.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:47,759 –&gt; 00:15:54,279<br>But most people don’t believe that these are very good measures.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:54,279 –&gt; 00:15:55,799<br>And there is certainly no consensus.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:55,799 –&gt; 00:16:00,079<br>If you just look at the world of programmers, they can’t agree on what the best language</p>
<p>224<br>00:16:00,079 –&gt; 00:16:01,079<br>is.</p>
<p>225<br>00:16:01,079 –&gt; 00:16:04,759<br>And to convince yourselves of this, just go and take a look at any of the many news group</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:04,759 –&gt; 00:16:11,159<br>posts where people get into semi-religious arguments about why one group of languages or</p>
<p>227<br>00:16:11,159 –&gt; 00:16:15,559<br>particular language is better than another language.</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:15,559 –&gt; 00:16:19,799<br>But even in the research community and the scientific community and among the people who</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:19,799 –&gt; 00:16:26,000<br>design languages, I would say that there is no universally accepted consensus on what</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:26,000 –&gt; 00:16:28,079<br>makes a good language.</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:28,079 –&gt; 00:16:31,799<br>And to just kind of illustrate the difficulties in trying to come up with such a metric, let</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:31,799 –&gt; 00:16:36,759<br>me discuss one that I’ve heard people propose in all seriousness.</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:36,759 –&gt; 00:16:50,319<br>And that is that a good language is one people use.</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:50,319 –&gt; 00:16:55,679<br>And let me put a question mark on that because I don’t believe this statement.</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:55,679 –&gt; 00:17:02,240<br>And I think a moment’s reflection, with a moment’s reflection, I can convince you that</p>
<p>236<br>00:17:02,240 –&gt; 00:17:05,079<br>this isn’t a great measure.</p>
<p>237<br>00:17:05,079 –&gt; 00:17:10,159<br>On the positive side, I guess the argument for this is that it’s a very clear measure.</p>
<p>238<br>00:17:10,159 –&gt; 00:17:11,679<br>It measures the popularity of the language.</p>
<p>239<br>00:17:11,679 –&gt; 00:17:13,480<br>So how many people are actually using it?</p>
<p>240<br>00:17:13,480 –&gt; 00:17:19,439<br>And presumably, languages that are more widely used are more widely used for a good reason.</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:19,439 –&gt; 00:17:23,839<br>In some sense, perhaps, they are better languages.</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:23,839 –&gt; 00:17:28,439<br>But this would imply, if you believe this, and follow it to its logical conclusion, that</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:28,439 –&gt; 00:17:35,000<br>visual basic is the best language.</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:35,000 –&gt; 00:17:38,759<br>Of all other programming languages.</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:38,759 –&gt; 00:17:40,119<br>And I have nothing against visual basic.</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:40,119 –&gt; 00:17:42,759<br>It’s a well-designed system.</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:42,759 –&gt; 00:17:48,680<br>But I don’t even think the designers of visual basic would claim that it is, in fact, the</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:48,680 –&gt; 00:17:50,759<br>world’s best programming language.</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:50,759 –&gt; 00:17:56,799<br>And as we saw in the discussion that we just had, there are many, many other factors besides</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:56,799 –&gt; 00:18:03,279<br>technical excellence that go into whether a programming language is widely used or not.</p>
<p>251<br>00:18:03,279 –&gt; 00:18:08,639<br>In fact, technical excellence is probably not even the most important reason that a language</p>
<p>252<br>00:18:08,639 –&gt; 00:18:09,639<br>might be used.</p>
<p>253<br>00:18:09,639 –&gt; 00:18:16,839<br>It has much more to do with whether it addresses a niche or an application domain for which</p>
<p>254<br>00:18:16,839 –&gt; 00:18:18,399<br>there isn’t a better tool.</p>
<p>255<br>00:18:18,399 –&gt; 00:18:21,399<br>And then, once it’s established and has lots of users, of course, there’s a inertia in</p>
<p>256<br>00:18:21,399 –&gt; 00:18:24,079<br>history that aided in surviving.</p>
<p>257<br>00:18:24,079 –&gt; 00:18:30,639<br>That’s why we still have Fortran and Coball and lots of other languages from long, long</p>
<p>258<br>00:18:30,640 –&gt; 00:18:36,920<br>ago that we could, if we were starting over today, design much better.</p>
<p>259<br>00:18:36,920 –&gt; 00:18:40,840<br>So to conclude this video on the Academy of Programming Languages, I think that two</p>
<p>260<br>00:18:40,840 –&gt; 00:18:46,240<br>most important things to remember are that application domains have conflicting needs.</p>
<p>261<br>00:18:46,240 –&gt; 00:18:56,800<br>And therefore, it’s difficult to design one system that incorporates everything that</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:56,800 –&gt; 00:18:59,280<br>you would like to have.</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:59,279 –&gt; 00:19:05,200<br>So you can’t get all the features that you would like into a single system and a coherent</p>
<p>264<br>00:19:05,200 –&gt; 00:19:06,200<br>design.</p>
<p>265<br>00:19:06,200 –&gt; 00:19:07,879<br>At least, it’s very hard to do that.</p>
<p>266<br>00:19:07,879 –&gt; 00:19:14,319<br>And so it takes a lot of time to add new features to existing systems.</p>
<p>267<br>00:19:14,319 –&gt; 00:19:19,879<br>And the second point is that programmer training is the dominant cost for a programming language.</p>
<p>268<br>00:19:19,879 –&gt; 00:19:26,839<br>And together, these two things, these two observations, these really explain why we get</p>
<p>269<br>00:19:26,839 –&gt; 00:19:28,839<br>new programming languages.</p>
<p>270<br>00:19:28,839 –&gt; 00:19:31,119<br>Because the old languages are difficult to change.</p>
<p>271<br>00:19:31,119 –&gt; 00:19:36,759<br>And when we have new opportunities, it’s often easier and more direct to just design a new</p>
<p>272<br>00:19:36,759 –&gt; 00:19:43,319<br>language for those rather than trying to move the entire community of programmers and</p>
<p>273<br>00:19:43,319 –&gt; 00:19:49,799<br>existing systems to accommodate those new applications.</p>
