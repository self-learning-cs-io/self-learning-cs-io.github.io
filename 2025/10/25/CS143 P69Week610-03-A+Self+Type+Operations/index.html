                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,480<br>In this video, we’re going to continue our discussion of self-type by talking about the type</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,480 –&gt; 00:00:11,839<br>level operations that are available on self-type.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,839 –&gt; 00:00:17,280<br>And this will help to clarify what self-type actually is and its role in the type system.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,280 –&gt; 00:00:23,519<br>So, let’s begin by thinking about the example that we discussed last time.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,519 –&gt; 00:00:26,240<br>And if you’ve forgotten what that is, let me just write it down quickly.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:26,239 –&gt; 00:00:29,519<br>We had a class called count.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:29,519 –&gt; 00:00:36,079<br>And count had one field, an integer i, that was initial i as to zero.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:36,079 –&gt; 00:00:42,879<br>And it had one method called ink that returned something of type self-type.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:42,879 –&gt; 00:00:49,959<br>And all ink did was to increment the counterfield and return the self-object.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:49,959 –&gt; 00:00:55,519<br>And I’ve probably made some syntax errors here, but that’s not really important.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:55,520 –&gt; 00:00:58,560<br>That’s the basic code for the count class.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:58,560 –&gt; 00:01:02,480<br>And the question is, what can be the dynamic type of the object that’s actually returned</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,480 –&gt; 00:01:04,359<br>by ink?</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:04,359 –&gt; 00:01:08,719<br>And the answer here is that it could be whatever is the type of the self-object, whatever</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,719 –&gt; 00:01:12,359<br>is the dynamic type of the self-object.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,359 –&gt; 00:01:18,560<br>And if we think about a big program where there’s multiple classes that inherit from count,</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,560 –&gt; 00:01:27,760<br>then the answer is that ink could return count or any subclass of count.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:27,760 –&gt; 00:01:37,439<br>So, I was going to return something that’s at least at most count.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:37,439 –&gt; 00:01:40,719<br>But it could return something more specific, the dynamic type could be something more specific.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:40,719 –&gt; 00:01:46,240<br>It could be a subclass of count or a subclass of a subclass of count.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:46,239 –&gt; 00:01:52,239<br>Anything that inherits directly or indirectly from count is a possibility.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:52,239 –&gt; 00:01:53,239<br>So what’s the general case?</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:53,239 –&gt; 00:02:01,039<br>Well, let’s think about a class C. And in this class C, there’s some expression buried</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:01,039 –&gt; 00:02:04,640<br>somewhere inside of it that has the type self-type.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:04,640 –&gt; 00:02:09,519<br>And it doesn’t really matter how that expression got the type self-type or what it is.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:09,519 –&gt; 00:02:12,479<br>Let’s just say that it has that type somehow.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:13,280 –&gt; 00:02:17,479<br>Well, what are the possible dynamic types of the expression E?</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:17,479 –&gt; 00:02:21,679<br>And from our discussion on the previous slide, it seems clear that the dynamic type of E,</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:21,679 –&gt; 00:02:26,879<br>when you run E, you’re going to get back something that’s a subtype of the class C,</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:26,879 –&gt; 00:02:29,879<br>the enclosing class in which the self-type appears.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:29,879 –&gt; 00:02:36,479<br>And that’s interesting because it shows us that the meaning of self-type actually depends on the context.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:36,479 –&gt; 00:02:41,679<br>So what this self-type means, this self-type means a subtype of the class C.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:41,680 –&gt; 00:02:46,480<br>If I had written self-type in a class D, somewhere in the definition of class D,</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:46,480 –&gt; 00:02:50,680<br>there it would mean a subtype of the class D.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:50,680 –&gt; 00:02:54,680<br>And so to remind ourselves what class we’re talking about,</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:54,680 –&gt; 00:02:59,879<br>what enclosing class we’re talking about, we’re going to subscript occurrences of self-type with a class name.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:59,879 –&gt; 00:03:08,080<br>So self-type sub C here is going to refer to a syntactic occurrence of the keyword self-type in the body of the class C.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:08,080 –&gt; 00:03:14,280<br>And this also suggests a very simple typing rule, and really the first useful fact about self-type,</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:14,280 –&gt; 00:03:18,880<br>which is that self-type sub C is a subtype of C.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:18,880 –&gt; 00:03:27,680<br>And this is really a key idea here that a self-type in class C is some subtype of the class C.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:27,680 –&gt; 00:03:30,880<br>Because this also helps illustrate what self-type really is.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:30,880 –&gt; 00:03:34,880<br>The best way to think of an occurrence of self-type is that it’s a type variable</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:34,879 –&gt; 00:03:39,680<br>that ranges over all the subclasses of the class in which it appears.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:39,680 –&gt; 00:03:42,479<br>So self-type sub C, you should think of as a type variable.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:42,479 –&gt; 00:03:48,079<br>It’s something that doesn’t have a fixed type, but it’s guaranteed to be some type bounded by C.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:48,079 –&gt; 00:03:53,879<br>So it’s going to be only one of the classes that inherits directly or indirectly from the class C.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:56,879 –&gt; 00:04:02,879<br>Now that rule that self-type sub C is a subtype of the class C has an important consequence.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:02,879 –&gt; 00:04:08,079<br>It means that when we’re doing type checking with self-type, it is always safe, always safe,</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:08,079 –&gt; 00:04:10,479<br>to replace self-type sub C by C.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:10,479 –&gt; 00:04:16,879<br>So it’s okay to promote any self-type sub C, which could be C or a subtype of C to just say,</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:16,879 –&gt; 00:04:19,680<br>okay, we’re just going to say that it’s C.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:20,879 –&gt; 00:04:27,680<br>And that suggests one way to handle self-type, which is just to replace all the occurrences of self-type sub C by C.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:27,680 –&gt; 00:04:30,480<br>Now unfortunately, that turns out not to be very useful.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:30,480 –&gt; 00:04:32,480<br>It’s sound, it’s correct to do that.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:32,480 –&gt; 00:04:34,879<br>But that’s really just like not having self-type at all.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:34,879 –&gt; 00:04:41,680<br>That’s as if we went back to the example we did in the last video where we started out without self-type,</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:41,680 –&gt; 00:04:45,280<br>and we found out we couldn’t use inheritance in the way we expected.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:47,680 –&gt; 00:04:50,480<br>So to do better than just throwing all the self-types away,</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:50,480 –&gt; 00:04:53,680<br>we need to incorporate self-type into the type system.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:53,680 –&gt; 00:04:58,879<br>And the way we’re going to do that is by looking at the operations that work on types in the type system.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:58,879 –&gt; 00:05:00,079<br>And there are two of them.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:00,079 –&gt; 00:05:02,879<br>There’s the subtype relationship that we’ve talked about before.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:02,879 –&gt; 00:05:04,879<br>So when one type is a subtype of another,</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:04,879 –&gt; 00:05:09,680<br>and there’s the least upper bound operation that tells us what the smallest type is,</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:09,680 –&gt; 00:05:12,879<br>it’s bigger than both of two argument types.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:12,879 –&gt; 00:05:18,879<br>And all we have to do, what we’re going to do now, is extend these operations to handle the type self-type.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:20,879 –&gt; 00:05:22,879<br>So let’s begin with the subtype relationship.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:22,879 –&gt; 00:05:26,879<br>And in our definition here, we’re going to use some types T and T prime.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:26,879 –&gt; 00:05:31,279<br>And these are just normal class names. They are any class names, but not self-type.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:33,279 –&gt; 00:05:38,079<br>So one possibility is that we have self-type on both sides of our subtype relationship.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:38,079 –&gt; 00:05:45,279<br>And in that case, it’s easy to see that self-type sub-sea should be a subtype of self-type sub-sea.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:45,279 –&gt; 00:05:49,279<br>So to convince yourself of this, think of self-type again as a variable.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:49,279 –&gt; 00:05:53,680<br>And we can plug in for that variable, any subtype of C.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:54,079 –&gt; 00:06:00,079<br>But just like variables in algebra, if we plug in one particular class for an occurrence of this variable,</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:00,079 –&gt; 00:06:02,480<br>we have to pick the same one for every occurrence of the variable.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:02,480 –&gt; 00:06:09,280<br>So in particular, if we pick some subclass A of C, then we wind up with A is a subtype of A.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:09,280 –&gt; 00:06:12,879<br>If we plug in A for both sides, we can see that the relationship holds,</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:12,879 –&gt; 00:06:14,879<br>similarly C is a subtype of C.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:14,879 –&gt; 00:06:18,879<br>And for any other subtype we might pick, if we bind the variable to that subtype,</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:18,879 –&gt; 00:06:21,680<br>we can see that this relationship will be true.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:22,079 –&gt; 00:06:28,480<br>Now, another thing you might think is, well, what if the self-type sub-sea is compared with self-type from another class,</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:28,480 –&gt; 00:06:30,879<br>say, self-types of D?</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:30,879 –&gt; 00:06:34,879<br>And it turns out that in the cool type rules, this will just never come up.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:34,879 –&gt; 00:06:40,879<br>The cool type rules are written in such a way that we never need to compare self-types from different classes.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:40,879 –&gt; 00:06:46,079<br>And I haven’t shown you that that’s the case yet, but when we actually go through the type rules for self-type,</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:46,079 –&gt; 00:06:48,079<br>you will see that it’s true.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:48,479 –&gt; 00:06:55,680<br>Now, another possibility is that we have self-type on one side and then a regular type on the other side.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:55,680 –&gt; 00:06:59,279<br>So when is self-types of C a subtype of T?</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:59,279 –&gt; 00:07:03,680<br>Well, we’re going to say that that’s true if C is a subtype of T.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:03,680 –&gt; 00:07:11,680<br>And here we’re using our rule that it’s always safe to replace self-type by the class that indexes it.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:12,079 –&gt; 00:07:17,879<br>So in this case, you can see it’s in C is a super-type of anything that self-types of C could be.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:17,879 –&gt; 00:07:23,680<br>Clearly, if C is a subtype of T, if T is at least C, or possibly something higher in the class hierarchy,</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:23,680 –&gt; 00:07:28,079<br>then T will be a super-type of anything that self-types of C could stand for.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:30,480 –&gt; 00:07:38,480<br>Another case is when we have a regular class name on the left-hand side of the sub-typing relationship and self-type on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:38,480 –&gt; 00:07:42,879<br>And in this case, it turns out we have to say that this relationship is false.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:42,879 –&gt; 00:07:48,879<br>That so T is never a regular class name is never a subtype of self-type of C.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:48,879 –&gt; 00:07:51,680<br>And to see this, just think about the possibilities.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:51,680 –&gt; 00:07:55,280<br>So where could C and T be in the type hierarchy?</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:55,280 –&gt; 00:08:02,879<br>So if T and C are unrelated, if they are inherent from object and they have nothing to do with each other,</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:03,279 –&gt; 00:08:10,079<br>then clearly T can’t be a subtype of self-type of C. They’re just two unrelated classes.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:10,079 –&gt; 00:08:14,480<br>So the only way that this could possibly work out is if they’re related somehow.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:14,480 –&gt; 00:08:21,279<br>Now, if T is a subtype of C, then you might think that this could work out.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:21,279 –&gt; 00:08:25,680<br>But it turns out that we can’t allow it even in that case.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:25,680 –&gt; 00:08:27,680<br>And here’s the reason why.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:27,680 –&gt; 00:08:31,680<br>Think about a hierarchy where T has some subclass.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:31,680 –&gt; 00:08:35,680<br>Let’s just say that it has a subclass A.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:35,680 –&gt; 00:08:42,480<br>And now, because self-types of C ranges over all the possible subtypes of C,</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:42,480 –&gt; 00:08:49,279<br>we could plug in A here and T is not a subtype of A. They’re in the wrong relationship.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:49,279 –&gt; 00:08:53,680<br>And so because it doesn’t work for all the possible values of subtype sub C,</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:53,679 –&gt; 00:08:57,679<br>we can’t say that this is true. We have to say that it is false.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:57,679 –&gt; 00:09:04,879<br>Now, there is one very special case where one could argue that we should allow this to be true.</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:04,879 –&gt; 00:09:10,879<br>And that is in the case where T is actually a leaf of the class hierarchy.</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:10,879 –&gt; 00:09:15,279<br>And let me actually draw this a little bit differently just to emphasize this.</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:15,279 –&gt; 00:09:19,679<br>Let’s say that C is a class up here and then T,</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:19,679 –&gt; 00:09:24,479<br>you know, through some chain of inheritance relationships, is a subtype of C.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:24,479 –&gt; 00:09:27,679<br>So it’s not immediate, but there might be other classes in between.</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:27,679 –&gt; 00:09:31,679<br>Just emphasize this relationship doesn’t have to be immediate inheritance.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:31,679 –&gt; 00:09:33,679<br>It could be transitive inheritance.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:33,679 –&gt; 00:09:37,679<br>And now, if T is a leaf of the hierarchy,</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:37,679 –&gt; 00:09:43,679<br>and it is the only leaf of C, if C has no other subclasses,</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:43,679 –&gt; 00:09:48,679<br>then in fact, T is a subtype of self-types of C.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:48,679 –&gt; 00:09:56,679<br>Because it is the unique minimal type that is in the subtype hierarchy of C.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:56,679 –&gt; 00:10:01,479<br>But the problem is that this is extremely fragile and doesn’t work if you modify the program.</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:01,479 –&gt; 00:10:06,679<br>In particular, a programmer might come along and add some class A over here</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:06,679 –&gt; 00:10:10,679<br>that’s unrelated to T, but is also a subclass of C.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:10,679 –&gt; 00:10:15,679<br>And now this would no longer work because if I plug in A for self-types of C,</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:15,679 –&gt; 00:10:18,679<br>then I see that T is not a subtype of A.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:18,679 –&gt; 00:10:23,679<br>So we could allow it in the very special case that C had only a chain of inheritance.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:23,679 –&gt; 00:10:28,679<br>It’s not a general tree under it and that T was the leaf of that chain.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:28,679 –&gt; 00:10:31,679<br>But that is so fragile to future program extensions.</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:31,679 –&gt; 00:10:35,679<br>And if you broke it by adding another class over here,</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:35,679 –&gt; 00:10:40,679<br>all of a sudden you would get type errors in pieces of code that had previously been type check to work</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:40,679 –&gt; 00:10:44,679<br>and hadn’t changed at all, it just wouldn’t be a very nice language design.</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:44,679 –&gt; 00:10:50,679<br>So summarize, T is never a subtype of self-types of C.</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:51,679 –&gt; 00:10:56,679<br>And finally, if we’re comparing two normal types with not self-type,</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:56,679 –&gt; 00:10:58,679<br>then we just use the rules that we gave before.</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:58,679 –&gt; 00:11:03,679<br>So the sub-typing rules we had for normal class names haven’t changed at all.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:03,679 –&gt; 00:11:05,679<br>And that covers all four cases.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:05,679 –&gt; 00:11:10,679<br>We could have self-type on both sides, we could have self-type just on the left side or just on the right side.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:10,679 –&gt; 00:11:14,679<br>And finally, we could have a sub-typing relationship with no self-type at all.</p>
