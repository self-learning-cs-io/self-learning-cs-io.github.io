                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,120<br>This video is a continuation of the previous video where we’ll be finishing up code generation</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,120 –&gt; 00:00:15,679<br>for the simple language, dealing with function calls, function definitions, and variable references.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,679 –&gt; 00:00:23,199<br>So just to remind you what we’re working on, here’s the simple language, and again we have</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:23,199 –&gt; 00:00:28,760<br>a bunch of different kinds of expressions, and we dealt with all of these last time, except</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:28,760 –&gt; 00:00:33,560<br>for variable references and function calls. And of course we also have function definitions.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:33,560 –&gt; 00:00:37,800<br>So as I said in the introduction, these are the three constructs we’ll be looking at in</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,800 –&gt; 00:00:45,000<br>this video. The main issue in designing the code generation for function calls and function</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:45,000 –&gt; 00:00:50,600<br>definitions is that both of these will depend intimately on the layout of the activation record.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:50,600 –&gt; 00:00:54,680<br>So really, code generation for function calls, code generation for function definitions,</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:54,679 –&gt; 00:01:00,119<br>and the layout of the activation record all need to be designed together. Now for this particular</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:00,119 –&gt; 00:01:06,599<br>language, a very simple activation record will be sufficient. Because we’re using a stack machine,</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:06,599 –&gt; 00:01:11,560<br>we’re modeling a stack machine in our code generation, the result of a function call will always</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:11,560 –&gt; 00:01:16,439<br>be in the accumulator, and that means there’s no need to store the result of the function call</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:16,439 –&gt; 00:01:20,840<br>in the activation record. And furthermore, the activation record will hold the actual parameters.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:20,840 –&gt; 00:01:26,359<br>So when we go to compute a function call with arguments x1 through xn, we will push those</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:26,359 –&gt; 00:01:30,680<br>arguments onto the stack. And as it happens, these are the only variables in this language,</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:30,680 –&gt; 00:01:38,280<br>there are no local or global variables other than the arguments to a function call. And so those</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:38,280 –&gt; 00:01:42,120<br>are the only variables that will need to be stored in the activation record.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:44,600 –&gt; 00:01:48,680<br>Now recall that the stack machine discipline guarantees that the stack pointer is preserved</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:48,680 –&gt; 00:01:52,840<br>across function calls. So the stack pointer will be exactly the same when we exit from a function</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:52,840 –&gt; 00:01:57,720<br>call as it was when we entered the function call. And this means we won’t need a control link in</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:57,720 –&gt; 00:02:02,280<br>our activation record. The point of a control link is to help us find the previous activation.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:02,840 –&gt; 00:02:07,719<br>And since the stack pointer is preserved, we’ll have no trouble finding it when we return from a</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:07,719 –&gt; 00:02:12,360<br>function call. And we will never need to look at another activation during a function call since there</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:12,360 –&gt; 00:02:19,080<br>are no non-local variables in the language. We will, however, need the return address. And that</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:19,080 –&gt; 00:02:25,000<br>will need to be stored somewhere in the activation record. And one more thing, it turns out that a</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:25,000 –&gt; 00:02:29,960<br>pointer to the current activation will be useful. Now this is to the current activation, not to the</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:29,960 –&gt; 00:02:37,000<br>previous activation. And this pointer will live in the register fp, which stands for frame pointer.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:37,560 –&gt; 00:02:43,800<br>This is a, this is a, this is the register name on the MIPS and the name is chosen to denote the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:43,800 –&gt; 00:02:48,680<br>frame pointer and by convention, the compilers put the frame pointer there. What the frame pointer is</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:48,680 –&gt; 00:02:52,439<br>good for, well, it points to the current frame, so that’s what the name comes from, but what is good</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:52,439 –&gt; 00:03:00,199<br>for will see in a few minutes. All right, so to summarize, for this language, an activation record</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:00,199 –&gt; 00:03:05,479<br>that has the caller’s frame pointer, the actual parameters and the return address will be sufficient.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:05,479 –&gt; 00:03:11,639<br>So let’s consider the call to the function f and has two arguments x and y. Then at the time, the</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:11,639 –&gt; 00:03:17,319<br>call is performed before we start executing the body of the function. This is what the activation</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:17,319 –&gt; 00:03:21,799<br>record will look like. So we’ll have the old frame pointer. So this is the frame pointer that</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:21,799 –&gt; 00:03:27,879<br>points to the caller’s frame, not to the frame of the function that we’re executing. And the reason</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:27,879 –&gt; 00:03:31,879<br>that it does that is that we have to save it somewhere because the frame pointer register will be</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:31,879 –&gt; 00:03:36,280<br>overwritten with the frame pointer for the current activation. So we have to save the old one</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:36,840 –&gt; 00:03:42,759<br>so that we can restart the caller when we return to it from the current function. And then there</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:42,759 –&gt; 00:03:46,919<br>are the arguments of the function and notice that they’re pushed on the stack in reverse order. So the</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:46,919 –&gt; 00:03:52,280<br>last argument is pushed on first and the first argument is at the top of the stack. And the reason for</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:52,280 –&gt; 00:03:57,000<br>doing it this way is it’ll make the indexing to find the arguments a little bit easier, a little</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:57,000 –&gt; 00:04:03,080<br>bit simpler. And then we have the stack pointer. So there’s nothing here. And what we’ll go here</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:03,080 –&gt; 00:04:08,759<br>is at the call e, the function that we’re calling, will push on the return address. So this is where</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:08,759 –&gt; 00:04:15,319<br>the return address will go. And these elements, the caller’s frame pointer, the arguments to the</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:15,319 –&gt; 00:04:20,120<br>function and the return address of the called function, will make up the activation record of f.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:21,079 –&gt; 00:04:30,120<br>Now a bit of terminology, the calling sequence is the sequence of instructions of both the caller</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:30,120 –&gt; 00:04:35,639<br>and the call e to set up a function invocation. Okay, so that’s referred to in compiler lingo as the</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:35,639 –&gt; 00:04:41,639<br>calling sequence. And we’re going to need a new instruction to show the calling sequence for</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:41,639 –&gt; 00:04:47,480<br>this, for a function calls. And that will be the jump and link instruction. So jump and link</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:48,439 –&gt; 00:04:53,240<br>what it does is it jumps to the label that’s given as an argument. And it saves the address of the</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:53,240 –&gt; 00:04:59,240<br>next instruction after the jump and link in the register r a, which stands for return address.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:59,240 –&gt; 00:05:03,720<br>So what would happen in a jump and link instructions? If I have jump and link to label l,</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:04,280 –&gt; 00:05:08,680<br>and then they’re saying add instruction that comes next, I don’t know what it is, it’s the address</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:08,680 –&gt; 00:05:15,480<br>of this instruction, the one after the jump and link that will be stored in the in the register r a.</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:16,360 –&gt; 00:05:21,960<br>So this instruction will jump to l, it will store the address of this add instruction in r a,</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:21,960 –&gt; 00:05:27,560<br>and it will execute whatever code is at l. And then the code that’s at l can execute a jump back</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:27,560 –&gt; 00:05:35,879<br>to the address in here to execute the return to the caller. So now we’re ready to actually generate</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:35,879 –&gt; 00:05:43,160<br>code for a function call expression. So let’s say we have the call f of e1 to en, where of course e1</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:43,160 –&gt; 00:05:48,600<br>through e1 are expressions and let me change colors here. So these are expressions here not values.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:49,160 –&gt; 00:05:53,720<br>So how are we going to do that? Well, the first thing we’re going to do is we’re going to start</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:53,720 –&gt; 00:05:58,920<br>building the activation record. And so we save the current frame pointer. This is the frame pointer</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:58,920 –&gt; 00:06:04,440<br>for the caller. Okay, so this is pointing to the caller’s frame. Okay, and we store that at the stack</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:04,440 –&gt; 00:06:12,520<br>pointer. We have to bump the stack pointer. And then we generate code for the last argument for</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:12,519 –&gt; 00:06:19,399<br>en. And so that code gets inserted here. And then we push it on the stack. So we store the</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:19,399 –&gt; 00:06:25,240<br>result of en, which will be in the accumulator a zero on the stack. And then we bump the stack pointer.</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:26,599 –&gt; 00:06:31,799<br>Okay, and then we’ll do that for all the arguments finishing up with e1. So we generate code for e1.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:32,439 –&gt; 00:06:36,599<br>And we push it onto the stack. Okay, so now all the arguments are on the stack.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:37,560 –&gt; 00:06:43,000<br>Okay, and now we just do the jump in link. So we’ve done as much of the work and much of the</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:43,000 –&gt; 00:06:49,160<br>calling sequences we can do on the caller side. So this code is executing in the function in the caller.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:51,080 –&gt; 00:06:57,640<br>Okay, so this is the caller side of the calling sequence. And it builds up as much of the activation</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:57,640 –&gt; 00:07:02,439<br>record as it can. In particular, it’s evaluating the actual parameters and pushing them onto the</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:02,439 –&gt; 00:07:07,399<br>stack to form part of the activation record for the called function. And then we do the jump in</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:07,399 –&gt; 00:07:11,879<br>link and we jump to the entry point of the function that we’re calling. So we’re calling, this is a</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:11,879 –&gt; 00:07:20,519<br>call to f. And so we jump to f’s entry point. So a few more things to note. First of all, as we</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:20,519 –&gt; 00:07:25,399<br>discussed on the previous slide, when we execute the jump in link instruction, that is going to save</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:25,399 –&gt; 00:07:31,079<br>the return address in the register RA. And that address will be this address here. The one that comes</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:31,079 –&gt; 00:07:37,240<br>after the address of the next instruction after the jump in link instruction. And then notice also</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:37,240 –&gt; 00:07:43,719<br>that the activation record we’ve built so far is four times n plus four bytes. So this is where n</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:43,719 –&gt; 00:07:48,680<br>here is the number of arguments. Each argument takes up four bytes and then four bytes for the old</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:48,680 –&gt; 00:07:54,680<br>frame pointer. Now, we’re ready to talk about the call aside of the calling sequence. And we’re</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:54,680 –&gt; 00:07:59,560<br>going to need one new instruction for that. The JR instruction stands for jump register. And it</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:59,560 –&gt; 00:08:07,160<br>just jumps to the address in its register argument. So now the call aside is the code for the function</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:07,160 –&gt; 00:08:13,000<br>definition. Okay, so this is the code that actually executes the body of the function. And how do we</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:13,000 –&gt; 00:08:18,199<br>generate code for that? Well, let’s take a look. Now, actually, the very first thing that should be</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:18,199 –&gt; 00:08:25,480<br>here is that this first instruction of the call aside is the entry point. So we’re missing the label</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:25,800 –&gt; 00:08:32,120<br>here. So this would be labeled F entry. Okay, so this is the target of the jump in link instruction.</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:32,120 –&gt; 00:08:37,560<br>And then the very first thing we do is we set up the frame pointer. So we copy the current value</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:37,560 –&gt; 00:08:43,159<br>of the stack pointer into the frame pointer. That’s that points to the end of the frame for the</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:43,159 –&gt; 00:08:49,159<br>call E for the new function that’s being executed. We also save the return address at the current</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:49,159 –&gt; 00:08:53,720<br>position on the stacks. Remember, there was one more thing to do. One thing that was missing on</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:53,720 –&gt; 00:08:58,040<br>the caller side of the calling sequence, which is the return address. We don’t know the return</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:58,040 –&gt; 00:09:04,519<br>address until after the jump in link instruction executes. And so the call E is the one that has to</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:04,519 –&gt; 00:09:10,759<br>save that value. Okay, so after the jump in link, the R a register contains the return address,</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:10,759 –&gt; 00:09:16,840<br>and now we save it into the frame. And then we push the stack pointer. Okay,</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:18,440 –&gt; 00:09:22,680<br>and now we just generate code for the body of the function. So now that at this point,</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:22,679 –&gt; 00:09:27,479<br>the activation record is completely set up. And now we can just generate code for the function</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:27,479 –&gt; 00:09:31,799<br>body. And after the function body executes, of course, the stack pointer will be preserved.</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:32,839 –&gt; 00:09:40,439<br>And that means that the return address will be at four offset from the stack pointer. So we can</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:40,439 –&gt; 00:09:46,599<br>load the return address back into the return address register. All right, and then we can pop the</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:46,599 –&gt; 00:09:52,279<br>stack. So here we’re going to pop off the current frame from the stack. And that’s going to be some</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:52,279 –&gt; 00:09:58,679<br>size z, which we, I haven’t shown you what it is yet, but we’ll calculate the size of z in</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:58,679 –&gt; 00:10:02,279<br>just a minute. This is going to be an immediate value. So that’s a constant that we plug in there.</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:03,480 –&gt; 00:10:09,559<br>And then we load the old frame pointer. Okay, so once we’ve incremented the stack,</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:09,559 –&gt; 00:10:16,199<br>why we’ve popped off the existing frame. And so now we’re pointing at the frame pointer,</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:16,199 –&gt; 00:10:21,480<br>the first, we’re pointing at the first thing beyond the previous stack frame. And what was that?</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:21,480 –&gt; 00:10:26,039<br>Well, that was the first thing that we saved in the stack frame for f. And that’s the old frame</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:26,039 –&gt; 00:10:30,680<br>pointers. Now we restore the old frame pointer so that the call, that function that called us,</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:30,680 –&gt; 00:10:37,800<br>will have its frame pointer back. And then now we’re ready to return and resume execution of the</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:38,360 –&gt; 00:10:42,840<br>calling function. We just do that by a jump register to the return address.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:44,440 –&gt; 00:10:49,159<br>All right, so note here that the frame pointer points to the top of the frame, not the bottom of</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:49,159 –&gt; 00:10:52,759<br>the frame. Okay, so that will actually be important when we talk about how we use the frame pointer</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:52,759 –&gt; 00:11:00,439<br>when we get to talking about the variable references next. And the call E pops the return address</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:00,439 –&gt; 00:11:04,439<br>and the actual arguments and the saved value of the frame pointer from the stack. So the call E pops</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:04,439 –&gt; 00:11:10,839<br>off the entire activation record and also restores the caller’s frame pointer. And what’s the value</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:10,839 –&gt; 00:11:15,959<br>of z? Well, there are n arguments each of which take up four bytes. So there’s, so the size of</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:15,960 –&gt; 00:11:21,800<br>the activation record is four times n plus there are two other values in the activation record. One is</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:21,800 –&gt; 00:11:30,040<br>the return address. And the other one is the old frame pointer. Okay, in the space for two more</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:30,040 –&gt; 00:11:34,920<br>words is eight bytes. So that’s the size of the activation record. So that’s how much we have to</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:34,920 –&gt; 00:11:42,120<br>add to the stack pointer to pop the activation record for f off of the stack. Just to give you a sketch</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:42,519 –&gt; 00:11:48,200<br>of what this looks like before the call. We have the frame pointer for the caller and we have the</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:48,200 –&gt; 00:11:55,320<br>the current value of the stack pointer. And on entry to the function, okay, after the calling</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:55,320 –&gt; 00:12:01,080<br>after the calling functions side of the calling sequence has completed, what’s on the stack? Well,</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:01,080 –&gt; 00:12:05,720<br>we have the old frame pointer and the two arguments. And then the stack pointer points to the next</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:05,720 –&gt; 00:12:11,320<br>unused location, which is where the return address will go. All right, then we do the jump in link.</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:11,320 –&gt; 00:12:17,000<br>We jump over and the return address gets pushed onto the stack and the frame pointer gets moved</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:17,000 –&gt; 00:12:23,640<br>to point to the current value of the frame. Okay, you get to point to the top of the frame, okay. And then</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:23,640 –&gt; 00:12:27,640<br>after the call, what has happened? Well, we’ve popped everything off the stack. We’ve popped the entire</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:27,640 –&gt; 00:12:33,800<br>activation record for the call function off of the stack. And so now notice that we’re back in</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:33,800 –&gt; 00:12:39,880<br>the same state. So again, function calls have to preserve the invariant that the stack is preserved</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:39,879 –&gt; 00:12:45,159<br>across the call. So the stack should be exactly the same after the call as it was on entry to the call.</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:47,799 –&gt; 00:12:52,039<br>So we’re almost done with code generation for the simple language. The last construct we need to</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:52,039 –&gt; 00:12:58,360<br>talk about is how we generate code for variable references. Now, the variables of a function, again,</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:58,360 –&gt; 00:13:03,240<br>are just its arguments, just the parameters to the function. There are no other kinds of variables</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:03,240 –&gt; 00:13:07,320<br>in this simple language. And these variables are all in the activation record. So really, all we</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:07,320 –&gt; 00:13:12,600<br>have to be able to do is generate code to look up a variable and its appropriate place in the activation</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:12,600 –&gt; 00:13:20,440<br>record. But there is one problem. And that’s that the stack does grow and shrink with intermediate values.</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:20,440 –&gt; 00:13:26,600<br>So when you call a function and you begin executing its body, values will be popped and pushed onto the</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:26,600 –&gt; 00:13:33,240<br>stack. Besides the activation record. So think back to the code generation for plus and minus. And if</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:33,240 –&gt; 00:13:38,120<br>then else, intermediate values were being pushed and popped from the stack. And so what this means</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:38,120 –&gt; 00:13:42,759<br>is that these variables that are in the activation record are not at a fixed offset</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:43,560 –&gt; 00:13:49,799<br>from the stack pointer. So we can’t use the stack pointer very easily to decide or define those</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:49,799 –&gt; 00:13:57,639<br>variables. So the solution is to use the frame pointer. The frame pointer always points to the</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:57,639 –&gt; 00:14:02,680<br>return address in the activation record. And because it doesn’t move during the execution of the</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:02,679 –&gt; 00:14:07,559<br>function body, we can always find the variables at the same place relative to the frame pointer.</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:08,279 –&gt; 00:14:15,719<br>So how do we do that? Well, let’s consider the i th argument x sub i. And just the i th argument</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:15,719 –&gt; 00:14:23,079<br>to the to the function. So where is that going to be relative to the frame pointer? That will be at</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:23,079 –&gt; 00:14:29,879<br>offset z from the frame pointer. And z is just four times i. And this is actually the reason here</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:30,679 –&gt; 00:14:35,879<br>for generating, for pushing the arguments on the stack in in reverse order, starting with the last</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:35,879 –&gt; 00:14:39,879<br>argument to the function, because it just makes this index calculation simple. It wouldn’t be that</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:39,879 –&gt; 00:14:44,600<br>much more complicated. If we push the arguments in the other order, it just makes it a little easier</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:44,600 –&gt; 00:14:50,840<br>to see how the indexing works. And anyway, this index, this offset is being calculated at compile time.</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:50,840 –&gt; 00:14:55,399<br>So I was at this number, this four times i is something that the compiler knows. What we’re putting</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:55,399 –&gt; 00:15:00,439<br>into the code here is just a fixed offset. So we’re not actually doing that multiplication at runtime.</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:00,439 –&gt; 00:15:08,199<br>The z here is just a number that’s computed statically by the compiler. So anyway, we just load at offset z,</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:08,199 –&gt; 00:15:16,519<br>which is the four times i, where i is the index, the position of the variable in the list of parameters.</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:17,480 –&gt; 00:15:21,720<br>At that offset from the frame pointer, that’s where x i is stored in the activation record, and we</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:21,720 –&gt; 00:15:27,000<br>just load it into the accumulator. So that is the entire code generation for a variable reference.</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:30,200 –&gt; 00:15:35,720<br>Here’s a little example. So for the function, the hypothetical function that we’ve been looking at</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:35,720 –&gt; 00:15:41,960<br>with two parameters x and y, x is going to be at the frame pointer plus four, and y will be at the</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:41,960 –&gt; 00:15:51,960<br>frame pointer plus eight.</p>
