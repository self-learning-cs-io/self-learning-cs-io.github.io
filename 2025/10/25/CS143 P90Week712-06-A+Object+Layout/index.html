                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,679<br>In the last several videos, we’ve discussed code generation for a very simple programming</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,679 –&gt; 00:00:08,679<br>language.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,679 –&gt; 00:00:12,759<br>In this video, we’re going to take a look at code generation for a more advanced feature</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,759 –&gt; 00:00:14,560<br>objects.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:14,560 –&gt; 00:00:21,519<br>Fortunately, the standard code generation strategy for objects is really just an extension of</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:21,519 –&gt; 00:00:22,519<br>what we’ve already learned.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:22,519 –&gt; 00:00:25,519<br>So, everything that you learned before we’re going to be using, and then there’s going to</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:25,519 –&gt; 00:00:29,800<br>be some additional things that we do specifically for objects.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:29,800 –&gt; 00:00:34,840<br>And the important thing to know about objects is the slogan that you hear when people</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:34,840 –&gt; 00:00:38,359<br>talk about object-oriented programming is this one.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:38,359 –&gt; 00:00:45,079<br>So if B is a subclass of A, then an object of class B can be used wherever an object of</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:45,079 –&gt; 00:00:46,880<br>class A is expected.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:46,880 –&gt; 00:00:49,240<br>So there’s a substitute ability property.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:49,240 –&gt; 00:00:55,920<br>If I have a piece of code that can work on A’s, then it can also work on B’s and any other</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:55,920 –&gt; 00:00:57,920<br>subclass of A.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:57,920 –&gt; 00:01:03,960<br>Now what this means for the case of code generation is that the code that we generate</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:03,960 –&gt; 00:01:04,960<br>for class A.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:04,960 –&gt; 00:01:11,240<br>So the code that we produce for methods in class A has to work unmodified for an object</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:11,240 –&gt; 00:01:12,719<br>of class B.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:12,719 –&gt; 00:01:21,719<br>And to see this, keep in mind that when we compile class A, we may not even know all the subclasses</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:21,719 –&gt; 00:01:22,719<br>of A.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:22,719 –&gt; 00:01:24,920<br>So those may not even have been defined yet.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:24,920 –&gt; 00:01:32,840<br>So in the future, some programmer may come along to find a subclass of A and our compiled</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:32,840 –&gt; 00:01:39,159<br>version of A will have to work with that new subclass.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:39,159 –&gt; 00:01:44,120<br>So there are really only two questions that we have to answer to give a complete description</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:44,120 –&gt; 00:01:46,840<br>of how to generate code for objects.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:46,840 –&gt; 00:01:50,480<br>The first one is how our objects represented in memory.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:50,480 –&gt; 00:01:54,480<br>So we need to decide on a layout and representation for objects.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:54,480 –&gt; 00:01:57,160<br>And the second one is how is dynamic the spatch implemented.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:57,160 –&gt; 00:02:01,800<br>So that’s the characteristic feature of using objects as we can dispatch to a method in</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:01,800 –&gt; 00:02:08,000<br>the object and we need an implementation of that.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:08,000 –&gt; 00:02:13,840<br>So to be concrete, we’re going to use this little example throughout this video.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:13,840 –&gt; 00:02:17,360<br>And I’ll just take a moment here to point out some features of it.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:17,360 –&gt; 00:02:19,360<br>So we have three classes.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:19,360 –&gt; 00:02:28,200<br>And classes A, B and C. Notice that A is a base class and B and C both inherit from A.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:28,200 –&gt; 00:02:36,360<br>And all three classes define some attributes, some fields, and also some methods.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:36,360 –&gt; 00:02:42,000<br>Now a couple of important features here is that notice that because B inherits from A and</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:42,000 –&gt; 00:02:48,360<br>C inherits from A, they both inherit both of those classes inherit the attributes A and</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:48,360 –&gt; 00:02:50,680<br>D from class A.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:50,680 –&gt; 00:02:58,120<br>So these two attributes that are defined in class A are available in class B and in class</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:58,120 –&gt; 00:03:06,140<br>C. So even though there’s no mention of A and D in the definition, say, of class B, the</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:06,140 –&gt; 00:03:11,040<br>methods in class B can still refer to those attributes.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:11,040 –&gt; 00:03:17,800<br>They are part of the attributes of class B. They’re just copied over or inherited from A.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:17,800 –&gt; 00:03:21,939<br>Another feature of this example that I’d like to point out is that all of the methods</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:21,939 –&gt; 00:03:27,640<br>refer to the attribute A. So attribute A is referred to in this method and this one referred</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:27,640 –&gt; 00:03:32,280<br>to twice in this method and also in this method.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:32,280 –&gt; 00:03:38,560<br>And the significance of this is just what we discussed a couple of slides ago.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:38,560 –&gt; 00:03:45,520<br>For all of these methods to work, attribute A is going to have to live in some place</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:45,520 –&gt; 00:03:50,600<br>in some place where all of them can find it when they’re generated code runs.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:50,600 –&gt; 00:03:58,760<br>So in particular, let’s consider the method F. So the method F exists in all three classes.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:58,760 –&gt; 00:04:06,879<br>All three classes, when it runs, it will refer to the attribute A. And even though the objects</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:06,879 –&gt; 00:04:10,360<br>would be different, in one case, it might be running on an A object, in another case, on</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:10,360 –&gt; 00:04:14,520<br>a C object, it will need to be able to find the attribute A.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:14,520 –&gt; 00:04:21,800<br>And so therefore, the attribute A has to be in the same place in each object.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:21,800 –&gt; 00:04:25,439<br>And so how do we accomplish that? Well, the first principle is that objects are laid out</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:25,439 –&gt; 00:04:33,720<br>in continuous memory. So an object is just a block of memory with no gaps and all the</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:33,720 –&gt; 00:04:38,840<br>data for the object is stored in the words of that block of memory.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:38,840 –&gt; 00:04:42,720<br>And each attribute is stored at a fixed offset in the object.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:42,720 –&gt; 00:04:49,600<br>So for example, there may be a place in this object for attribute A. And in this case,</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:49,600 –&gt; 00:04:56,800<br>it’s in the middle of the object, in the fourth position. And no matter what kind of object</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:56,800 –&gt; 00:05:03,040<br>it is, whether it’s an A, B, or C object, in our example, attribute A will always live</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:03,040 –&gt; 00:05:08,640<br>at that position so that any piece of code that refers to A, any method that refers to</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:08,639 –&gt; 00:05:16,039<br>A can find the attribute. Now, the other thing that’s important to understand, and this</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:16,039 –&gt; 00:05:22,000<br>is slight digression from what we’re talking about, but it’s a key aspect of code generation</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:22,000 –&gt; 00:05:29,560<br>for objects, is that when a method is invoked, the object itself is the self-parameter.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:29,560 –&gt; 00:05:37,279<br>So the self-parameter is this entire object. So self, when a function is invoked, will</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:37,279 –&gt; 00:05:41,439<br>refer to the entire object. So you think of self as being a pointer to the entire object.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:41,439 –&gt; 00:05:49,919<br>And remember that self is like this variable or this name in Java. And then the fields will</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:49,919 –&gt; 00:05:54,319<br>refer to particular or the attributes of the object will refer to particular positions within</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:54,319 –&gt; 00:06:02,079<br>the object. So for example, the A attribute we decided lived there. So here is the particular</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:02,079 –&gt; 00:06:08,639<br>object layout used in cool. So the first three words of a cool object contain header information.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:08,639 –&gt; 00:06:15,439<br>And every cool object always has these three entries. The first position is a class tag.</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:15,439 –&gt; 00:06:21,120<br>It offs at 0, the next word, it offs at 4, is the size of the object, and then something called</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:21,120 –&gt; 00:06:30,159<br>the dispatch pointer, and then all of the attributes. Now the class tag is an integer, which</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:30,160 –&gt; 00:06:36,080<br>just identifies the class of the object. So the compiler will number all of the classes. So in</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:36,080 –&gt; 00:06:41,040<br>our example, we had three classes, A, B, and C, and the compiler, for example, might assign them</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:41,040 –&gt; 00:06:47,440<br>the numbers one, two, and three. And it doesn’t matter what these numbers are as long as they are</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:47,440 –&gt; 00:06:51,600<br>different from each other. So it doesn’t have to be number consecutively or anything like that.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:51,600 –&gt; 00:06:57,840<br>The important thing is that the class tag is a unique identifier for a class. Each class has its own</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:57,839 –&gt; 00:07:04,879<br>unique bit pattern that tells you what kind of class the object is. And the other fields here,</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:04,879 –&gt; 00:07:09,919<br>the object size is also an integer, which is just the size of the object in words. And the dispatch</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:09,919 –&gt; 00:07:16,639<br>pointer is a pointer to a table of methods. So the methods are stored off to the side, and the</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:16,639 –&gt; 00:07:22,159<br>dispatch pointer is a pointer to that table. And we’ll talk about this more later. And then all the</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:22,159 –&gt; 00:07:27,599<br>attributes are laid out in the subsequent slots in some order that’s determined by the compiler.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:27,600 –&gt; 00:07:33,040<br>So the compiler will fix and order for the attributes in the class, and then all the objects of</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:33,040 –&gt; 00:07:39,120<br>that class will have the attributes of that class in the same order. And again, all of this is laid out</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:39,120 –&gt; 00:07:48,160<br>in a continuous chunk of memory. Now we’re ready to talk about how inheritance works. So the basic</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:48,160 –&gt; 00:07:54,560<br>idea is that given a layout for a class A, a layout for a subclass B, so this is a subclass of A,</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:55,280 –&gt; 00:08:03,120<br>can be defined by extending the layout of A. So we don’t need to move any of the attributes of A,</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:03,759 –&gt; 00:08:10,639<br>we can just add more fields onto the end of A’s layout. And so that’s going to leave the layout</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:10,639 –&gt; 00:08:17,759<br>of A unchanged, which is a great property because this is how the position of an attribute in the</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:17,920 –&gt; 00:08:25,120<br>object will always be the same for all the subclasses. So essentially, we will never, once we decide where</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:25,120 –&gt; 00:08:30,639<br>an attribute lives in a class, it will never change for any of the subclasses of that object. So B</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:30,639 –&gt; 00:08:37,679<br>is just going to be an extension of the layout of A. So let’s take a look at our example here and</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:37,679 –&gt; 00:08:43,919<br>see how that works. Let me just write down here a little bit about these classes because we don’t</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:43,919 –&gt; 00:08:51,120<br>have the example on the screen. So we had class A and class A had two attributes A and D.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:51,120 –&gt; 00:08:55,679<br>And it doesn’t matter what their types are or what the methods were here. We’re just looking</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:55,679 –&gt; 00:09:00,799<br>at the class names and the names of the attributes that are defined in the class. And then we had B,</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:02,000 –&gt; 00:09:10,879<br>which inherits from A and B added an attribute little B. And then we had C, which also inherits</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:10,879 –&gt; 00:09:19,759<br>from A, but has no relationship to B. And class C defined an attribute little C.</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:22,559 –&gt; 00:09:28,720<br>All right, so that’s the structure of our example. This relevant to the layout of the objects.</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:29,840 –&gt; 00:09:36,080<br>Okay, so let’s talk about the layout of class A. So in position zero, it also zero, there’ll be a tag</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:36,080 –&gt; 00:09:42,080<br>for A. That’ll be some small integer that the compiler picks. They’ll be the size of A. We’ll come</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:42,080 –&gt; 00:09:46,800<br>back to that in just a second. There’ll be the dispatch pointer, okay, which we’re going to talk about</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:46,800 –&gt; 00:09:54,000<br>later. And then come the attributes of A. And they’re just laid out. The way it’s done in the</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:54,000 –&gt; 00:09:59,840<br>the cool C implementation is that they are laid out in the order in which they appear textually</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:59,840 –&gt; 00:10:05,520<br>in the class. So in this case, first the attribute A and then the attribute D at offstates 12 and</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:05,519 –&gt; 00:10:12,559<br>16. And now since the object, there were two attributes in three header words, that means that</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:12,559 –&gt; 00:10:20,559<br>the size of the object is five words. And so it’s a five that goes in the size field for A objects.</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:21,360 –&gt; 00:10:27,919<br>Now let’s take a look at B. Okay, so B is going to have a different tag. B objects will have a</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:27,919 –&gt; 00:10:32,879<br>different tag. So they, to distinguish them from A objects, there’s going to be an extra field.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:32,879 –&gt; 00:10:39,039<br>So the size will be one bigger. But now the layout preserves the layout of A. So the attributes of A</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:39,039 –&gt; 00:10:45,200<br>appear in the same position. And you can think of there being an A object actually embedded inside</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:45,200 –&gt; 00:10:54,000<br>of the B object. If I were to strip off the end here, if I were to just cover up this last bit</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:54,000 –&gt; 00:11:01,440<br>here of B, I would see that this object here has the same size and the same attributes as an A object.</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:01,440 –&gt; 00:11:08,080<br>And so any piece of code that could work on an A object will also make sense running on a B object.</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:08,080 –&gt; 00:11:12,480<br>Now, of course, the tag is different because it actually is a subclass. And you know,</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:12,480 –&gt; 00:11:16,560<br>and there is this extra fields of the size is different. But the point is that any code that refers</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:16,560 –&gt; 00:11:23,440<br>just to the fields here will still work just fine. So any A method that was compiled to refer to</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:23,440 –&gt; 00:11:29,040<br>the methods of an A object will still find those attributes in the same place in the B object.</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:29,039 –&gt; 00:11:35,839<br>Now, of course, there is also one more field here, which is the new attribute of B. And I just</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:35,839 –&gt; 00:11:41,599<br>get laid out after all of A’s fields. So after all of A’s fields come all of B’s fields in the same</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:41,599 –&gt; 00:11:47,519<br>order, which they appear textually in the class. Since there’s only one, there’s just one new field there.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:47,519 –&gt; 00:11:53,599<br>And now looking at class C, while the story with class C is very similar. So C has its own distinct tag.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:53,680 –&gt; 00:11:59,759<br>It also has one more attribute than A. So it has size 6. And now, again, the A attributes are in</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:59,759 –&gt; 00:12:05,519<br>the same positions. And now the C attribute just comes after the A attribute. And so notice here</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:05,519 –&gt; 00:12:11,680<br>that A methods, again, will work just fine on C objects because the attributes are in the same</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:11,680 –&gt; 00:12:18,080<br>places. And so the methods will find the attributes were they expect to. You can not, however,</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:18,080 –&gt; 00:12:27,200<br>call a method of class B on an object of class C, because they have different attributes in the</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:27,200 –&gt; 00:12:32,000<br>third position. These may have completely different types. It may not make sense to invoke a B method</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:32,000 –&gt; 00:12:36,960<br>on a C object. But that’s just fine. Because if we look at our inheritance hierarchy over here,</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:36,960 –&gt; 00:12:42,400<br>we see that B and C are actually unrelated. They are both subclasses of A, but they have no</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:42,400 –&gt; 00:12:47,680<br>relationship to each other. B is not a subclass of C and C is not a subclass of B. And so</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:47,679 –&gt; 00:12:53,919<br>anything beyond their shared ancestry with A can be completely different in the layout.</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:56,879 –&gt; 00:13:03,039<br>So more generally, if we have a chain of inheritance relationships, let’s say we have a base class</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:03,039 –&gt; 00:13:11,359<br>A1 and A2 inherits from A1 and A3 inherits from A2 and so on with some class A n inheriting</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:12,240 –&gt; 00:13:18,560<br>at the bottom of this chain after some long sequence of other intermediate subclasses,</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:18,560 –&gt; 00:13:24,639<br>what is the layout of all these classes going to look like? Well, there’s going to be a header,</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:24,639 –&gt; 00:13:30,720<br>okay, the three word header. And that will be followed by A1’s attributes and then followed by A2’s</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:30,720 –&gt; 00:13:38,000<br>attributes followed by A3’s attributes and so on all the way down to A n’s attributes down here.</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:38,480 –&gt; 00:13:46,879<br>Okay, and if you look, again, something we talked about before, each prefix of this header is</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:46,879 –&gt; 00:13:53,279<br>essentially a valid object, a valid one of these objects. If I look at the first set of attributes,</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:53,279 –&gt; 00:13:58,080<br>everything up to the end of the A1 attributes, that forms a valid layout for an A1 object. If I stop</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:58,080 –&gt; 00:14:03,279<br>at the A2 attributes, I have a valid layout for an A2 object going all the way from the header down to</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:04,240 –&gt; 00:14:12,000<br>including the A1 and A2 objects. And then A3 includes all of A1, A2, and A3’s attributes and so on,</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:12,000 –&gt; 00:14:23,919<br>okay, and so each prefix of this object of this A n object has the correct layout for some superclass</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:23,919 –&gt; 00:14:31,519<br>albeit.</p>
