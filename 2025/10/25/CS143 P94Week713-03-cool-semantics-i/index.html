                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,099<br>In the next couple of videos, we’re going to be looking at the details of the cool operational</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,099 –&gt; 00:00:12,120<br>semantics going over the semantics of each individual kind of expression. We’ll start</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:12,120 –&gt; 00:00:20,199<br>with easy ones and work our way up to the more complicated ones.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:20,199 –&gt; 00:00:26,280<br>So the easiest rules are the rules for the constants in cool. So the value true, the expression</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:26,280 –&gt; 00:00:31,080<br>true, I should say, evaluates to a Boolean with the value true. And it doesn’t modify</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:31,080 –&gt; 00:00:37,439<br>the store, so the store is unchanged because it doesn’t do any updates, obviously. And</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,439 –&gt; 00:00:46,040<br>there’s a corresponding rule for false. And integers are very, very similar. So if an integer</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:46,040 –&gt; 00:00:53,120<br>expression, integer literal i, will evaluate to an integer object with the value i. And</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:53,119 –&gt; 00:01:02,079<br>again, the store is not modified by such evaluation. And finally, strings, if a, if s is a</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:02,079 –&gt; 00:01:08,200<br>string literal of length n, then it will evaluate to a string object with the properties</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:08,200 –&gt; 00:01:17,560<br>n and the string constant s. The evaluation of identifiers is very straightforward given</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:17,560 –&gt; 00:01:22,200<br>that we have both an environment in a store. So to evaluate an identifier, and this would</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:22,200 –&gt; 00:01:30,320<br>be a variable name like x or y or foo. What do we do? Well, first we look up in the environment</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:30,320 –&gt; 00:01:37,680<br>where that identifier is stored. So now we’ll give us back a memory location, l, sub</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:37,680 –&gt; 00:01:42,879<br>ID in this case. And then we look up in the store, what the value is at that memory location.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:42,879 –&gt; 00:01:48,359<br>So we use the same memory location here as an argument to the store to get back the value</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:48,359 –&gt; 00:01:54,280<br>that that that variable currently has. And notice that just a reference is a read of memory.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:54,280 –&gt; 00:01:58,680<br>So this is loading. You can think of it as loading the value of the variable. This does not</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:58,680 –&gt; 00:02:02,560<br>affect the store. So the store is the same before and after. This is just looking up the</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:02,560 –&gt; 00:02:09,960<br>value of variable, not updating the variable. The expression self just evaluates to the</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:09,960 –&gt; 00:02:14,719<br>self object. So this is a place where we just make use of the fact that the self object</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:14,719 –&gt; 00:02:19,520<br>is part of the environment. So that just gets copied over here as the result of the expression.</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:19,520 –&gt; 00:02:28,159<br>And notice again that the store is unaffected by the evaluation of self. Now let’s see how</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:28,159 –&gt; 00:02:33,520<br>a slightly more complicated expression is evaluated in particular the assignment expression.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:33,520 –&gt; 00:02:39,680<br>So an assignment consists of two parts and identifier that is being updated and an expression</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:39,680 –&gt; 00:02:45,280<br>that is going to give us the new value. So for example, just to remind you we might have</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:45,280 –&gt; 00:02:51,760<br>something like x gets 1 plus 1. So 1 plus 1 here would be the expression e and x would be</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:51,760 –&gt; 00:02:58,159<br>the identifier. And so in order to evaluate the assignment, the first thing we have to do is we</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:58,159 –&gt; 00:03:03,920<br>have to know what value we’re going to be writing into the identifier. So what is the update we’re</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:03,919 –&gt; 00:03:10,639<br>going to perform? So the first thing to do is to evaluate e. And notice here that e is evaluated</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:10,639 –&gt; 00:03:17,119<br>in the same environment. So it has the same three components here as here. So it says the first</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:17,119 –&gt; 00:03:24,079<br>thing we do is we run e. And that’s going to give us back a new value v or this could back a value v,</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:24,079 –&gt; 00:03:29,599<br>excuse me. And possibly an updated store. So e can be an arbitrary piece of code. It could</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:29,599 –&gt; 00:03:33,919<br>itself have assignment statements in it. And so the store that we get out might be different.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:33,919 –&gt; 00:03:41,439<br>All right. So e produces a value v and an updated store s1. And now to actually do the assignment,</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:41,439 –&gt; 00:03:46,319<br>what do we do? Well, we have to know what memory location we’re supposed to update. So we look up</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:46,319 –&gt; 00:03:53,599<br>the memory location for id and I’ll give us some location l sub id. And then we modify the store</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:54,159 –&gt; 00:03:59,759<br>with the new value. We modify the store at that point with the new value. So we replace the</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:59,759 –&gt; 00:04:06,240<br>location lid or we update the value at the location lid to be the value of e, the value v. And we do</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:06,240 –&gt; 00:04:14,400<br>that in store s1, which gives us a new store s2. And now notice that s2 is the store that results</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:14,400 –&gt; 00:04:19,839<br>from the evaluation of e. Okay. So after we view the assignment, the assignment returns the value v,</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:19,839 –&gt; 00:04:25,679<br>which was of course the value of running e. And it returns the updated store s2.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:27,759 –&gt; 00:04:33,759<br>Next, let’s talk about the operational rule for addition. So to evaluate e1 plus e2, what are we</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:33,759 –&gt; 00:04:40,799<br>going to do? Well, first we’re going to evaluate e1. And notice that that is done in the same context</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:40,799 –&gt; 00:04:47,759<br>as the context of the entire expression. Okay. So the components of the context here for evaluating e1</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:47,759 –&gt; 00:04:55,039<br>are exactly the same as the components for the overall expression e1 plus e2. So when we evaluate</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:55,039 –&gt; 00:05:00,639<br>e1, it’s going to give us a value v1 and it’s also going to give us an updated store s1. And then</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:00,639 –&gt; 00:05:07,519<br>we’re going to evaluate e2. And notice here that the context is different. The self object and the</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:07,519 –&gt; 00:05:15,599<br>environment are the same. But now we’re running e2 in the new store s1. And what that’s a saying is</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:15,600 –&gt; 00:05:23,439<br>that if e2 has assignments or variable references in it, those assignments and variable references</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:23,439 –&gt; 00:05:29,520<br>have to be done on the store that resulted from running e1. Okay. So it’s very important that we get</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:30,080 –&gt; 00:05:37,120<br>any side effects that happen in running e1 are visible or that are seen by the expression e2.</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:37,120 –&gt; 00:05:42,640<br>So we run e2 in this environment. We’re going to get out the value v2 and update store s2.</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:42,639 –&gt; 00:05:48,479<br>And then the result of the entire expression is going to be v1 plus v2 and the resulting store will</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:48,479 –&gt; 00:05:56,079<br>be the store s2. And notice here how the stores tell you the order in which you have to evaluate the</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:56,079 –&gt; 00:06:03,519<br>expressions. So because e1 is evaluated in the same store as the overall expression, that tells you</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:03,519 –&gt; 00:06:11,360<br>that e1 has to be evaluated first. And then because e2 is evaluated in the store that’s produced by</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:11,360 –&gt; 00:06:20,240<br>e1, that tells you that e1, e2, excuse me, has to be evaluated after, evaluated e1. And then the</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:20,240 –&gt; 00:06:26,319<br>fact that s2 is the result of the whole thing tells you that e2 is also the last thing that you</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:26,319 –&gt; 00:06:34,800<br>evaluate during the execution of this particular expression. Okay. Let’s take a look at a statement</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:34,800 –&gt; 00:06:42,480<br>block and just for variety here, let me change my colors. So how are we going to evaluate a statement</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:42,480 –&gt; 00:06:48,000<br>block of statements e1 through EN? Okay. Well, so the semantics of this is that we should run them</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:48,000 –&gt; 00:06:54,560<br>in order beginning with e1. And the result of the entire execution will be the, sorry, the value of</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:54,560 –&gt; 00:07:01,040<br>the entire block, be the value of the last expression. And this rule just says that. So first we</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:01,040 –&gt; 00:07:05,760<br>evaluate e1 and notice that it’s done in the same store as the overall expression. So that’s what</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:05,760 –&gt; 00:07:12,960<br>tells you it has to come first. And that produces a new store s1 and a value v1. Okay. And then e2 is</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:12,960 –&gt; 00:07:19,920<br>evaluated in the store s1 and it produces a store s2 and so on. And then expression EN is evaluated</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:19,920 –&gt; 00:07:28,400<br>in the store sn minus 1 and it produces a value vn and a updated store s subn. Okay. And then the</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:28,399 –&gt; 00:07:37,039<br>result of the whole thing is the value of vn and also the updated store s subn. And this tells you,</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:37,039 –&gt; 00:07:42,319<br>this rule tells you the order in which you have to evaluate the sub expressions. The dependencies</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:42,319 –&gt; 00:07:47,439<br>here on the store force you to evaluate e1 and then e2 and then e3 and so on. So I have to do them in</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:47,439 –&gt; 00:07:52,560<br>that order to get the side effects, to get the side effects in the correct order for all of these</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:52,560 –&gt; 00:07:57,199<br>expressions. And furthermore, it also tells you the only value that you’re going to keep is the value</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:57,360 –&gt; 00:08:02,719<br>vn. Notice that none of the other values that are produced here are used for anything. They don’t appear</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:02,719 –&gt; 00:08:10,159<br>anywhere else in the rules. Let’s take what we’ve learned so far and do a small example.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:11,039 –&gt; 00:08:15,039<br>So we want to know what happens when we evaluate the block.</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:16,240 –&gt; 00:08:22,000<br>X gets assigned 7 plus 5. That’s the first statement and the second and last statement in the</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:22,000 –&gt; 00:08:27,839<br>block is just the expression 4. And the first thing we have to do is to say what the context is</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:27,839 –&gt; 00:08:32,240<br>in which we’re going to evaluate this. And the context consists of three parts. There’ll be a</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:32,240 –&gt; 00:08:37,679<br>self object. And in this case, it doesn’t really matter what’s in the self object because self is</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:37,679 –&gt; 00:08:43,120<br>not referred to in the program. And so it won’t plan your role in the evaluation. But we still need</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:43,120 –&gt; 00:08:49,840<br>it. There’ll be some self object out there. It just won’t get used. And now we need an environment</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:49,840 –&gt; 00:08:55,440<br>which tells us the locations for all the free variables in the program. So we just need a place</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:55,440 –&gt; 00:09:01,759<br>where X is going to be stored. And so X will be stored at some location L. And then we need to know</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:01,759 –&gt; 00:09:08,320<br>what our memory contents is, what our store is. And let’s just say that at L, we have initially the</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:08,320 –&gt; 00:09:15,680<br>value zero. Okay. So now we can use our rules to run this program or to evaluate this program. I’m</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:15,679 –&gt; 00:09:23,759<br>going to make this line here much longer. And recall that the evaluation of a block consists of</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:23,759 –&gt; 00:09:30,319<br>the evaluation of all the statements within the block. Okay. So the first one is going to be</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:31,359 –&gt; 00:09:37,679<br>X gets 7 plus 5. And that will be evaluated in the same environment as the overall expression.</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:37,679 –&gt; 00:09:45,599<br>So I will have up here are sorry the same context. Excuse me. And I should say I often slip. I</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:45,599 –&gt; 00:09:50,879<br>know I realize and say environment for the entire left hand side of one of these judgments.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:51,839 –&gt; 00:10:00,239<br>I’ve tried to be consistent and just use environment for the for the second component of the</p>
<p>93<br>00:10:00,239 –&gt; 00:10:04,879<br>context. Often in the literature people call the entire thing on the left hand side the environment.</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:04,879 –&gt; 00:10:10,080<br>And that’s why I make this mistake. But you know for this side of notes I’m trying to be consistent.</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:10,080 –&gt; 00:10:14,480<br>The entire all the components on the left hand side together are called the context. And the</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:14,480 –&gt; 00:10:19,200<br>environment is just the second component, the mapping from variables to their locations.</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:19,200 –&gt; 00:10:28,799<br>Anyway, coming back to the example. The first statement in the block is X gets 7 plus 5.</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:29,039 –&gt; 00:10:34,639<br>All right. And then we’re going to have the second statement as well. And we know that the</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:35,599 –&gt; 00:10:41,120<br>self object and the environment won’t change. But we don’t know what the store will be. Okay.</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:41,120 –&gt; 00:10:47,199<br>The store might be different. So we’ll leave the store empty for now. We’ll figure that out later.</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:47,199 –&gt; 00:10:54,479<br>And we’re going to be evaluating the expression for. Okay. So this is the structure of the evaluation.</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:55,279 –&gt; 00:11:00,080<br>Now to make progress we should look at at this first statement. Try to make some</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:01,360 –&gt; 00:11:05,440<br>forward progress on that one. So I evaluate the assignment. What do we have to do?</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:06,639 –&gt; 00:11:12,080<br>Well, the very first thing we have to do is we have to evaluate the right hand side. So we’re going to have</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:14,320 –&gt; 00:11:18,879<br>the context for that is going to be the same as the context we’ve been looking at</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:19,679 –&gt; 00:11:24,240<br>all along. Because it’s the first thing that’s actually going to happen is to evaluate</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:26,559 –&gt; 00:11:32,879<br>7 plus 5. Okay. And now I’ll leave me a little space down here for the rest of the assignment</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:32,879 –&gt; 00:11:37,279<br>rule which we’re not going to fill in just yet. Now to evaluate the plus expression,</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:37,279 –&gt; 00:11:44,240<br>we have to evaluate the first expression and the second expression. Okay. And so how do we do that?</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:44,240 –&gt; 00:11:49,600<br>Well, we know finally, I think how to do that because we’re finally down. We’re going to have a single</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:49,600 –&gt; 00:12:02,159<br>integer there and that we already have a rule for. Okay. So an integer literal evaluates to an integer</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:02,159 –&gt; 00:12:12,719<br>object. Okay. And inside that object is just the value. Okay. And the store is unmodified.</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:14,879 –&gt; 00:12:24,319<br>All right. And then similarly for the other argument here. Okay.</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:24,320 –&gt; 00:12:36,480<br>So the 5 will also evaluate to an integer object with a value 5 and the store will be unmodified.</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:36,480 –&gt; 00:12:45,440<br>Okay. So that’s the two sub expressions of this addition. And so now we can fill in the results</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:45,440 –&gt; 00:12:50,000<br>here. So we’ll take the contents of the two integers, we’ll add them. That will also be an integer</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:50,000 –&gt; 00:12:59,279<br>object. So we’ll get out the integer object 12 and the store has not been changed. Okay. So the</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:59,279 –&gt; 00:13:04,320<br>store that we get out here happens to be the same as a store that went in just because this expression</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:04,320 –&gt; 00:13:11,120<br>had no assignments at it. All right. And now we’re ready to do the assignment. Okay. So how do we do</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:11,120 –&gt; 00:13:16,720<br>that? Well, we have to form a new store. All right. So we’re going to have a new store which will</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:16,720 –&gt; 00:13:28,960<br>be L gets zero with the value at L. I don’t remember which way my notation went here. I think</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:28,960 –&gt; 00:13:35,920<br>if the thing the number comes first, we’re going to put 12 in the location L. And of course that store</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:35,920 –&gt; 00:13:44,800<br>is just equal to the store where L has the value 12. Okay. And so now what happens down here as we</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:44,799 –&gt; 00:13:52,719<br>do the assignment and we get out the new value. Okay. So the value of the right hand side is 12</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:53,519 –&gt; 00:13:59,839<br>and we have the new store where the location L has 12. All right. So now we’re ready to evaluate the</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:59,839 –&gt; 00:14:06,799<br>second statement in the block and that will be done in the store where L has the location 12.</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:07,359 –&gt; 00:14:13,599<br>And of course this is just a integer. And so that will evaluate to the integer constant</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:14,560 –&gt; 00:14:20,560<br>for the integer value excuse me for or integer object containing the integer object with the value for</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:21,200 –&gt; 00:14:30,480<br>and our store is just going to fit not quite. All right. And that’s then the result of the entire</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:30,480 –&gt; 00:14:36,879<br>evaluation. So this block will produce the value for an integer object with the value for an</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:36,879 –&gt; 00:14:45,679<br>updated store where location L has the value 12. So the next expression I would like to take a look</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:45,679 –&gt; 00:14:53,200<br>at is the if then else expression and to evaluate and if then else what do we do. Actually this should</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:53,200 –&gt; 00:15:01,120<br>be an if then else C of course. So to evaluate and if then else well we first we have to evaluate the</p>
<p>134<br>00:15:01,120 –&gt; 00:15:06,000<br>the predicate and that’s done in the same store the same context as the overall expression.</p>
<p>135<br>00:15:06,000 –&gt; 00:15:12,639<br>And if the result is true if the if the Boolean predicate returns a value true then we want to</p>
<p>136<br>00:15:12,639 –&gt; 00:15:17,279<br>evaluate just the true branch and not the false branch. So that’s why you only see here</p>
<p>137<br>00:15:18,159 –&gt; 00:15:22,799<br>evaluation of E2 and E3 isn’t mentioned anywhere. And just know here that the predicate may have</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:22,799 –&gt; 00:15:30,000<br>side effects and so E2 is evaluated in whatever store E1 produces. And then the result of the entire</p>
<p>139<br>00:15:30,000 –&gt; 00:15:36,000<br>expression is the value of E2. Okay. And that’s V and also the final store that’s produced by running</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:36,559 –&gt; 00:15:44,240<br>the then branch. And there’s a symmetric rule for what happens if the predicate evaluates to false</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:44,240 –&gt; 00:15:52,080<br>in that case you would evaluate E3 and not E2. Next we’ll take a look at what happens with while loops</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:52,080 –&gt; 00:15:58,559<br>in cool. So there are two cases. First if the predicate of the while loop evaluates to false</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:59,519 –&gt; 00:16:04,319<br>okay well in this case the loop body is not going to execute. All right so the first thing we do is</p>
<p>144<br>00:16:04,319 –&gt; 00:16:10,799<br>we evaluate the predicate and that’s done in the same context as the evaluation of the overall</p>
<p>145<br>00:16:10,799 –&gt; 00:16:14,959<br>expression. And if the predicate is false then we exit the loop and so the result of the loop</p>
<p>146<br>00:16:14,959 –&gt; 00:16:20,559<br>is void the value void and just whatever store results it from evaluating the predicate.</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:23,199 –&gt; 00:16:28,079<br>The other possibility is that the predicate evaluates to true. So here we evaluate the predicate</p>
<p>148<br>00:16:28,080 –&gt; 00:16:34,720<br>again in the same context as the overall loop. And if the predicate evaluates to true then we’re</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:34,720 –&gt; 00:16:39,920<br>going to run the loop body once. Okay. And so evaluate the loop body and notice that that’s done</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:40,720 –&gt; 00:16:43,600<br>in this in whatever store results from evaluating the predicate.</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:44,480 –&gt; 00:16:49,840<br>Evaluating the loop body is going to give us a value V and a new store S2 and then what we need</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:49,840 –&gt; 00:16:55,360<br>to do is we need to go back around and execute the loop again. And how can we do that? Well we’re</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:55,360 –&gt; 00:17:02,879<br>really just running the whole loop in the new context. So the next thing we do is we evaluate the</p>
<p>154<br>00:17:02,879 –&gt; 00:17:11,200<br>entire loop right in the new store. So after we execute the loop body one time then we go around</p>
<p>155<br>00:17:11,200 –&gt; 00:17:17,599<br>and just evaluate the loop again. And now this may run for zero or more iterations. All right and</p>
<p>156<br>00:17:17,599 –&gt; 00:17:24,240<br>when it finally terminates if it terminates it will produce a new store S3</p>
<p>157<br>00:17:24,880 –&gt; 00:17:29,120<br>evaluate a while loop of course always produces the value void and then what will produce</p>
<p>158<br>00:17:29,759 –&gt; 00:17:34,720<br>for the entire loop for the entire expression is the value void and the updated store S3.</p>
<p>159<br>00:17:37,680 –&gt; 00:17:43,359<br>The next interesting expression to take a look at is the let expression. So recall what this</p>
<p>160<br>00:17:43,359 –&gt; 00:17:50,400<br>looks like. So let in cool has a variable that’s being declared and it’s type an initializer which</p>
<p>161<br>00:17:50,400 –&gt; 00:17:56,080<br>is optional. So this is the value that the identifier will be initialized to and then the expression</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:56,080 –&gt; 00:18:00,880<br>in which that new variable is available. So how do we evaluate this? Well first we’re going to</p>
<p>163<br>00:18:00,880 –&gt; 00:18:07,200<br>evaluate the initial value of the of the of the new variable. So we evaluate E1 and as usual that’s</p>
<p>164<br>00:18:07,200 –&gt; 00:18:14,400<br>done in the initial store and it produces a possibly modified store. And now the question is what</p>
<p>165<br>00:18:14,400 –&gt; 00:18:20,240<br>are we going to what’s going to be the context here for the evaluation of E2 for the body of the</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:20,240 –&gt; 00:18:25,920<br>let. And so it seems clear that it’s going to involve S1 because it has all the updates for E1</p>
<p>167<br>00:18:25,920 –&gt; 00:18:30,240<br>but it also has to have this new identifier in it. And so how are we going to do that?</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:32,960 –&gt; 00:18:39,920<br>So what we want is to have a new environment E but with a new binding of ID to a fresh location.</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:39,920 –&gt; 00:18:44,720<br>So we’re introducing a new variable. Remember that the environment has a track all the free</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:44,720 –&gt; 00:18:49,920<br>variables. So this is one situation in which you’re going to extend the environment E with a new</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:49,920 –&gt; 00:18:54,880<br>binding. And that location, the location for new variable has to be a fresh location. We don’t want</p>
<p>172<br>00:18:54,880 –&gt; 00:19:00,880<br>to conflict with any other memory location we’re already using. And so we’re going to allocate a new</p>
<p>173<br>00:19:00,880 –&gt; 00:19:08,720<br>memory location for the variable. And then the store, the new store, will also will be like S1 as we</p>
<p>174<br>00:19:08,720 –&gt; 00:19:12,960<br>said it has to include all the values for S1 but it’s also going to have this new location</p>
<p>175<br>00:19:13,759 –&gt; 00:19:17,600<br>for the variable and that’s going to have the initial value of the variable V1.</p>
<p>176<br>00:19:20,400 –&gt; 00:19:25,279<br>To express that we need a new location, we’re going to introduce a new operation on a store which</p>
<p>177<br>00:19:25,279 –&gt; 00:19:32,240<br>gives us a new fresh location. So new look applied to a store is just going to give us some location</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:32,240 –&gt; 00:19:38,560<br>that isn’t being used by the store. So the store has a domain where it’s a mapping from</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:38,560 –&gt; 00:19:45,360<br>locations to values and we’ll just pick some new location that isn’t in the current list of</p>
<p>180<br>00:19:45,359 –&gt; 00:19:50,559<br>locations within the store and that will be the one returned or that will be one that will be</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:50,559 –&gt; 00:19:55,679<br>the one returned by new look. Okay, so new look you can think of as modeling the memory allocation</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:55,679 –&gt; 00:20:03,279<br>function in the runtime system. So then here we can write out the rule. So this is the most</p>
<p>183<br>00:20:03,279 –&gt; 00:20:09,199<br>complicated rule we’ve seen so far. So I’ll just take a moment to walk through it. All right, so</p>
<p>184<br>00:20:09,200 –&gt; 00:20:15,920<br>the first thing we do is we evaluate E1, the initializer for the new variable. Okay, so just like</p>
<p>185<br>00:20:15,920 –&gt; 00:20:20,480<br>before this is done in the same context as the overall expression and this is going to give us a</p>
<p>186<br>00:20:20,480 –&gt; 00:20:25,759<br>value of V1 and an updated store. All right, then in the updated store, using the update store here,</p>
<p>187<br>00:20:25,759 –&gt; 00:20:35,039<br>we find an unused location, L new. Okay, and then we’re going to create a store where that new location</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:36,000 –&gt; 00:20:41,599<br>has where it has the value of E1. So we’re going to store the value of E1 at that new location.</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:41,599 –&gt; 00:20:47,119<br>We’re going to update the store S1 to reflect that and furthermore, we’re going to extend our</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:47,119 –&gt; 00:20:53,359<br>environment with the new identifier which will be stored at this new location and this is the</p>
<p>191<br>00:20:53,359 –&gt; 00:20:59,119<br>context then. Okay, with this updated environment and store in which we evaluate the body of the</p>
<p>192<br>00:20:59,599 –&gt; 00:21:06,319<br>which will produce a value V2 and a possibly updated store S2 and those are the results of the</p>
<p>193<br>00:21:06,319 –&gt; 00:21:13,519<br>overall expression.</p>
