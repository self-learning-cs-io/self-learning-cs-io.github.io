                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,800<br>In this video, we’re going to continue and complete our discussion of cool operational semantics.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,800 –&gt; 00:00:13,439<br>We’ll be taking a look at the two most complex operations in Cool, the allocation of a new</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,439 –&gt; 00:00:16,600<br>object and dynamic dispatch.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:16,600 –&gt; 00:00:24,160<br>We’ll begin by giving an informal discussion of what happens when a new object is allocated</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:24,160 –&gt; 00:00:25,760<br>in Cool.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,760 –&gt; 00:00:30,000<br>So the first thing that has to happen is we have to allocate space for the object and</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:30,000 –&gt; 00:00:33,719<br>essentially that means having enough space for the object’s attributes.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:33,719 –&gt; 00:00:38,960<br>So we’re going to have to allocate a location for every attribute of the object of class</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:38,960 –&gt; 00:00:44,079<br>t if what we’re doing is allocating a new t object.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:44,079 –&gt; 00:00:49,320<br>Now we’re going to set the attributes of that object to their default values and in a</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:49,320 –&gt; 00:00:54,719<br>few minutes we’ll say what the default values are and why we need to set the attributes</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:54,719 –&gt; 00:00:56,519<br>to defaults.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:56,519 –&gt; 00:00:58,479<br>And then we evaluate the initializers.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:58,479 –&gt; 00:01:03,039<br>So every attribute in the class declaration can have an initializing expression.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:03,039 –&gt; 00:01:08,319<br>We’re going to evaluate those and set the resulting attribute values.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:08,319 –&gt; 00:01:10,400<br>And then we return the newly allocated objects.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:10,400 –&gt; 00:01:14,879<br>So these are the steps that are involved in setting up a new object.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:14,879 –&gt; 00:01:18,280<br>And as you can see, it’s actually more than just allocating a little bit of memory.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:18,280 –&gt; 00:01:27,120<br>It’s actually quite a bit of computation going on in allocating new objects in Cool.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:27,120 –&gt; 00:01:30,879<br>Every class has a default value associated with that class.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:30,879 –&gt; 00:01:34,359<br>So for integers, the default value is zero.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:34,359 –&gt; 00:01:38,000<br>For Booleans, the default value is Boolean false.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:38,000 –&gt; 00:01:42,680<br>And for strings, the default value is the empty string.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:42,680 –&gt; 00:01:47,000<br>And then for any other class that isn’t one of these three basic classes for any other</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:47,000 –&gt; 00:01:51,840<br>class, the default value is void.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:51,840 –&gt; 00:01:57,000<br>In the operational rules, we’re going to need a way to refer to the attributes of a class.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:57,000 –&gt; 00:02:04,159<br>So we’re going to define a function called class that takes a class name and returns the list</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:04,159 –&gt; 00:02:06,719<br>of attributes of that class.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:06,719 –&gt; 00:02:10,639<br>So here we have all the attributes of class A. Let’s say they’re A1 through An.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:10,639 –&gt; 00:02:15,120<br>And in addition, this function is also going to tell us for each attribute to declare type</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:15,120 –&gt; 00:02:21,640<br>of the attribute and the expression that initializes the attribute.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:21,640 –&gt; 00:02:28,400<br>And one other important feature of this list is that it includes all the attributes of</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:28,400 –&gt; 00:02:31,960<br>class A, including the inherited ones.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:31,960 –&gt; 00:02:36,280<br>And there’s another detail, which is in what order these attributes appear.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:36,280 –&gt; 00:02:41,680<br>And this will actually become important when we define the semantics of how attributes</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:41,680 –&gt; 00:02:43,640<br>are initialized.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:43,639 –&gt; 00:02:51,479<br>And the rule is that attributes are listed in greatest ancestor first order.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:51,479 –&gt; 00:02:55,799<br>Okay, what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:55,799 –&gt; 00:03:07,739<br>Let’s say that we have three classes, A, B, and C. And A, sorry, B inherits from A and</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:07,740 –&gt; 00:03:13,140<br>C inherits from B.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:13,140 –&gt; 00:03:23,020<br>Okay, let’s say that A defines two attributes, A1 and A2, and B defines two attributes, B1,</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:23,020 –&gt; 00:03:29,180<br>B2, and C defines two attributes, C1 and C2.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:29,180 –&gt; 00:03:36,939<br>Then class of C will list the attributes in the following order.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:36,939 –&gt; 00:03:44,259<br>First we’ll come A1 and then A2, because A is the greatest ancestor.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:44,259 –&gt; 00:03:48,819<br>It’s the closest to the root of the object hierarchy.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:48,819 –&gt; 00:03:53,340<br>And the attributes within class A, or within any class, are always listed in the order in</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:53,340 –&gt; 00:03:54,620<br>which they textually appear.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:54,620 –&gt; 00:03:56,579<br>So first comes A1 and A2.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:56,579 –&gt; 00:04:01,659<br>And of course, the type in the initializer are also listed here for both of these attributes.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:01,659 –&gt; 00:04:07,419<br>So we’re just concentrating here on the order in which the information appears.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:07,419 –&gt; 00:04:13,939<br>So then next would come class B. So the attributes in class B would be next.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:13,939 –&gt; 00:04:18,860<br>And of course, there would be the type and initializer for those attributes.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:18,860 –&gt; 00:04:23,379<br>And then finally, the attributes of class C, again in the order in which they’re listed</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:23,379 –&gt; 00:04:24,860<br>in the class definition.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:24,860 –&gt; 00:04:29,060<br>Okay, so that defines the order of the attributes for any class.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:29,060 –&gt; 00:04:36,459<br>It’s always in the order from greatest ancestor, down the inheritance chain to the class itself</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:36,459 –&gt; 00:04:41,500<br>that is the argument of the class function.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:41,500 –&gt; 00:04:46,019<br>At this point, we’re ready to actually define the formal semantics of new T.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:46,019 –&gt; 00:04:48,060<br>Let me switch colors here.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:48,060 –&gt; 00:04:55,300<br>So we’re going to be allocating a new object of type T. And it’s going to be in a context</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:55,300 –&gt; 00:05:00,900<br>with self object as zero, environment E and store S.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:00,900 –&gt; 00:05:06,420<br>And the first thing we have to do is we have to figure out what kind of object it is that we’re actually going to allocate.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:06,420 –&gt; 00:05:11,420<br>And the only question is whether T is a self type or not.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:11,420 –&gt; 00:05:15,019<br>Because remember, self type is not the name of an actual class.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:15,019 –&gt; 00:05:20,740<br>If T is not self type, then the class that we’re going to allocate is actually a T.</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:20,740 –&gt; 00:05:22,019<br>T is actually a class name.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:22,019 –&gt; 00:05:25,019<br>And that’s the kind of object we’re going to allocate.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:25,019 –&gt; 00:05:32,139<br>If T is self type, then the kind of object we’re going to be allocating is whatever the class is of the self object.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:32,139 –&gt; 00:05:37,139<br>So we’re going to look at the dynamic type here of the self object, call that X.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:37,139 –&gt; 00:05:40,899<br>And that will be the class that we create.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:40,899 –&gt; 00:05:43,139<br>That will be the kind of object that we create.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:43,139 –&gt; 00:05:45,019<br>All right, so there’s two possibilities.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:45,019 –&gt; 00:05:48,539<br>Either object allocating an object of type T.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:48,540 –&gt; 00:05:56,580<br>If T is actually a class name, otherwise it’s an object of the same dynamic type as the self object.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:56,580 –&gt; 00:06:03,060<br>All right, so now we go and look up what kind of object T zero is.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:03,060 –&gt; 00:06:09,540<br>All right, and we get out the list of attributes types and initializers for T zero.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:09,540 –&gt; 00:06:15,780<br>So this tells us what we have to do to construct an object of this type.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:15,819 –&gt; 00:06:19,619<br>All right, the next thing we do is we allocate locations for each of the attributes.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:19,619 –&gt; 00:06:25,979<br>So because there were in attributes, we’re going to allocate in locations, one for each attribute.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:25,979 –&gt; 00:06:31,500<br>All right, and then we’re going to create an object with the class tag T zero.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:31,500 –&gt; 00:06:35,859<br>And the attributes are going to be bound to these new locations.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:35,859 –&gt; 00:06:41,500<br>So the is attribute will be a bound to the is new location that we just allocated.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:41,500 –&gt; 00:06:44,339<br>And then we’re going to update the store.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:44,339 –&gt; 00:06:46,459<br>Okay, it’s going to take our initial store.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:46,459 –&gt; 00:06:48,859<br>You know, so this is the same as the store that we started with.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:48,859 –&gt; 00:06:54,179<br>We’re going to take S and we’re going to update it so that at these new locations,</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:54,179 –&gt; 00:07:00,099<br>those locations hold the default values for the types of each of the attributes.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:00,099 –&gt; 00:07:03,299<br>Okay, and that gives us the store S one.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:03,299 –&gt; 00:07:09,859<br>And now we have to evaluate the initialize it to actually initialize the attributes.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:09,860 –&gt; 00:07:14,500<br>And we have to think about what the environment is in which those attributes are initialized.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:14,500 –&gt; 00:07:19,500<br>And remember, the rule is that within initializer of an attribute,</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:19,500 –&gt; 00:07:23,060<br>all the attributes of the class are in scope.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:23,060 –&gt; 00:07:29,699<br>All right, so the environment, in this case, for the initializers, will just consist of the initialize</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:29,699 –&gt; 00:07:32,340<br>or the attributes, excuse me themselves.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:32,340 –&gt; 00:07:34,580<br>Okay, so these are the attribute names.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:34,579 –&gt; 00:07:40,699<br>And the is attribute is bound to the is new memory location holding the value,</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:40,699 –&gt; 00:07:44,060<br>the default value initially of that attribute.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:44,060 –&gt; 00:07:48,979<br>All right, and then finally, to evaluate the initializers, we just evaluate them as a block</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:48,979 –&gt; 00:07:51,299<br>in the order in which they appeared in the class function.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:51,299 –&gt; 00:07:57,299<br>This is why it was important to specify the order in the class function.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:57,299 –&gt; 00:08:01,579<br>So remember that these attributes include all the inherited attributes.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:01,579 –&gt; 00:08:05,579<br>So we’ll start by evaluating initializing attributes of the greatest ancestor</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:05,579 –&gt; 00:08:10,899<br>and working our way down to the attributes declared within the class itself.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:10,899 –&gt; 00:08:14,779<br>Notice that the environment here, which has all the attributes in scope,</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:14,779 –&gt; 00:08:16,259<br>this is an interesting point.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:16,259 –&gt; 00:08:23,099<br>This environment has nothing to do with the environment in which new T is actually evaluated.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:23,099 –&gt; 00:08:27,180<br>Now these environments, E and E prime, are completely separate.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:27,180 –&gt; 00:08:31,539<br>Okay, so new, so E prime has in scope, the names of the attributes,</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:31,580 –&gt; 00:08:36,980<br>the class E is a, you know, is, is some other environment.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:36,980 –&gt; 00:08:40,700<br>There’s some function somewhere that’s calling new T and the variables that are in scope</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:40,700 –&gt; 00:08:42,740<br>there are just completely different.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:42,740 –&gt; 00:08:49,500<br>Okay, but anyway, evaluating this block of initializers will yield some value</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:49,500 –&gt; 00:08:51,500<br>and a new store.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:51,500 –&gt; 00:08:54,180<br>The value isn’t used for anything, okay?</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:54,180 –&gt; 00:08:57,259<br>But the new store is the final store.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:57,259 –&gt; 00:09:00,460<br>That’s the store that we get out as a result of allocating the object.</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:00,460 –&gt; 00:09:02,940<br>And then what is the result of new T?</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:02,940 –&gt; 00:09:05,940<br>Well, it is the new object itself, V.</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:05,940 –&gt; 00:09:10,620<br>To summarize the semantics of new,</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:10,620 –&gt; 00:09:13,980<br>notice that the first three steps allocate the object.</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:13,980 –&gt; 00:09:16,060<br>Those are things that actually allocate the memory for the object.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:16,060 –&gt; 00:09:21,700<br>And then the remaining steps initialize the object by evaluating a sequence of assignments.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:21,700 –&gt; 00:09:24,860<br>And the most important thing probably to understand about initialization</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:24,860 –&gt; 00:09:28,220<br>or one of the most important things is the context in which,</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:28,220 –&gt; 00:09:31,139<br>or the state in which the initializers are evaluated.</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:31,139 –&gt; 00:09:34,100<br>So, notice that only the attributes are in scope, we emphasize that.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:34,100 –&gt; 00:09:36,500<br>And that’s just, in the same rule as in typing.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:36,500 –&gt; 00:09:39,300<br>So, when you’re type checking a class declaration,</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:39,300 –&gt; 00:09:41,660<br>only the attributes are in scope of the, you know,</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:41,660 –&gt; 00:09:43,379<br>for the initializers of the class.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:43,379 –&gt; 00:09:46,420<br>And then that’s the same, naturally, the same thing that we use</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:46,420 –&gt; 00:09:49,420<br>when we actually evaluate the initializers at runtime.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:50,420 –&gt; 00:09:54,259<br>And the initial values of the attributes are the default values.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:54,259 –&gt; 00:09:58,060<br>And we need the defaults because, precisely because</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:58,059 –&gt; 00:10:01,139<br>the attributes are in scope inside their own initializers.</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:01,139 –&gt; 00:10:03,899<br>So, it could be, for example,</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:03,899 –&gt; 00:10:08,059<br>it’s perfectly reasonable and cool to have an initializer.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:08,059 –&gt; 00:10:09,779<br>Let’s say like this.</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:10,779 –&gt; 00:10:15,859<br>And I’m just going to, I may leave out all the types here just to save time.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:15,859 –&gt; 00:10:19,459<br>But I can assign an attribute A, the value of A.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:19,459 –&gt; 00:10:22,699<br>And this is perfectly okay because the right-hand side of the initializer</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:22,699 –&gt; 00:10:24,659<br>has all the attributes in scope.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:24,659 –&gt; 00:10:28,100<br>And for this to make sense, A has to have some kind of default value,</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:28,100 –&gt; 00:10:30,179<br>has to have some initial value.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:30,179 –&gt; 00:10:33,100<br>So, because I might read it before I,</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:33,100 –&gt; 00:10:38,899<br>I might read an attribute before I’ve actually finished computing its initializer.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:39,659 –&gt; 00:10:44,179<br>All right, and the last point here is that notice that in the initialization</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:44,179 –&gt; 00:10:48,219<br>or in the, in the initialization of an object,</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:48,219 –&gt; 00:10:53,179<br>self is, the object itself is the self object.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:53,179 –&gt; 00:10:54,379<br>And what do I mean by that?</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:54,379 –&gt; 00:10:57,019<br>I forgot to mention this on the previous slide.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:57,019 –&gt; 00:10:59,500<br>Just flipping back to that slide for a moment.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:59,500 –&gt; 00:11:05,139<br>Notice here that in the evaluation of the initializers,</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:05,139 –&gt; 00:11:09,100<br>what is the context, the self object is V.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:09,100 –&gt; 00:11:10,100<br>The self object is V.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:10,100 –&gt; 00:11:13,059<br>This is the new object that we have just constructed.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:13,059 –&gt; 00:11:16,419<br>And so it’s perfectly fine for E1 through EN,</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:16,419 –&gt; 00:11:20,100<br>the initialization expressions over here to refer to self.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:20,100 –&gt; 00:11:24,139<br>And what they will refer to if they use self is the object</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:24,139 –&gt; 00:11:25,620<br>that is being initialized.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:27,980 –&gt; 00:11:30,460<br>All right, returning to this to our summary,</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:31,539 –&gt; 00:11:34,819<br>you know, it might be a little bit of a surprise how complicated</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:35,740 –&gt; 00:11:40,259<br>the semantics of new is in cool.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:40,259 –&gt; 00:11:44,019<br>And it’s not just cool that has that property.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:44,019 –&gt; 00:11:49,620<br>In fact, every object-oriented language has a fairly complex semantics</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:49,620 –&gt; 00:11:51,379<br>for the initialization of new objects.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:51,379 –&gt; 00:11:55,019<br>And it’s a combination of features like inheritance</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:55,019 –&gt; 00:11:59,460<br>and the ability of initializers to refer to the attributes</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:59,460 –&gt; 00:12:01,820<br>that leads to this kind of complexity.</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:04,620 –&gt; 00:12:07,939<br>Now let’s talk about the semantics of dynamic dispatch.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:07,939 –&gt; 00:12:10,299<br>And we’ll follow the same plan that we did</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:10,299 –&gt; 00:12:11,939<br>with the semantics of new.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:11,939 –&gt; 00:12:14,460<br>First, I’ll give an informal discussion,</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:14,460 –&gt; 00:12:17,779<br>high-level description of how the evaluation</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:17,779 –&gt; 00:12:19,259<br>of a dynamic dispatch works.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:19,259 –&gt; 00:12:22,419<br>And then we’ll look at the formal operational rule.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:23,259 –&gt; 00:12:25,620<br>So the first thing that happens in evaluating the dispatches</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:25,620 –&gt; 00:12:28,939<br>that will evaluate the arguments E1 through EN.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:28,939 –&gt; 00:12:32,700<br>And next, we’ll evaluate the target object E0.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:32,700 –&gt; 00:12:34,860<br>So evaluate that expression to get the actual object</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:34,860 –&gt; 00:12:36,100<br>to which we’re dispatching.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:37,539 –&gt; 00:12:39,860<br>Next, we’re going to look at the dynamic type</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:39,860 –&gt; 00:12:40,860<br>of the target object.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:40,860 –&gt; 00:12:45,059<br>So after we evaluate E0, we’re going to look at what its class tag is.</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:45,980 –&gt; 00:12:48,740<br>And then we’re going to use that type</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:48,740 –&gt; 00:12:51,860<br>to figure out which function, which function F</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:51,860 –&gt; 00:12:52,820<br>we’re supposed to use.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:52,820 –&gt; 00:12:56,220<br>So we’re going to go and look in the method table</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:56,220 –&gt; 00:13:01,220<br>for the class X and see what method it has for F.</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:04,180 –&gt; 00:13:07,620<br>Now we’re going to create new locations and an environment</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:07,620 –&gt; 00:13:08,820<br>for the call.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:08,820 –&gt; 00:13:10,419<br>So we’re going to set up new locations</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:10,419 –&gt; 00:13:12,460<br>for the actual parameters.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:13,899 –&gt; 00:13:16,340<br>We’re going to initialize the locations</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:16,340 –&gt; 00:13:18,139<br>with the actual arguments.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:19,899 –&gt; 00:13:22,620<br>We’re going to set self to be the target object.</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:22,620 –&gt; 00:13:26,379<br>And then we’re going to evaluate the body of F.</p>
<p>198<br>00:13:29,340 –&gt; 00:13:32,620<br>Now in order to do the lookup of a method in a class,</p>
<p>199<br>00:13:32,620 –&gt; 00:13:34,340<br>we’re going to need some representation</p>
<p>200<br>00:13:34,340 –&gt; 00:13:36,620<br>of what methods exist in which classes</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:36,620 –&gt; 00:13:38,540<br>in our operational rules.</p>
<p>202<br>00:13:38,540 –&gt; 00:13:40,580<br>So we’re going to find a function impulse stands</p>
<p>203<br>00:13:40,580 –&gt; 00:13:42,139<br>for implementation.</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:42,139 –&gt; 00:13:47,139<br>And the implementation in a class A of a method F</p>
<p>205<br>00:13:47,139 –&gt; 00:13:52,059<br>is going to be, first of all, the list of formal parameters.</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:52,059 –&gt; 00:13:55,059<br>So it’s going to tell us what the formal parameters are of F.</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:55,059 –&gt; 00:13:58,860<br>And then the body of F, whatever the function body of F is.</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:01,740 –&gt; 00:14:04,259<br>Now we’re ready to actually discuss the details</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:04,259 –&gt; 00:14:08,700<br>of the formal operational semantics of method dispatch in cool.</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:08,700 –&gt; 00:14:11,299<br>And I’m going to switch colors here.</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:11,299 –&gt; 00:14:13,139<br>Again, just for contrast.</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:13,139 –&gt; 00:14:14,899<br>So as we said, the first thing we do</p>
<p>213<br>00:14:14,899 –&gt; 00:14:17,219<br>is we evaluate the end arguments.</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:17,219 –&gt; 00:14:20,299<br>So these first end lines take care of that.</p>
<p>215<br>00:14:20,299 –&gt; 00:14:23,740<br>And notice that each argument that’s evaluated may have side effects.</p>
<p>216<br>00:14:23,740 –&gt; 00:14:28,059<br>So it starts in some store, but it may produce a different store.</p>
<p>217<br>00:14:28,059 –&gt; 00:14:29,699<br>So after we’ve done all of this,</p>
<p>218<br>00:14:29,699 –&gt; 00:14:34,500<br>we have the end arguments evaluated and some store as sub-end.</p>
<p>219<br>00:14:35,500 –&gt; 00:14:38,859<br>The next thing that happens is we evaluate E0.</p>
<p>220<br>00:14:38,860 –&gt; 00:14:41,500<br>This is the expression to which we are dispatching.</p>
<p>221<br>00:14:41,500 –&gt; 00:14:44,820<br>And that will give us an object V0</p>
<p>222<br>00:14:44,820 –&gt; 00:14:47,860<br>and some updated store as sub-end plus one.</p>
<p>223<br>00:14:49,220 –&gt; 00:14:51,820<br>And now we have to inspect V0.</p>
<p>224<br>00:14:51,820 –&gt; 00:14:56,139<br>We want to know what’s inside of V0 or what V0 is made of.</p>
<p>225<br>00:14:56,139 –&gt; 00:15:00,659<br>And in particular, we’re interested in the class tag of V0.</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:00,659 –&gt; 00:15:04,740<br>And we’ll also be interested in the contents of its attributes,</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:04,740 –&gt; 00:15:07,220<br>the locations associated with its attributes.</p>
<p>228<br>00:15:07,220 –&gt; 00:15:10,980<br>So first let’s focus on the class tag.</p>
<p>229<br>00:15:10,980 –&gt; 00:15:12,420<br>Because we’re going to use that class.</p>
<p>230<br>00:15:12,420 –&gt; 00:15:14,779<br>Remember, this is the dynamic type of V0.</p>
<p>231<br>00:15:14,779 –&gt; 00:15:17,899<br>This is what kind of object V0 actually is</p>
<p>232<br>00:15:17,899 –&gt; 00:15:19,540<br>when the program is running.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:19,540 –&gt; 00:15:23,139<br>And we’re going to use that class to look up</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:23,139 –&gt; 00:15:24,860<br>the definition of F that we should run.</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:24,860 –&gt; 00:15:30,019<br>So we look for the method F in class X.</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:30,019 –&gt; 00:15:31,940<br>We want to know its implementation.</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:31,940 –&gt; 00:15:35,779<br>And in particular, we get the names of the formal parameters.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:35,779 –&gt; 00:15:37,459<br>X1 through Xn.</p>
<p>239<br>00:15:37,459 –&gt; 00:15:43,100<br>And we get the body of the function or method.</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:43,100 –&gt; 00:15:45,579<br>So the next thing we have to do is we</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:45,579 –&gt; 00:15:50,500<br>have to allocate space in the memory or in the store</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:50,500 –&gt; 00:15:53,419<br>for the actual parameters of the method call.</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:53,419 –&gt; 00:16:01,620<br>So we allocate N new locations, one for each actual argument.</p>
<p>244<br>00:16:01,620 –&gt; 00:16:05,459<br>And now we’re ready to build an environment in which we</p>
<p>245<br>00:16:05,460 –&gt; 00:16:08,340<br>can evaluate the method.</p>
<p>246<br>00:16:08,340 –&gt; 00:16:10,540<br>So what is this environment going to consist of?</p>
<p>247<br>00:16:10,540 –&gt; 00:16:14,180<br>So we have to think about what names are in scope inside</p>
<p>248<br>00:16:14,180 –&gt; 00:16:15,220<br>of a method.</p>
<p>249<br>00:16:15,220 –&gt; 00:16:18,740<br>Well, all the attributes of the class are in scope.</p>
<p>250<br>00:16:18,740 –&gt; 00:16:23,100<br>So this is a class X with attributes A1 through EM.</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:23,100 –&gt; 00:16:27,540<br>So the environment will have those names defined A1 through EM.</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:27,540 –&gt; 00:16:30,860<br>And now what are the actual locations of those attributes?</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:30,860 –&gt; 00:16:33,980<br>Well, those are the locations of V0.</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:33,980 –&gt; 00:16:35,620<br>That’s the object that we’re dispatching to.</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:35,620 –&gt; 00:16:37,740<br>That’s going to be the self object.</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:37,740 –&gt; 00:16:43,580<br>And the attribute names will refer to the attributes of self.</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:43,580 –&gt; 00:16:48,820<br>So the locations here are the locations of the attributes</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:48,820 –&gt; 00:16:51,060<br>in the object V0.</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:51,060 –&gt; 00:16:54,019<br>Now, in addition, the formal parameters</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:54,019 –&gt; 00:16:57,620<br>are also in scope inside of the method body.</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:57,620 –&gt; 00:17:02,500<br>So we add to this environment with just the attributes,</p>
<p>262<br>00:17:02,500 –&gt; 00:17:05,380<br>all of the formal parameters.</p>
<p>263<br>00:17:05,380 –&gt; 00:17:09,420<br>And they are at the new locations,</p>
<p>264<br>00:17:09,420 –&gt; 00:17:14,579<br>L sub X1 up to L sub Xn.</p>
<p>265<br>00:17:14,579 –&gt; 00:17:19,740<br>And notice the one slight subtlety about the way this is defined.</p>
<p>266<br>00:17:19,740 –&gt; 00:17:21,619<br>We’re taking an initial environment,</p>
<p>267<br>00:17:21,619 –&gt; 00:17:25,740<br>which I’ll show here, with the color of these braces in blue.</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:25,740 –&gt; 00:17:28,539<br>So we’re defining initial environments of the attributes.</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:28,539 –&gt; 00:17:31,539<br>And then we’re doing updates to that.</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:31,539 –&gt; 00:17:36,779<br>So we’re, instead of just defining X1 to map to L sub X1,</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:36,779 –&gt; 00:17:40,619<br>we’re saying we’re replacing the definition of X1</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:40,619 –&gt; 00:17:43,220<br>in this environment in the blue braces</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:43,220 –&gt; 00:17:45,379<br>with one that maps X1 to L of X1.</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:45,379 –&gt; 00:17:46,779<br>And why do we do it that way?</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:46,779 –&gt; 00:17:51,259<br>Well, the thing is that a method may have a formal parameter</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:51,259 –&gt; 00:17:54,099<br>that is the same as an attribute name.</p>
<p>277<br>00:17:54,099 –&gt; 00:17:59,019<br>So for example, I could have a class A that has an attribute</p>
<p>278<br>00:17:59,019 –&gt; 00:18:01,139<br>with a layer in it.</p>
<p>279<br>00:18:01,139 –&gt; 00:18:10,339<br>And it also has a method F that takes a formal parameter named A.</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:10,339 –&gt; 00:18:12,180<br>And if I do that, and of course I’m leaving out</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:12,180 –&gt; 00:18:14,220<br>types and lots of other things here,</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:14,220 –&gt; 00:18:16,619<br>so here I have an attribute named A that’s declared.</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:16,619 –&gt; 00:18:20,019<br>And then I have a method that takes an argument called A.</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:20,019 –&gt; 00:18:23,420<br>And now the question is, when I refer to A inside</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:23,420 –&gt; 00:18:26,299<br>of the body of the method, what A do I get?</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:26,299 –&gt; 00:18:30,460<br>Is this A bind to the formal parameter?</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:30,460 –&gt; 00:18:31,899<br>Is it bind to the attribute?</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:31,899 –&gt; 00:18:34,099<br>And the answer, we have to give one answer or the other.</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:34,099 –&gt; 00:18:38,539<br>The answer in cool is that it binds to the formal parameter.</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:38,539 –&gt; 00:18:42,619<br>That hides the outer name.</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:42,619 –&gt; 00:18:46,740<br>And that’s enforced here in the rule by these updates.</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:46,740 –&gt; 00:18:49,779<br>So if a formal parameter has the same name as one</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:49,779 –&gt; 00:18:53,339<br>of the attributes, it will replace the definition</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:53,339 –&gt; 00:18:56,139<br>of the attribute in the environment.</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:56,140 –&gt; 00:18:58,300<br>OK, once you have the environment set up,</p>
<p>296<br>00:18:58,300 –&gt; 00:19:00,980<br>we need to set up our store.</p>
<p>297<br>00:19:00,980 –&gt; 00:19:02,500<br>What are the changes to the store?</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:02,500 –&gt; 00:19:05,380<br>Well, we just have to store the actual value of each argument</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:05,380 –&gt; 00:19:09,140<br>at the location for that argument.</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:09,140 –&gt; 00:19:13,020<br>And finally, we’re ready to evaluate the function body.</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:13,020 –&gt; 00:19:16,180<br>And the interesting part here is the context in which that’s done.</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:16,180 –&gt; 00:19:23,660<br>So notice here that the self object in the context of running</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:23,660 –&gt; 00:19:28,100<br>the method F is the object to which we’re dispatching.</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:28,100 –&gt; 00:19:30,060<br>And then the environment is e prime.</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:30,060 –&gt; 00:19:31,500<br>In the new environment, we just set up.</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:31,500 –&gt; 00:19:34,019<br>And once again, notice that this is a complete change</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:34,019 –&gt; 00:19:36,740<br>of context that e prime, the environment e prime,</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:36,740 –&gt; 00:19:39,259<br>has nothing to do with the environment e.</p>
<p>309<br>00:19:39,259 –&gt; 00:19:42,980<br>e prime is built completely from scratch using only information</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:42,980 –&gt; 00:19:44,140<br>about the method we’re calling.</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:44,140 –&gt; 00:19:48,420<br>It doesn’t borrow anything from the environment</p>
<p>312<br>00:19:48,420 –&gt; 00:19:52,220<br>where the method originated, where the method was called from.</p>
<p>313<br>00:19:52,220 –&gt; 00:19:55,860<br>And finally, all of this is done in the store</p>
<p>314<br>00:19:55,860 –&gt; 00:19:58,900<br>that reflects all the side effects performed</p>
<p>315<br>00:19:58,900 –&gt; 00:20:01,940<br>by evaluating the arguments, by evaluating e0,</p>
<p>316<br>00:20:01,940 –&gt; 00:20:06,380<br>and by extending the store with locations</p>
<p>317<br>00:20:06,380 –&gt; 00:20:07,819<br>for the actual parameters.</p>
<p>318<br>00:20:07,819 –&gt; 00:20:10,860<br>So evaluate the body of the method.</p>
<p>319<br>00:20:10,860 –&gt; 00:20:13,860<br>We get back a value and another updated store.</p>
<p>320<br>00:20:13,860 –&gt; 00:20:16,819<br>And that value in store are the result</p>
<p>321<br>00:20:16,819 –&gt; 00:20:22,659<br>of the entire execution of the dynamic dispatch.</p>
