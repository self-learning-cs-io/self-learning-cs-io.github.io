                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,719<br>We’re now ready to begin our next major topic, program optimization.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,719 –&gt; 00:00:11,640<br>In this video, we’re just going to give an overview discussing why we want to perform</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,640 –&gt; 00:00:17,760<br>optimization and what the trade-offs are for compilers in deciding what kinds of optimizations</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,760 –&gt; 00:00:22,519<br>to implement.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,519 –&gt; 00:00:25,839<br>Optimization is the last compiler phase that we’re going to discuss.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,839 –&gt; 00:00:28,920<br>Let’s just very briefly review the compiler phases.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,920 –&gt; 00:00:34,440<br>First, there’s electrical analysis and then that’s followed by parsing.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:34,440 –&gt; 00:00:40,480<br>Then we have semantic analysis.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:40,480 –&gt; 00:00:47,040<br>And after that, we talked about code generation.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:47,040 –&gt; 00:00:49,760<br>And now we’re going to talk about optimization.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:49,760 –&gt; 00:00:54,040<br>So optimization actually comes before code generation because we want to improve the program</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:54,040 –&gt; 00:00:57,280<br>before we commit it to machine code.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:57,280 –&gt; 00:00:59,200<br>But it is, of course, the last one that we’ve discussed.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:59,200 –&gt; 00:01:03,980<br>But just to point out here, optimization fits in between generally semantic analysis and</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:03,980 –&gt; 00:01:05,379<br>code generation.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:05,379 –&gt; 00:01:09,120<br>And in modern compilers, this is where most of the action is.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:09,120 –&gt; 00:01:15,640<br>It usually has, by far, the most code and it’s also the most complex part of the compiler.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:15,640 –&gt; 00:01:20,960<br>Now, a very basic question is when we should perform optimizations and we actually have some</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:20,960 –&gt; 00:01:22,439<br>choices.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:22,439 –&gt; 00:01:25,560<br>We could perform them on the abstract syntax tree.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:25,560 –&gt; 00:01:29,240<br>And a big advantage of that is that it’s machine independent.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:29,240 –&gt; 00:01:34,600<br>But for many optimizations we want to do, it turns out that the abstract syntax tree</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:34,600 –&gt; 00:01:39,879<br>will be too high level that we can’t actually even express the optimizations we want to perform</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:39,879 –&gt; 00:01:45,960<br>because those optimizations depend on lower level details of the machine or of the kind</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:45,960 –&gt; 00:01:50,640<br>of machine that we’re generating code for that aren’t present in the abstract syntax tree.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:50,640 –&gt; 00:01:55,640<br>Another possibility would be to perform optimizations directly on assembly language.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:55,640 –&gt; 00:02:00,200<br>And the advantage here is that all the details of the machine are exposed.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:00,200 –&gt; 00:02:03,120<br>We can see everything that the machine is doing.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:03,120 –&gt; 00:02:05,719<br>We can talk about all of the resources of the machine.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:05,719 –&gt; 00:02:10,280<br>And so, in principle, any optimization we want to perform can be expressed at the assembly</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:10,280 –&gt; 00:02:11,280<br>language level.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:11,280 –&gt; 00:02:16,439<br>Now, a disadvantage of doing optimizations on assembly language is that they are machine</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:16,439 –&gt; 00:02:17,439<br>dependent.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:17,439 –&gt; 00:02:24,000<br>We have to potentially re-implement our optimizations for each new kind of architecture.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:24,000 –&gt; 00:02:30,879<br>And so, as we mentioned in the previous video, another option is to use an intermediate</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:30,879 –&gt; 00:02:31,879<br>language.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:31,879 –&gt; 00:02:36,400<br>And the intermediate language has the advantage potentially, if we’re designed well,</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:36,400 –&gt; 00:02:37,919<br>of still being machine independent.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:37,919 –&gt; 00:02:43,159<br>Meaning it can be a little bit above the level of the concrete details of very, very specific</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:43,159 –&gt; 00:02:44,159<br>architectures.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:44,159 –&gt; 00:02:48,879<br>Now, I mean, it can still represent a large family of machines.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:48,879 –&gt; 00:02:54,599<br>But while at the same time exposing enough optimization opportunities that the compiler can</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:54,599 –&gt; 00:03:00,840<br>do a good job of improving the program’s performance.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:00,840 –&gt; 00:03:07,680<br>So we will be looking at optimizations that work on intermediate language that has operations</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:07,680 –&gt; 00:03:09,560<br>given by this grammar.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:09,560 –&gt; 00:03:15,240<br>So in this case, a program is a sequence of statements and a statement consists of either</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:15,240 –&gt; 00:03:22,680<br>an assignment, which could be a simple copy or a unary or binary operation.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:22,680 –&gt; 00:03:25,840<br>We can push and pop things from a stack.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:25,840 –&gt; 00:03:28,879<br>And then we have a couple of different kinds of jumps.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:28,879 –&gt; 00:03:33,680<br>We have a comparison and jump where we compare the values of two registers and then conditionally</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:33,680 –&gt; 00:03:35,439<br>jump to a label.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:35,439 –&gt; 00:03:37,319<br>We have unconditional jumps.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:37,319 –&gt; 00:03:40,800<br>And finally, there are labels, the targets of jumps.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:40,800 –&gt; 00:03:43,479<br>And the identifiers here are the register names.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:43,479 –&gt; 00:03:49,879<br>And we could also use immediate values on the right-hand side of operations instead of registers.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:49,879 –&gt; 00:03:54,079<br>And the typical operators, we’re just going to assume some typical family of operators,</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:54,079 –&gt; 00:03:58,879<br>like plus, minus times, et cetera.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:58,879 –&gt; 00:04:03,000<br>Now optimizations typically work on groups of statements.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:03,000 –&gt; 00:04:08,360<br>And one of the most important and useful statement groupings is the basic block.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:08,360 –&gt; 00:04:11,120<br>So a basic block is a sequence of instructions.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:11,120 –&gt; 00:04:14,520<br>And typically, we want it to be the longest possible sequence of instructions.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:14,520 –&gt; 00:04:16,319<br>So we want it to be maximal.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:16,319 –&gt; 00:04:19,120<br>And this sequence has two properties.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:19,120 –&gt; 00:04:23,480<br>First of all, there are no labels except possibly for the very first instruction.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:23,480 –&gt; 00:04:28,920<br>And there are no jumps anywhere in the sequence of instructions except possibly for the last</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:28,920 –&gt; 00:04:30,839<br>instruction.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:30,839 –&gt; 00:04:36,079<br>And the basic block, the idea behind a basic block, and the reason we require these two properties,</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:36,079 –&gt; 00:04:39,079<br>is that it’s guaranteed to flow.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:39,079 –&gt; 00:04:43,079<br>The execution is guaranteed to proceed from the first statement in the block to the last</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:43,079 –&gt; 00:04:44,079<br>statement in the block.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:44,079 –&gt; 00:04:49,479<br>So the flow of control within a basic block is completely predictable.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:49,479 –&gt; 00:04:53,359<br>Once we enter the block, once we begin at the first statement of the block, which might</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:53,359 –&gt; 00:05:00,319<br>have a label, there will be a sequence of statements that must all execute before we</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:00,319 –&gt; 00:05:04,920<br>reach the last statement, which could potentially be a jump to some other part of the code.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:04,920 –&gt; 00:05:09,519<br>But once we get here, once we get to this very first statement, that we’re guaranteed</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:09,519 –&gt; 00:05:13,920<br>to execute the entire block without jumping out.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:13,920 –&gt; 00:05:15,800<br>And furthermore, there’s no way to jump into the block.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:15,800 –&gt; 00:05:20,120<br>You couldn’t just come from some other random part of the program and begin executions,</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:20,120 –&gt; 00:05:22,079<br>say, at the second or third instruction.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:22,079 –&gt; 00:05:26,519<br>The only way into the block is through the first statement, and the only way out is through</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:26,519 –&gt; 00:05:28,480<br>the last statement.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:29,480 –&gt; 00:05:32,480<br>So here’s an example, basic block.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:32,480 –&gt; 00:05:39,240<br>And just to show you why basic blocks are useful, let’s observe that we can actually optimize</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:39,240 –&gt; 00:05:40,720<br>this piece of code.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:40,720 –&gt; 00:05:46,200<br>Because three always executes after two, this instruction here, always executes after this</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:46,200 –&gt; 00:05:52,120<br>instruction, we could change that third instruction to be w equals three times x.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:52,120 –&gt; 00:05:58,519<br>Because we can see here that t is getting x plus x or two times x, and here we’re adding</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:58,519 –&gt; 00:06:04,000<br>in another x, and so w is actually always equal to three times x.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:04,000 –&gt; 00:06:09,840<br>And a question then, so that is certainly a correct optimization, and it’s correct exactly</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:09,840 –&gt; 00:06:15,759<br>because statement 2 is always guaranteed to execute before statement 3.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:15,759 –&gt; 00:06:18,959<br>Another question we might be is whether we could eliminate this statement.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:18,959 –&gt; 00:06:27,560<br>So once we replace this by three times x, you know, maybe we don’t need this assignment</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:27,560 –&gt; 00:06:28,560<br>anymore.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:28,560 –&gt; 00:06:32,759<br>This was the only place that t was used, if t was a temporary value that was computed</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:32,759 –&gt; 00:06:38,479<br>only to compute the value w, and then we can delete this statement.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:38,479 –&gt; 00:06:40,959<br>And this depends on the rest of the program.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:40,959 –&gt; 00:06:46,319<br>We have to know whether t has any other uses someplace else in the program, which we can’t</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:46,319 –&gt; 00:06:51,079<br>see just by looking at the single basic block.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:51,079 –&gt; 00:06:56,199<br>The next important grouping of statements is a control flow graph, and a control flow graph</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:56,199 –&gt; 00:06:59,560<br>is a just a graph of basic blocks.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:59,560 –&gt; 00:07:05,360<br>And so there is an edge from block a to block b, if execution can pass from the last instruction</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:05,360 –&gt; 00:07:08,319<br>in a to the first instruction of b.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:08,319 –&gt; 00:07:12,399<br>So essentially the control flow graph just shows how control flow can pass between the</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:12,399 –&gt; 00:07:13,399<br>blocks.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:13,479 –&gt; 00:07:16,399<br>And there isn’t, of course, no interesting control flow within a block.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:16,399 –&gt; 00:07:21,399<br>We know that the basic block will just execute from the first instruction to the last instruction.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:21,399 –&gt; 00:07:28,560<br>So the control flow graph is a way of summarizing the interesting decision points in a procedure</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:28,560 –&gt; 00:07:36,319<br>or other piece of code showing where some interesting control flow decision is actually made.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:36,319 –&gt; 00:07:38,359<br>So here’s a simple control flow graph.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:38,360 –&gt; 00:07:40,680<br>We consist of two basic blocks.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:40,680 –&gt; 00:07:45,840<br>The first basic block is outside of a loop and consists of some initialization code.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:45,840 –&gt; 00:07:48,680<br>And then we have one basic block here in the loop.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:48,680 –&gt; 00:07:51,639<br>The basic block consists of these three instructions.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:51,639 –&gt; 00:07:57,080<br>The bottom of the block is a branch, or a testing branch, where either we exit and go</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:57,080 –&gt; 00:08:04,759<br>someplace else or we loop around and execute the loop body again.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:04,759 –&gt; 00:08:08,719<br>And the body of a method can always be represented as a control flow graph.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:08,719 –&gt; 00:08:11,599<br>The convention that we’ll use is always a distinguished entry node.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:11,599 –&gt; 00:08:14,319<br>So there’s a distinguished start node of the control flow graph.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:14,319 –&gt; 00:08:17,439<br>And typically it’ll just be obvious to be the one listed at the top.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:17,439 –&gt; 00:08:23,000<br>And then there’ll be some return nodes or one, some nodes which you can return from.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:23,000 –&gt; 00:08:25,879<br>And you know, you have every turn statements in the procedure.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:25,879 –&gt; 00:08:31,560<br>And return nodes or places where you exit the procedure will always be terminal, meaning</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:31,560 –&gt; 00:08:36,799<br>there’ll be no edges out of those blocks.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:36,799 –&gt; 00:08:41,799<br>Now the purpose of optimization is to improve a program’s resource utilization.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:41,799 –&gt; 00:08:46,320<br>And for the purposes of this class, when we talk about optimization in our examples and</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:46,320 –&gt; 00:08:49,279<br>in the videos, we’re going to be talking about execution time.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:49,279 –&gt; 00:08:52,919<br>Now we’re going to be talking about making the program run faster.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:52,919 –&gt; 00:08:55,879<br>And this is mostly what people are interested in.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:55,879 –&gt; 00:09:01,080<br>So most compilers do spend quite a bit of effort on making programs run faster.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:01,080 –&gt; 00:09:05,639<br>But it’s important to realize that there are many other resources that we could optimize</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:05,639 –&gt; 00:09:06,639<br>for.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:06,639 –&gt; 00:09:11,840<br>And actually for any resource that you can imagine, there probably is a compiler out there</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:11,840 –&gt; 00:09:18,480<br>that spends some effort optimizing for it in certain domain, domains of application.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:18,480 –&gt; 00:09:22,800<br>So for example, there are compilers we might care about code size.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:22,800 –&gt; 00:09:25,560<br>We might care about the number of network messages sent.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:25,559 –&gt; 00:09:31,799<br>One of the things that are commonly optimized for our memory usage, disk accesses.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:31,799 –&gt; 00:09:37,679<br>So databases, for example, try to minimize the number of times you access the disk and</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:37,679 –&gt; 00:09:41,519<br>power for battery powered devices.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:41,519 –&gt; 00:09:46,159<br>And the important thing about optimization is that it should not alter what the program</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:46,159 –&gt; 00:09:47,159<br>computes.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:47,159 –&gt; 00:09:49,719<br>The answer still must be the same.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:49,719 –&gt; 00:09:55,239<br>So we’re allowed to improve the program’s resource utilization, but we can’t change what</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:55,240 –&gt; 00:10:00,639<br>the program will produce.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:00,639 –&gt; 00:10:05,240<br>For languages like C and Cool and all the languages that you’re probably familiar with, there</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:05,240 –&gt; 00:10:09,919<br>are three granularities of optimization that people typically talk about.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:09,919 –&gt; 00:10:11,840<br>One is called local optimization.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:11,840 –&gt; 00:10:15,519<br>And those are optimizations that apply to a basic block in isolation.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:15,519 –&gt; 00:10:20,600<br>So these are optimizations that occur within a single basic block.</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:20,600 –&gt; 00:10:22,759<br>And they’re what are called global optimizations.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:22,759 –&gt; 00:10:27,720<br>And this is really misnamed because it’s not global across the entire program.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:27,720 –&gt; 00:10:32,159<br>What people mean by global optimization is it implies to a control flow graph.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:32,159 –&gt; 00:10:35,320<br>It’s global across an entire function.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:35,320 –&gt; 00:10:41,200<br>So global optimizations would apply to a single function and optimize across all the basic</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:41,200 –&gt; 00:10:44,120<br>blocks of that function.</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:44,120 –&gt; 00:10:46,480<br>And finally, there are inter-procedural optimizations.</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:46,480 –&gt; 00:10:49,680<br>These are optimizations that work across method boundaries.</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:49,679 –&gt; 00:10:54,039<br>They take multiple functions and move things around to try to optimize the collection of</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:54,039 –&gt; 00:10:57,039<br>functions as a whole.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:57,039 –&gt; 00:10:58,439<br>Many compilers do one.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:58,439 –&gt; 00:11:01,959<br>In fact, almost all compilers do one.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:01,959 –&gt; 00:11:04,959<br>Many, many compilers today do two.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:04,959 –&gt; 00:11:07,079<br>But not very many actually do three.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:07,079 –&gt; 00:11:14,279<br>So you see decreasing numbers of compilers doing these optimizations as you move up in</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:14,279 –&gt; 00:11:15,919<br>the granularity.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:15,919 –&gt; 00:11:20,759<br>And partly that’s because the optimizations are more difficult to implement.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:20,759 –&gt; 00:11:24,599<br>So it’s just more work to implement the inter-procedural optimizations.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:24,599 –&gt; 00:11:32,240<br>But also because a lot of the payoff is in the more local optimizations.</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:32,240 –&gt; 00:11:36,759<br>So expanding on that last point a little bit more, it turns out that in practice, while</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:36,759 –&gt; 00:11:42,839<br>we know how to do many, many optimizations, often a conscious decision is made, not to</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:42,840 –&gt; 00:11:48,600<br>implement the fanciest optimization that is known in the research literature.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:48,600 –&gt; 00:11:53,240<br>And that’s kind of an unfortunate thing from my point of view of being somebody who’s</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:53,240 –&gt; 00:11:57,080<br>really likes compilers and spend a lot of time thinking about optimization.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:57,080 –&gt; 00:12:02,040<br>And maybe it’s a little bit hard to accept for their professional compiler researchers</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:02,040 –&gt; 00:12:07,720<br>that people don’t always want to implement the latest and greatest optimizations.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:07,720 –&gt; 00:12:11,639<br>But it’s worth understanding why that might not be the case.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:11,639 –&gt; 00:12:14,799<br>And it boils down, essentially, to software engineering.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:14,799 –&gt; 00:12:17,039<br>Some of these optimizations are really hard to implement.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:17,039 –&gt; 00:12:19,360<br>I mean, they’re just complicated to implement.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:19,360 –&gt; 00:12:22,360<br>Some of the optimizations are costly in compilation time.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:22,360 –&gt; 00:12:29,319<br>So even though the compiling happens offline, it’s not part of the running of the program.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:29,319 –&gt; 00:12:35,439<br>The program still has to wait while the optimizing compiler does its compilation.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:35,439 –&gt; 00:12:41,519<br>And if it takes hours or in some cases days to optimize a program, that’s not the</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:41,519 –&gt; 00:12:43,120<br>necessarily great.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:43,120 –&gt; 00:12:47,039<br>And some of these optimizations have low payoff.</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:47,039 –&gt; 00:12:52,600<br>They might always improve the program, but they might only do it by a very small amount.</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:52,600 –&gt; 00:12:57,439<br>And unfortunately, many of the fanciest optimizations in the literature have all three of these</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:57,439 –&gt; 00:12:58,439<br>properties.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:58,439 –&gt; 00:12:59,439<br>They’re complicated.</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:59,439 –&gt; 00:13:02,679<br>They take a long time to run, and they don’t do very much.</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:02,679 –&gt; 00:13:09,319<br>And so it’s not so surprising that not all of these get implemented in production compilers.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:09,320 –&gt; 00:13:13,280<br>And this actually points out what the real goal is an optimization.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:13,280 –&gt; 00:13:16,800<br>What we really want is maximum benefit for minimum cost.</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:16,800 –&gt; 00:13:19,760<br>We’re really talking about a cost-benefit ratio.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:19,760 –&gt; 00:13:25,440<br>So optimization costs a certain amount in code complexity, complexity of the compiler,</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:25,440 –&gt; 00:13:30,320<br>in programmer time, waiting for the compiler to run.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:30,320 –&gt; 00:13:34,960<br>And the benefit, they have now that it improves the program, has to be sufficient to justify</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:34,960 –&gt; 00:13:35,960<br>those costs.</p>
