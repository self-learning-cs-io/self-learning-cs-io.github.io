                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,600<br>Now that we’ve learned about CSMA CD, I’m going to tell you about Ethernet.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,600 –&gt; 00:00:09,919<br>Ethernet started in the early 1970s, originally at around 10 megabits per second,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:09,919 –&gt; 00:00:15,359<br>but has evolved a long way since then. In this first place, CSMA CD was right at</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:15,359 –&gt; 00:00:21,039<br>the heart of how Ethernet worked, and determined how many hosts would share a</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,039 –&gt; 00:00:25,160<br>single cable. We’ll see later that it became less important as the speed went up.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,160 –&gt; 00:00:29,640<br>The original Ethernet looked like this. These are two pictures that were drawn by</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:29,640 –&gt; 00:00:35,759<br>Bob Metcalf, one of the co-inventors of Ethernet back in the early 70s. He was</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:35,759 –&gt; 00:00:40,240<br>working at Xerox Park at the time. He later went on to found three-com. So on the</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:40,240 –&gt; 00:00:43,719<br>left is showing the original topology that they had in mind of both wired and</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:43,719 –&gt; 00:00:48,200<br>wireless Ethernet. And on the right shows the specifics of how the first Ethernet</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,200 –&gt; 00:00:52,240<br>network was built. There was this big thick yellow cable. It was always yellow. It</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:52,240 –&gt; 00:00:55,880<br>was very, very thick and inflexible and snaked around in the ceiling or in the</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:55,880 –&gt; 00:01:00,640<br>walls or under the floor. And then these big taps would be screwed down into the</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:00,640 –&gt; 00:01:05,240<br>cable to make an electrical contact for an interface and then a computer. It</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:05,240 –&gt; 00:01:09,640<br>became much simpler over time, ending up with what we used today. This is the</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:09,640 –&gt; 00:01:13,719<br>Ethernet frame format. This is the format of the frames that are put onto the</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:13,719 –&gt; 00:01:19,920<br>link. The first bit is shown on the left hand side, and it starts with a</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:19,920 –&gt; 00:01:25,120<br>preamble. The preamble is a sequence of ones and zeros just there to train the</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:25,120 –&gt; 00:01:28,600<br>clock recovery circuits to help them get started and to have recovered the</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:28,600 –&gt; 00:01:32,880<br>clock before the data actually starts to arrive. There’s a starter frame delimiter</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:32,880 –&gt; 00:01:36,880<br>which is a special symbol which tells us that the packet is just about to start</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:36,880 –&gt; 00:01:42,040<br>and we then go into the destination address which we already know to be a</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:42,040 –&gt; 00:01:47,159<br>48-bit address. This is a globally unique address assigned by the manufacturer</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:47,159 –&gt; 00:01:53,120<br>of the interface. One bit tells us whether it’s unicast or multicast and one</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:53,120 –&gt; 00:01:57,240<br>bit can be used in fact to make it a locally defined address although that’s</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:57,240 –&gt; 00:02:03,880<br>actually very unusual. So there’s 46 bits that are there to define the globally</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:03,880 –&gt; 00:02:08,560<br>unique address. And so there’s a very, very large number of Ethernet addresses to</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:08,560 –&gt; 00:02:12,920<br>use. The source address is just the address of the local host that’s sending</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:12,920 –&gt; 00:02:17,640<br>the frame in the usual sense. The type indicates what we’ll find inside the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:17,639 –&gt; 00:02:24,959<br>data. For example, the Ether type of hex 0800 is telling us that there’s IP</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:24,959 –&gt; 00:02:29,319<br>inside here which of course a very common case. You’ll recall that there is a</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:29,319 –&gt; 00:02:36,199<br>minimum size for any CSMACD based network, a minimum packet size. So we pad the</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:36,199 –&gt; 00:02:39,959<br>packet if the data is very short. We pad it to make sure that there are a</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:39,959 –&gt; 00:02:45,119<br>significant number of, there is sufficient number of bytes so that we can detect</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:45,120 –&gt; 00:02:48,719<br>collisions reliably before we’ve finished sending the packet. So they pad it</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:48,719 –&gt; 00:02:54,360<br>out to a minimum of 46 data bytes. So if the amount of data is over 46 then of</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:54,360 –&gt; 00:02:58,719<br>course it won’t pad it but otherwise it will pad it just to make sure that</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:58,719 –&gt; 00:03:03,120<br>there’s enough. And finally there’s what’s called a cyclic redundancy check, CRC</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:03,120 –&gt; 00:03:08,080<br>or the frame check sequence. The CRC is checking the sequence using a code like</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:08,080 –&gt; 00:03:13,319<br>we saw in the error detection videos that will tell us that whether or not there</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:13,319 –&gt; 00:03:17,639<br>was an error in the bits. For example if the bits were corrupted on the wire or in</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:17,639 –&gt; 00:03:23,439<br>the in the end host before it was processed. The original 10 megabits per second</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:23,439 –&gt; 00:03:28,919<br>ethernet was standardized by IEEE and goes by the standard of IEEE</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:28,919 –&gt; 00:03:35,280<br>802.3. You’ll often hear ethernet being referred to as a .3 network for this</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:35,280 –&gt; 00:03:40,280<br>reason just as an abbreviation of 802.3. And this was just the standard’s body name</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:40,280 –&gt; 00:03:45,319<br>that was used to write the spec that defined the correct operation of ethernet.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:45,319 –&gt; 00:03:49,639<br>So it has really two components. It has the MAC protocol and the frame structure</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:49,639 –&gt; 00:03:54,680<br>that we’ve just seen. And then underneath you had a different options for the</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:54,680 –&gt; 00:03:58,520<br>physical layer that could be used. There was originally the what’s called the</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:58,520 –&gt; 00:04:03,800<br>10 base 5 which was that big thick yellow cable that I described earlier and</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:03,800 –&gt; 00:04:08,120<br>that went out of fashion quite a long time ago. Then that was replaced by a</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:08,120 –&gt; 00:04:13,000<br>thin coaxial cable version that used the coaxial cable similar to the RF cables</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:13,000 –&gt; 00:04:20,360<br>we use for TV. But what really really transformed ethernet was when it started to</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:20,360 –&gt; 00:04:26,120<br>use this type of cable here. This is the RJ45 cable that we’re all very familiar</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:26,120 –&gt; 00:04:31,000<br>with. And that was not because of the connector. It was because of the type of cable</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:31,000 –&gt; 00:04:34,759<br>that it can use and also the topology of the network. And we’ll see that in a</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:34,759 –&gt; 00:04:37,719<br>moment. But basically it started to run over voice grade,</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:37,719 –&gt; 00:04:42,439<br>unshielded twisted pair that was already present in the walls of many buildings.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:42,439 –&gt; 00:04:47,719<br>It’s called Category 3 telephone cable. It’s fairly low grade cable that was used for</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:47,719 –&gt; 00:04:53,719<br>connecting telephones to the exchange at a company. There’s also an optical fiber</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:53,719 –&gt; 00:04:58,039<br>version called 10 base F. It was originally used mostly by the military because</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:58,039 –&gt; 00:05:03,959<br>they’re harder to tap. There were two optical fibers and a single cable one for</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:04,199 –&gt; 00:05:10,359<br>each direction. Ethernet really took off when the 10 base T standard came along for running</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:10,359 –&gt; 00:05:15,639<br>ethernet over twisted pair. So 10 megabits per second was carried over the</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:15,639 –&gt; 00:05:21,479<br>Category 3 twisted pair telephone wires that already existed in pretty much every building in</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:21,479 –&gt; 00:05:27,719<br>the world. They were arranged in a star. In other words, those twisted pair cables would go to</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:27,719 –&gt; 00:05:33,319<br>a wiring closet on their way to the telephone exchange. So not only did the</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:33,319 –&gt; 00:05:38,920<br>twisted pair cable really help Ethernet be successful, but this topology of having an end host</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:38,920 –&gt; 00:05:46,040<br>connected by twisted pair into a hub. And a hub was a repeater. It would take every signal coming in</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:46,040 –&gt; 00:05:51,240<br>and then repeat it over every outgoing cable except for the one through which it entered.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:51,800 –&gt; 00:05:56,039<br>So it didn’t actually understand the packets. It would merely repeat them electrically.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:56,680 –&gt; 00:06:00,920<br>If there was a collision, then the collision would take place anywhere within here. It would be</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:00,920 –&gt; 00:06:05,560<br>detected and the hub would make sure that the voltage levels were sufficient to make sure that</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:05,560 –&gt; 00:06:13,240<br>it could be detected. Also, this centralized management in this hub, this would be managed</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:14,360 –&gt; 00:06:20,280<br>by the network administrator and this central management rather than the distributed management of</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:20,280 –&gt; 00:06:27,160<br>crawling under the floorboards or up in the attic made it much easier to manage Ethernet once</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:27,160 –&gt; 00:06:34,120<br>these hubs were placed in these central locations. So this led to a huge growth in Ethernet in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:35,240 –&gt; 00:06:40,200<br>Over the years, people wanted to make Ethernet faster and faster. So 10 megabits per second</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:40,200 –&gt; 00:06:45,160<br>gradually was increased to 100 megabits per second and then gigabit per second and more recently</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:45,160 –&gt; 00:06:49,400<br>10 gigabits per second. So a thousand times faster than the original Ethernet spec.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:50,440 –&gt; 00:06:56,920<br>One problem that we have to solve when increasing the size of Ethernet is if we’re using CSMA CD,</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:57,000 –&gt; 00:07:02,680<br>then we need to make sure that the that we keep this requirement that P over R is greater than or</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:02,680 –&gt; 00:07:09,080<br>equal to 2L over C. In other words, the duration of a packet is longer than the round trip times so</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:09,080 –&gt; 00:07:13,560<br>that we can make sure that we’re still transmitting a packet when a collision is detected.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:14,600 –&gt; 00:07:21,000<br>So when we increase the speed of the network, when we increase R in order for this to be true,</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:21,079 –&gt; 00:07:27,480<br>we either need to make P larger to counterbalance that increase in R or we need to make L smaller.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:28,040 –&gt; 00:07:33,959<br>And so this was a design choice when Ethernet was made faster. And the solution was to keep the</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:33,959 –&gt; 00:07:40,600<br>packet size the same because if we’d made the packet size 10 times larger from 64 bytes,</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:40,600 –&gt; 00:07:45,639<br>which was the original up to 640 bytes, then many of the packets that we’d like to send would be</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:45,639 –&gt; 00:07:50,199<br>smaller than that, things like acknowledgments and DNS queries, things like that. And so it would</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:50,199 –&gt; 00:07:56,279<br>be very inefficient. So the decision was to keep P the same, but to make L smaller.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:57,959 –&gt; 00:08:02,680<br>So 100 megabit per second Ethernet and gigabit per second Ethernet both have this</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:03,240 –&gt; 00:08:08,919<br>both have this requirement that L is limited to 100 meters. This turn out to be much easier with</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:08,919 –&gt; 00:08:14,599<br>the introduction of Ethernet switching as I’ll describe in a few minutes. So as we made it faster and</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:14,600 –&gt; 00:08:21,720<br>faster, the Ethernet Mac protocol stayed the same. That’s the framing structure and the way in</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:21,720 –&gt; 00:08:27,000<br>which we decide when to send packets under the wire. That stayed the same for a while.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:28,200 –&gt; 00:08:34,120<br>And 100 megabit per second Ethernet was called fast Ethernet. It doesn’t seem so fast these days.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:34,120 –&gt; 00:08:40,600<br>And there were two standards for the physical layer, 100 base TX, which was the coding structure</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:40,600 –&gt; 00:08:47,800<br>used for twisted pair cable and then 100 base FX for optical fiber. On the 100 base TX,</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:47,800 –&gt; 00:08:53,960<br>it uses Category 5 cable again and the same RJ45 connector that we’ve seen. It actually started</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:53,960 –&gt; 00:09:00,680<br>to be full duplex, meaning there were two pairs that were used rather than just one within the cable.</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:01,399 –&gt; 00:09:05,000<br>One pair was used for 100 megabits per second signaling in each direction.</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:05,799 –&gt; 00:09:12,039<br>Instead of using the Manchester encoding, it started to use 4B5B encoding, which we saw as they</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:12,039 –&gt; 00:09:18,600<br>means to introduce transitions for clock recovery. We saw that in the video about clocks.</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:19,080 –&gt; 00:09:22,440<br>And of course it was limited to a distance of 100 meters.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:23,559 –&gt; 00:09:31,799<br>Then later came along the one gigabit Ethernet standard. There was the 1000 base T and the 1000 base FX.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:32,279 –&gt; 00:09:41,000<br>That should be 1000 base T. The 1000 base T standard also runs over Category 5 cable using the RJ45</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:41,000 –&gt; 00:09:47,079<br>connector. As many of the laptops and serves that are sold today, the Ethernet in them is 1 gigabit per</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:47,079 –&gt; 00:09:55,319<br>second or 1000 base T. It turns out it’s very hard to carry a 1 gigabit per second signal over a</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:55,320 –&gt; 00:10:03,080<br>Category 5 cable. They actually use 4 pairs inside the cable. They carry signals in both directions</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:03,080 –&gt; 00:10:09,160<br>at the same time over all 4 pairs. There’s no room for anything else on this cable. It can only be</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:09,160 –&gt; 00:10:14,840<br>used for the gigabit Ethernet. It uses a very complex coding, which is beyond the level of what we’re</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:14,840 –&gt; 00:10:21,800<br>going to be describing in this class. Instead of just using a binary on-off as it was used in the</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:21,799 –&gt; 00:10:27,799<br>original 10 megabits per second Ethernet, it uses 5 different levels to try and pack as much</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:27,799 –&gt; 00:10:35,240<br>signal as much information onto the cable as it can. And as before the distance is limited to 100 meters.</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:36,679 –&gt; 00:10:45,079<br>By the late 1980s, 10 base T Ethernet was extremely popular. There was already work going on on 100</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:45,079 –&gt; 00:10:49,319<br>megabit per second Ethernet and it was clear that the networks would get faster and faster.</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:49,800 –&gt; 00:10:55,879<br>The hubs and the repeaters in the wiring closets meant that the network could be really quite large</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:55,879 –&gt; 00:11:03,480<br>and were being deployed on a very large scale. But it was clear also that for faster and faster</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:03,480 –&gt; 00:11:09,160<br>networks each of the segments was going to get very very short just down to 100 meters. So with a</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:09,160 –&gt; 00:11:15,880<br>large number of hosts sharing a small network, the networks tended to be overwhelmed with the</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:15,879 –&gt; 00:11:20,600<br>number of collisions that they would see because there were just so many hosts all trying to talk</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:20,600 –&gt; 00:11:25,879<br>on the same network. And so it became natural to try and partition those Ethernet networks to reduce</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:25,879 –&gt; 00:11:30,039<br>the number of collisions, what’s often referred to as reducing the collision domain.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:32,120 –&gt; 00:11:36,759<br>At the same time, cost of switching hardware was coming down. It became easier to build</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:36,759 –&gt; 00:11:43,240<br>ASICs or specialized chips for doing the switching. And so all of these things together led to</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:43,240 –&gt; 00:11:50,759<br>partitioning networks using Ethernet switches. So with a hub or a repeater, every time a packet is sent,</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:50,759 –&gt; 00:11:57,639<br>the whole medium of all of these five links would become busy and would be used up. So within this</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:57,639 –&gt; 00:12:03,159<br>circle here, the entire capacity is say 10 megabits per second or 100 megabits per second depending</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:03,159 –&gt; 00:12:09,320<br>on the on the rate. So with large networks, with say hundreds of end hosts all connected to a hub</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:09,400 –&gt; 00:12:14,120<br>or a set of hubs, this would be very limiting in the total overall capacity that they had to use.</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:15,080 –&gt; 00:12:20,680<br>What if we could allow several communications to take place at the same time? So for example,</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:20,680 –&gt; 00:12:27,160<br>if A wants to talk to B at the same time that C is talking to D, because they’re talking to</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:27,160 –&gt; 00:12:32,120<br>different hosts, different sets of hosts, why don’t we allow this by allowing the communications</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:32,120 –&gt; 00:12:38,520<br>to take place independently? So instead of the hub repeating the signal just as an electrical</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:38,519 –&gt; 00:12:43,240<br>signal, what if it was to actually interpret the packets, send the packets only to the correct</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:43,240 –&gt; 00:12:49,079<br>destination just like a router does, but based on the Ethernet addresses rather than the IP addresses.</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:49,079 –&gt; 00:12:54,039<br>So this is what was called a switch. Before being called Ethernet switches, they were called</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:54,039 –&gt; 00:12:59,559<br>bridges. You will see those referred to sometimes, but we’re just going to call them Ethernet switches.</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:00,679 –&gt; 00:13:06,120<br>So the basic operation is if A is sending to B, the packet will flow down to the switch. The switch</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:06,120 –&gt; 00:13:10,519<br>will look at the Ethernet address, decide where to send it next. If it has it in its table,</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:10,519 –&gt; 00:13:15,159<br>then it will forward it to B, and at the same time, perhaps, C is sending a packet to D, and the same</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:15,159 –&gt; 00:13:21,720<br>thing will be happening over here independently. So the collisions now are just held within a single</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:21,720 –&gt; 00:13:26,200<br>cable. So if they happen to be signals going in both directions on the cable at the same time,</p>
<p>145<br>00:13:26,200 –&gt; 00:13:30,600<br>that might cause a collision. Although at the same time, there was also introduced something</p>
<p>146<br>00:13:30,600 –&gt; 00:13:36,600<br>called full duplex Ethernet, which was exploiting the fact that communications could take place on</p>
<p>147<br>00:13:36,600 –&gt; 00:13:42,200<br>the cable in both directions without colliding with each other at the same time. And so now the switch</p>
<p>148<br>00:13:42,200 –&gt; 00:13:48,040<br>could operate without the use of CSMACD completely once the switches were introduced and all of the</p>
<p>149<br>00:13:48,040 –&gt; 00:13:56,440<br>links were full duplex. So this led to the very first Ethernet switches being developed in the</p>
<p>150<br>00:13:56,440 –&gt; 00:14:02,920<br>early 1990s, and nearly all Ethernet networks today are based on Ethernet switches. It’s very</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:02,920 –&gt; 00:14:09,160<br>unusual to see an Ethernet hub these days. In fact, for one gigabit per second and 10 gigabits per</p>
<p>152<br>00:14:09,160 –&gt; 00:14:14,680<br>second Ethernet, there’s no choice. All those networks are switched. So the advantages are multiple</p>
<p>153<br>00:14:14,680 –&gt; 00:14:20,840<br>concurrent communications. Full duplex links, they can send and receive at the same time. And also,</p>
<p>154<br>00:14:20,840 –&gt; 00:14:26,200<br>there’s a management benefit that if there are dead or faulty end hosts, they could be isolated</p>
<p>155<br>00:14:26,200 –&gt; 00:14:31,720<br>by the switch. You could just switch off the link and then isolate it from the network completely</p>
<p>156<br>00:14:31,720 –&gt; 00:14:41,879<br>to prevent it from harming any other switches in the network. So Ethernet switches have become</p>
<p>157<br>00:14:41,879 –&gt; 00:14:48,520<br>the main way that Ethernet is put into deployment today is just a picture of an Ethernet switch at</p>
<p>158<br>00:14:48,520 –&gt; 00:14:54,200<br>Stanford. This is the Ethernet switch over here with all these cables coming out going into patch</p>
<p>159<br>00:14:54,200 –&gt; 00:15:00,600<br>panels here that go off to different offices in the in the building. So the way that an Ethernet</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:00,600 –&gt; 00:15:06,759<br>switch works does it does some sort of very simple operations. First is first is that it does</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:06,759 –&gt; 00:15:11,879<br>forwarding and learning. We’ve seen this before. It forwards packets based on its forwarding table</p>
<p>162<br>00:15:11,879 –&gt; 00:15:18,360<br>and then it learns the contents of that forwarding table based on addresses that it’s seen. So when a</p>
<p>163<br>00:15:18,360 –&gt; 00:15:25,639<br>frame arrives, first of all examines the header of each arriving frame to check for the destination</p>
<p>164<br>00:15:25,639 –&gt; 00:15:30,360<br>address. If the Ethernet destination address is in its forwarding table, it will forward the frame</p>
<p>165<br>00:15:30,360 –&gt; 00:15:37,000<br>to the correct outgoing port or if it’s multicast the set of ports. If the Ethernet destination address</p>
<p>166<br>00:15:37,000 –&gt; 00:15:43,080<br>is not in its table, it will broadcast the frame to all ports of the switch except the one through</p>
<p>167<br>00:15:43,080 –&gt; 00:15:50,280<br>which the frame arrived. And then entries in the table are learned by examining the Ethernet’s</p>
<p>168<br>00:15:50,280 –&gt; 00:15:55,400<br>source address of arriving packets. So it’ll take the source address, look it up in the table if it</p>
<p>169<br>00:15:55,400 –&gt; 00:16:00,520<br>finds that it’s not there. It’ll populate the table with that entry that says, okay, if ever I see</p>
<p>170<br>00:16:00,520 –&gt; 00:16:05,879<br>this as a destination address, I now know how I reach it by sending it back out of the port that</p>
<p>171<br>00:16:05,879 –&gt; 00:16:11,800<br>this address is connected to. So that way next time the frame won’t be broadcast, it’ll just be</p>
<p>172<br>00:16:11,799 –&gt; 00:16:16,759<br>sent on to its correct destination. So that’s the forwarding and learning function of an Ethernet</p>
<p>173<br>00:16:16,759 –&gt; 00:16:22,439<br>switch. And then there’s also the topology maintenance. It runs the spanning tree protocol where it</p>
<p>174<br>00:16:22,439 –&gt; 00:16:28,519<br>exchanges those things called bridge protocol data units, the BPDUs that we saw in the spanning</p>
<p>175<br>00:16:28,519 –&gt; 00:16:34,519<br>tree video. And it runs the spanning tree protocol to talk to the other switches to create a loop-free</p>
<p>176<br>00:16:35,399 –&gt; 00:16:43,000<br>topology. So that allows it to decide which ports to enable or block to make sure that it creates</p>
<p>177<br>00:16:43,000 –&gt; 00:16:48,759<br>a loop-free spanning tree amongst all of the switches in the network. As a consequence, Ethernet</p>
<p>178<br>00:16:48,759 –&gt; 00:16:57,240<br>switches are very, very widely deployed in here’s an example of how that might look in say a university</p>
<p>179<br>00:16:57,240 –&gt; 00:17:03,319<br>campus. There’s pretty much how our college networks looks at Stanford inside each building.</p>
<p>180<br>00:17:03,320 –&gt; 00:17:09,400<br>So this might be a building or one floor of the building. This could be the third floor of my</p>
<p>181<br>00:17:09,400 –&gt; 00:17:15,240<br>building and the gates building at Stanford. This could be the second floor. There’s another switch</p>
<p>182<br>00:17:15,240 –&gt; 00:17:22,039<br>for that floor. And then they connect into the building router. They would often be connected in</p>
<p>183<br>00:17:22,680 –&gt; 00:17:29,400<br>to another router in another building for fault torrents in case the the building router was to fail.</p>
<p>184<br>00:17:30,280 –&gt; 00:17:37,080<br>And this router might be running OSPF for routing packets around on our across our campus.</p>
<p>185<br>00:17:37,800 –&gt; 00:17:44,680<br>So these routers form the campus backbone that spread all across our college campus.</p>
<p>186<br>00:17:45,560 –&gt; 00:17:51,160<br>And then they would eventually connect to a BGP router that connects to the public internet.</p>
<p>187<br>00:17:51,160 –&gt; 00:17:57,880<br>So this is speaking the BGP protocol to the outside world to exchange prefixes for paths to</p>
<p>188<br>00:17:57,880 –&gt; 00:18:03,640<br>the outside world. So Ethernet switches can connect many, many hosts. Sometimes hundreds of hosts</p>
<p>189<br>00:18:03,640 –&gt; 00:18:09,720<br>together. There are switches available with hundreds of ports that then connect perhaps all of the</p>
<p>190<br>00:18:09,720 –&gt; 00:18:15,960<br>end hosts in the building or in the floor of the building. So in summary, medium access control</p>
<p>191<br>00:18:15,960 –&gt; 00:18:22,040<br>protocols come in two main flavors. Random access and deterministic. Random access protocols proved</p>
<p>192<br>00:18:22,039 –&gt; 00:18:26,839<br>very popular because they’re nice and simple. They give transmitting hosts a nice quick load</p>
<p>193<br>00:18:26,839 –&gt; 00:18:34,519<br>delay access to the network when it’s being lightly used. And over the years, CSMACD became the most</p>
<p>194<br>00:18:34,519 –&gt; 00:18:39,639<br>popular. It’s a simple access protocol that was used in the first 10 megabit per second version</p>
<p>195<br>00:18:39,639 –&gt; 00:18:44,599<br>of Ethernet. Over the years, Ethernet standards emerged for 100 megabits per second Ethernet.</p>
<p>196<br>00:18:44,599 –&gt; 00:18:49,799<br>That’s called fast Ethernet. And then gigabit per second Ethernet. And more recently, 10 gigabits per</p>
<p>197<br>00:18:49,799 –&gt; 00:18:57,639<br>second. Limits on the link size and the need for more capacity meant that CSMACD was gradually</p>
<p>198<br>00:18:57,639 –&gt; 00:19:04,359<br>replaced by Ethernet switching in which end hosts typically connect over a full duplex link.</p>
<p>199<br>00:19:04,359 –&gt; 00:19:10,599<br>And so can both send and receive at the same time. And Ethernet switches do pretty much full routing</p>
<p>200<br>00:19:10,599 –&gt; 00:19:15,960<br>like a router does, but on the Ethernet addresses, they learn the Ethernet addresses to populate their</p>
<p>201<br>00:19:15,960 –&gt; 00:19:22,519<br>tables by learning the source address of packets that go by. And that way, they build up a nice,</p>
<p>202<br>00:19:22,519 –&gt; 00:19:26,519<br>simple forwarding table. And then they use the spanning tree protocol to build a loop-free</p>
<p>203<br>00:19:26,519 –&gt; 00:19:32,200<br>topology connecting all the switches within the network. So as a consequence, Ethernet switches</p>
<p>204<br>00:19:32,200 –&gt; 00:19:38,120<br>are ubiquitous today and used in pretty much every organization that has a wired network.</p>
