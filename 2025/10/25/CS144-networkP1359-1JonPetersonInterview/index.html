                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:03,000<br>So here I’m with John Peterson,</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:03,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,360<br>who’s an old friend of mine,</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:04,360 –&gt; 00:00:07,759<br>and actually a pretty important person in the internet.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:07,759 –&gt; 00:00:11,080<br>I thought we’d, and so you could,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:11,080 –&gt; 00:00:14,240<br>you could sort of ask John a bit about what’s going on today,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:14,240 –&gt; 00:00:15,839<br>some particularly interesting topics,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:15,839 –&gt; 00:00:16,679<br>but maybe she’d start with,</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:16,679 –&gt; 00:00:20,000<br>so how did you get involved in internet governance?</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:21,120 –&gt; 00:00:22,000<br>That’s a good question.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:22,000 –&gt; 00:00:24,120<br>So I was lucky enough to be around</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:24,120 –&gt; 00:00:27,400<br>in the Verde.com boom in the late 1990s,</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:27,399 –&gt; 00:00:30,199<br>and a small startup that I worked for in Boston</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:30,199 –&gt; 00:00:32,719<br>was acquired by level three communications.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:32,719 –&gt; 00:00:35,560<br>They moved me out to Scenic Boulder, Colorado,</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:35,560 –&gt; 00:00:37,519<br>where Phil actually was as well,</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:37,519 –&gt; 00:00:39,280<br>and it all roughly the same time.</p>
<p>17<br>00:00:39,280 –&gt; 00:00:41,000<br>And level three, of course,</p>
<p>18<br>00:00:41,000 –&gt; 00:00:44,560<br>is one of the two one background providers of the internet,</p>
<p>19<br>00:00:44,560 –&gt; 00:00:46,320<br>and they have a profound engagement</p>
<p>20<br>00:00:46,320 –&gt; 00:00:47,920<br>with the internet engineering task force</p>
<p>21<br>00:00:47,920 –&gt; 00:00:50,840<br>with the standard bodies that helped make the internet</p>
<p>22<br>00:00:50,840 –&gt; 00:00:53,560<br>to define how the internet works.</p>
<p>23<br>00:00:53,560 –&gt; 00:00:55,599<br>And when I got there,</p>
<p>24<br>00:00:55,600 –&gt; 00:00:58,000<br>that was one of the things actually that most attracted me</p>
<p>25<br>00:00:58,000 –&gt; 00:01:01,880<br>about this opportunity would be the ability to really work</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:01,880 –&gt; 00:01:03,880<br>with the top minds who were out there.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:03,880 –&gt; 00:01:06,799<br>And so I started attending the ITF.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:06,799 –&gt; 00:01:09,280<br>I’ve been mailing lists and things like that beforehand,</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:09,280 –&gt; 00:01:13,359<br>but I first started attending when I worked at level three,</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:13,359 –&gt; 00:01:18,359<br>and I just found it to be a fascinating community</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:19,000 –&gt; 00:01:21,040<br>that had such intellectual vigor</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:21,040 –&gt; 00:01:23,719<br>that just had so much interest in trying to find</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:23,719 –&gt; 00:01:25,400<br>the right solution.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:25,400 –&gt; 00:01:29,960<br>You don’t go to the ITF and represent a company,</p>
<p>35<br>00:01:29,960 –&gt; 00:01:31,840<br>you go there and you put forward what you think</p>
<p>36<br>00:01:31,840 –&gt; 00:01:34,320<br>is the best idea, and it’s really a place</p>
<p>37<br>00:01:34,320 –&gt; 00:01:36,400<br>where there is a meritocracy of ideas.</p>
<p>38<br>00:01:36,400 –&gt; 00:01:39,560<br>And once you get the bug for it, of course,</p>
<p>39<br>00:01:39,560 –&gt; 00:01:41,400<br>you discover there are all of these other dimensions</p>
<p>40<br>00:01:41,400 –&gt; 00:01:43,200<br>to make sure that governance,</p>
<p>41<br>00:01:43,200 –&gt; 00:01:44,520<br>if you’re there at the ITF,</p>
<p>42<br>00:01:44,520 –&gt; 00:01:46,719<br>you may end up dealing with the W3C,</p>
<p>43<br>00:01:46,719 –&gt; 00:01:48,040<br>if you work on applications,</p>
<p>44<br>00:01:48,040 –&gt; 00:01:50,320<br>if they have responsibility for the standards</p>
<p>45<br>00:01:50,320 –&gt; 00:01:53,280<br>of save at the world wide web, like HTML,</p>
<p>46<br>00:01:53,280 –&gt; 00:01:55,640<br>you may end up working with ICANN,</p>
<p>47<br>00:01:55,640 –&gt; 00:01:58,719<br>with the people that do domain name assignments,</p>
<p>48<br>00:01:58,719 –&gt; 00:02:01,280<br>and I kind of made the rounds of these</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:01,280 –&gt; 00:02:02,480<br>in government circles,</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:02,480 –&gt; 00:02:04,920<br>and working on the intersection between technology</p>
<p>51<br>00:02:04,920 –&gt; 00:02:06,760<br>and public policy tends to take you</p>
<p>52<br>00:02:06,760 –&gt; 00:02:08,159<br>to some pretty interesting places.</p>
<p>53<br>00:02:09,199 –&gt; 00:02:11,840<br>Well, so I think some of the first work that you did</p>
<p>54<br>00:02:11,840 –&gt; 00:02:15,080<br>with SIP, the session initiation protocol.</p>
<p>55<br>00:02:15,080 –&gt; 00:02:17,080<br>Do you want to talk a little bit about this IPs left and E</p>
<p>56<br>00:02:17,080 –&gt; 00:02:18,719<br>and kind of what that path was,</p>
<p>57<br>00:02:18,719 –&gt; 00:02:21,400<br>and sort of where SIP is today in your part?</p>
<p>58<br>00:02:21,400 –&gt; 00:02:22,240<br>And it was?</p>
<p>59<br>00:02:22,560 –&gt; 00:02:25,159<br>Some point I remember that in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>60<br>00:02:25,159 –&gt; 00:02:28,000<br>there really wasn’t anything like voice of a IP,</p>
<p>61<br>00:02:28,000 –&gt; 00:02:30,600<br>but there were some experimental technologies</p>
<p>62<br>00:02:30,600 –&gt; 00:02:33,800<br>people had rigged up that worked in some of the Unix</p>
<p>63<br>00:02:33,800 –&gt; 00:02:36,280<br>environments in labs in California and so on,</p>
<p>64<br>00:02:36,280 –&gt; 00:02:38,680<br>but there was no commercial product you could buy</p>
<p>65<br>00:02:38,680 –&gt; 00:02:40,400<br>that would let you talk to somebody else</p>
<p>66<br>00:02:40,400 –&gt; 00:02:41,600<br>over the internet.</p>
<p>67<br>00:02:41,600 –&gt; 00:02:44,680<br>Remember as well that in the mid 1990s,</p>
<p>68<br>00:02:44,680 –&gt; 00:02:47,520<br>a lot of computers didn’t have adequate sound cards,</p>
<p>69<br>00:02:47,520 –&gt; 00:02:49,520<br>or certainly wasn’t adequate video capture,</p>
<p>70<br>00:02:50,480 –&gt; 00:02:55,280<br>and network interfaces were spotty at best,</p>
<p>71<br>00:02:55,280 –&gt; 00:02:58,680<br>and the actual commercial services you could purchase,</p>
<p>72<br>00:02:58,680 –&gt; 00:03:02,000<br>especially at the consumer level,</p>
<p>73<br>00:03:02,000 –&gt; 00:03:04,080<br>to get enough bandwidth to communicate over the internet</p>
<p>74<br>00:03:04,080 –&gt; 00:03:06,280<br>something like voice of a IP, they didn’t really exist.</p>
<p>75<br>00:03:06,280 –&gt; 00:03:10,160<br>So sometime around 1996, 1997, we’d hit a sweet spot</p>
<p>76<br>00:03:10,160 –&gt; 00:03:11,760<br>where the computing power was there,</p>
<p>77<br>00:03:11,760 –&gt; 00:03:14,719<br>the network was there, computers tended to have</p>
<p>78<br>00:03:14,719 –&gt; 00:03:16,120<br>the right interfaces to do this,</p>
<p>79<br>00:03:16,120 –&gt; 00:03:18,800<br>and so we started to see the first commercial voice of a IP</p>
<p>80<br>00:03:19,080 –&gt; 00:03:21,080<br>offering around that time.</p>
<p>81<br>00:03:21,080 –&gt; 00:03:25,160<br>When I started working on this around then, 96, 97,</p>
<p>82<br>00:03:25,160 –&gt; 00:03:28,600<br>I worked on the infrastructure dimension of this,</p>
<p>83<br>00:03:28,600 –&gt; 00:03:30,960<br>the startup that I worked for in Boston was focused</p>
<p>84<br>00:03:30,960 –&gt; 00:03:33,520<br>on the particular problem of how you could take</p>
<p>85<br>00:03:33,520 –&gt; 00:03:34,800<br>a traditional telephone switch,</p>
<p>86<br>00:03:34,800 –&gt; 00:03:38,080<br>and these telephones which is made by companies like Nortel</p>
<p>87<br>00:03:38,080 –&gt; 00:03:42,439<br>and the time Hussainte, they were a noravis expensive,</p>
<p>88<br>00:03:42,439 –&gt; 00:03:45,320<br>monolithic, special purpose devices,</p>
<p>89<br>00:03:45,319 –&gt; 00:03:48,799<br>that required a ton of operational oversight,</p>
<p>90<br>00:03:48,799 –&gt; 00:03:51,039<br>it didn’t really fit into the internet software model</p>
<p>91<br>00:03:51,039 –&gt; 00:03:54,079<br>or the internet disruptive innovation</p>
<p>92<br>00:03:54,079 –&gt; 00:03:57,400<br>that we all associate with technology today.</p>
<p>93<br>00:03:57,400 –&gt; 00:04:00,039<br>And so I was one of the first people to work on something</p>
<p>94<br>00:04:00,039 –&gt; 00:04:03,280<br>called soft switching, the idea that you could just take</p>
<p>95<br>00:04:03,280 –&gt; 00:04:06,319<br>a general purpose computer, take a sunbox, a unique box,</p>
<p>96<br>00:04:06,319 –&gt; 00:04:10,319<br>and put the control plane logic for a telephone switch</p>
<p>97<br>00:04:10,319 –&gt; 00:04:13,639<br>on a box like that, and just have it control telephone</p>
<p>98<br>00:04:13,639 –&gt; 00:04:15,439<br>resources that actually handled switching</p>
<p>99<br>00:04:15,439 –&gt; 00:04:18,800<br>little circuits from one customer to another</p>
<p>100<br>00:04:18,800 –&gt; 00:04:20,919<br>to handle those as dumb devices.</p>
<p>101<br>00:04:20,919 –&gt; 00:04:24,919<br>And this created an extremely disruptive influence</p>
<p>102<br>00:04:24,919 –&gt; 00:04:26,519<br>on the telephone switch market.</p>
<p>103<br>00:04:26,519 –&gt; 00:04:29,360<br>And today, I think it’d be safe to say</p>
<p>104<br>00:04:29,360 –&gt; 00:04:31,319<br>that it’s become dominant paraglimant</p>
<p>105<br>00:04:31,319 –&gt; 00:04:34,000<br>that you actually can’t really buy things like these</p>
<p>106<br>00:04:34,000 –&gt; 00:04:37,560<br>Nortel switches anymore except on the secondary market.</p>
<p>107<br>00:04:37,560 –&gt; 00:04:40,159<br>If you own one and you need replacement parts today,</p>
<p>108<br>00:04:40,159 –&gt; 00:04:42,399<br>you pretty much have to get them on you pay.</p>
<p>109<br>00:04:42,399 –&gt; 00:04:44,560<br>If you need new line parts and things like that.</p>
<p>110<br>00:04:46,039 –&gt; 00:04:48,120<br>Now, once you build a soft switch,</p>
<p>111<br>00:04:48,120 –&gt; 00:04:51,439<br>naturally these sunboxes or other Phoenix boxes,</p>
<p>112<br>00:04:51,439 –&gt; 00:04:52,879<br>they have internet access.</p>
<p>113<br>00:04:52,879 –&gt; 00:04:55,239<br>And you need to have ways for these switches</p>
<p>114<br>00:04:55,239 –&gt; 00:04:57,959<br>to talk to one another to be able to coordinate calls</p>
<p>115<br>00:04:57,959 –&gt; 00:05:02,319<br>that don’t use the outdated X25 based SS7 systems</p>
<p>116<br>00:05:02,319 –&gt; 00:05:04,839<br>they’re used in the traditional telephone network.</p>
<p>117<br>00:05:04,839 –&gt; 00:05:07,039<br>And that’s where tools like SIP start</p>
<p>118<br>00:05:07,039 –&gt; 00:05:07,879<br>get to come into play.</p>
<p>119<br>00:05:07,879 –&gt; 00:05:10,919<br>So a lot of my early work on the session initiation</p>
<p>120<br>00:05:10,920 –&gt; 00:05:13,720<br>protocol was on to left your replacement,</p>
<p>121<br>00:05:13,720 –&gt; 00:05:17,800<br>was on how you would be able to not touch</p>
<p>122<br>00:05:17,800 –&gt; 00:05:19,000<br>that traditional network.</p>
<p>123<br>00:05:19,000 –&gt; 00:05:21,160<br>But instead do all of this over the internet</p>
<p>124<br>00:05:21,160 –&gt; 00:05:23,520<br>to be able to set up calls at the end.</p>
<p>125<br>00:05:23,520 –&gt; 00:05:27,680<br>And this started to be an important dimension</p>
<p>126<br>00:05:27,680 –&gt; 00:05:30,080<br>of adopting voice and right-of-peer protocol.</p>
<p>127<br>00:05:30,080 –&gt; 00:05:33,160<br>It’s one thing to build a tool that lets you talk to anybody else</p>
<p>128<br>00:05:33,160 –&gt; 00:05:34,840<br>who happened to have a good computer, right?</p>
<p>129<br>00:05:34,840 –&gt; 00:05:38,080<br>In the 1990s and similar technology that you had.</p>
<p>130<br>00:05:38,080 –&gt; 00:05:40,720<br>But very different manner to be able to call someone</p>
<p>131<br>00:05:40,720 –&gt; 00:05:42,120<br>who’s actually on the telephone network</p>
<p>132<br>00:05:42,120 –&gt; 00:05:43,600<br>with a real telephone number.</p>
<p>133<br>00:05:43,600 –&gt; 00:05:45,760<br>And these soft switches became bridges</p>
<p>134<br>00:05:45,760 –&gt; 00:05:47,320<br>between the traditional telephone network</p>
<p>135<br>00:05:47,320 –&gt; 00:05:49,320<br>and people in the voice-spray-piece space.</p>
<p>136<br>00:05:49,320 –&gt; 00:05:51,920<br>That these have been essential going forward.</p>
<p>137<br>00:05:51,920 –&gt; 00:05:55,120<br>How voice-spray-piece becomes successful to the ability</p>
<p>138<br>00:05:55,120 –&gt; 00:05:59,960<br>for programs like St. Skype today to call out from your PC</p>
<p>139<br>00:05:59,960 –&gt; 00:06:03,520<br>to someone who has a normal landline platform.</p>
<p>140<br>00:06:03,520 –&gt; 00:06:05,600<br>Also, one of the things that you worked on</p>
<p>141<br>00:06:05,600 –&gt; 00:06:08,160<br>into the more refined versions of SIP</p>
<p>142<br>00:06:08,160 –&gt; 00:06:09,640<br>was its security model.</p>
<p>143<br>00:06:09,639 –&gt; 00:06:13,479<br>How do you actually secure the SIP one protocol?</p>
<p>144<br>00:06:13,479 –&gt; 00:06:17,120<br>So as I’m sure you can imagine, given some of the recent events</p>
<p>145<br>00:06:17,120 –&gt; 00:06:21,719<br>in the internet with respect to SIP Snowden releases.</p>
<p>146<br>00:06:21,719 –&gt; 00:06:22,719<br>This is sort of an interesting question.</p>
<p>147<br>00:06:22,719 –&gt; 00:06:26,560<br>What does DCCM something about the implications</p>
<p>148<br>00:06:26,560 –&gt; 00:06:30,919<br>of stuff like SIP and security with respect to then PSTN,</p>
<p>149<br>00:06:30,919 –&gt; 00:06:33,279<br>like wire topping laws, all those kinds of questions?</p>
<p>150<br>00:06:33,279 –&gt; 00:06:35,959<br>If where do you think this is going or how is it different?</p>
<p>151<br>00:06:35,959 –&gt; 00:06:37,519<br>Well, big question.</p>
<p>152<br>00:06:37,519 –&gt; 00:06:38,240<br>Yes.</p>
<p>153<br>00:06:38,240 –&gt; 00:06:41,160<br>I do recall when we were building the DRFC for SIP Bob</p>
<p>154<br>00:06:41,160 –&gt; 00:06:44,280<br>or SIP 3261, we basically kind of drew straws</p>
<p>155<br>00:06:44,280 –&gt; 00:06:46,199<br>for who’s going to do what parts.</p>
<p>156<br>00:06:46,199 –&gt; 00:06:49,360<br>I got to write the overview of how SIP operated</p>
<p>157<br>00:06:49,360 –&gt; 00:06:53,439<br>the one paragraph state that I got to do addressing.</p>
<p>158<br>00:06:53,439 –&gt; 00:06:55,600<br>I got to do user agent behavior.</p>
<p>159<br>00:06:55,600 –&gt; 00:06:57,879<br>And then I drew the straw to do security.</p>
<p>160<br>00:06:57,879 –&gt; 00:06:58,720<br>That’s the problem.</p>
<p>161<br>00:06:58,720 –&gt; 00:07:00,600<br>OK, I have a bit of a security background.</p>
<p>162<br>00:07:00,600 –&gt; 00:07:02,000<br>I just should be too difficult.</p>
<p>163<br>00:07:02,000 –&gt; 00:07:05,639<br>And the initial plan, one section on security and SIP,</p>
<p>164<br>00:07:05,639 –&gt; 00:07:07,639<br>actually end up being four chapters.</p>
<p>165<br>00:07:08,120 –&gt; 00:07:08,719<br>The DRC.</p>
<p>166<br>00:07:08,719 –&gt; 00:07:10,240<br>And at the time, it was with the largest DRC</p>
<p>167<br>00:07:10,240 –&gt; 00:07:15,199<br>I’ve published, accepted to not come out then.</p>
<p>168<br>00:07:15,199 –&gt; 00:07:19,039<br>And SIP security has always been a problem, tribal.</p>
<p>169<br>00:07:19,039 –&gt; 00:07:23,719<br>And these revelations obviously</p>
<p>170<br>00:07:23,719 –&gt; 00:07:26,439<br>have put the IT app and people who develop standards</p>
<p>171<br>00:07:26,439 –&gt; 00:07:29,719<br>in very interesting position.</p>
<p>172<br>00:07:29,719 –&gt; 00:07:32,279<br>No less authority than Bruce Schneier, who I would say,</p>
<p>173<br>00:07:32,279 –&gt; 00:07:35,360<br>is one of the greatest minds thinking today about security</p>
<p>174<br>00:07:35,360 –&gt; 00:07:39,319<br>has formally called on the IT app to drop what it’s doing</p>
<p>175<br>00:07:39,319 –&gt; 00:07:41,280<br>and to refocus all of its efforts</p>
<p>176<br>00:07:41,280 –&gt; 00:07:43,840<br>and are upcoming meeting with the NB Vancouver,</p>
<p>177<br>00:07:43,840 –&gt; 00:07:47,520<br>this November, on how we’re going to resolve the problems</p>
<p>178<br>00:07:47,520 –&gt; 00:07:50,360<br>that have been raised by Prism.</p>
<p>179<br>00:07:50,360 –&gt; 00:07:55,120<br>And we’ve studied the privacy properties</p>
<p>180<br>00:07:55,120 –&gt; 00:07:57,240<br>of these protocols, the security properties</p>
<p>181<br>00:07:57,240 –&gt; 00:07:59,000<br>of these protocols very extensively.</p>
<p>182<br>00:07:59,920 –&gt; 00:08:05,199<br>I’m as convinced now, I think, as I ever was,</p>
<p>183<br>00:08:05,199 –&gt; 00:08:09,480<br>that we made a lot of compromises in the design of SIP security</p>
<p>184<br>00:08:09,480 –&gt; 00:08:15,000<br>because they were necessary for it to be adopted in the marketplace.</p>
<p>185<br>00:08:15,000 –&gt; 00:08:17,720<br>It would be great to be able to design a protocol that had</p>
<p>186<br>00:08:17,720 –&gt; 00:08:21,560<br>and then security that can guarantee integrity and confidentiality</p>
<p>187<br>00:08:21,560 –&gt; 00:08:23,600<br>between one point is trying to make a call,</p>
<p>188<br>00:08:23,600 –&gt; 00:08:25,759<br>another endpoint that’s trying to make a call.</p>
<p>189<br>00:08:25,800 –&gt; 00:08:28,920<br>As soon as intermediaries are playing some role</p>
<p>190<br>00:08:28,920 –&gt; 00:08:31,800<br>in the delivery of that, as soon as they need to help you</p>
<p>191<br>00:08:31,800 –&gt; 00:08:33,720<br>to find the right endpoint.</p>
<p>192<br>00:08:33,720 –&gt; 00:08:38,720<br>And this dynamic capability that SIP has to allow,</p>
<p>193<br>00:08:39,360 –&gt; 00:08:42,319<br>if I wanted to have five devices that would all register</p>
<p>194<br>00:08:42,319 –&gt; 00:08:44,759<br>under my Sydney, my desk phone,</p>
<p>195<br>00:08:44,759 –&gt; 00:08:48,919<br>a cell phone, my iPad, various other devices,</p>
<p>196<br>00:08:48,919 –&gt; 00:08:52,240<br>they only register to some server that isn’t in network somewhere</p>
<p>197<br>00:08:52,240 –&gt; 00:08:54,559<br>that’s going to be responsible for routing traffic to it.</p>
<p>198<br>00:08:54,559 –&gt; 00:08:58,639<br>The degree to which that server has access to signaling</p>
<p>199<br>00:08:58,639 –&gt; 00:09:01,199<br>has access to who’s calling main.</p>
<p>200<br>00:09:02,199 –&gt; 00:09:04,439<br>What are the media streams that are going to be set up</p>
<p>201<br>00:09:04,439 –&gt; 00:09:07,919<br>and what are the IP endpoints that media is going to be sent</p>
<p>202<br>00:09:07,919 –&gt; 00:09:08,759<br>between?</p>
<p>203<br>00:09:10,439 –&gt; 00:09:15,439<br>We could have done more to protect that going design SIP.</p>
<p>204<br>00:09:15,439 –&gt; 00:09:20,000<br>And I think if we had, we wouldn’t be talking about SIP right now</p>
<p>205<br>00:09:20,000 –&gt; 00:09:21,679<br>because it wouldn’t have succeeded enough</p>
<p>206<br>00:09:21,679 –&gt; 00:09:23,559<br>for it to even be known for a thing.</p>
<p>207<br>00:09:23,559 –&gt; 00:09:25,399<br>Also, where is something we can talk a little bit about?</p>
<p>208<br>00:09:25,399 –&gt; 00:09:28,519<br>So SIP might be a protocol that most people don’t realize</p>
<p>209<br>00:09:28,519 –&gt; 00:09:30,159<br>they’re using or where it’s getting used.</p>
<p>210<br>00:09:30,159 –&gt; 00:09:32,000<br>Wanna talk a little bit about where it’s been successful</p>
<p>211<br>00:09:32,000 –&gt; 00:09:33,279<br>and where it’s been related?</p>
<p>212<br>00:09:33,279 –&gt; 00:09:34,279<br>Sure.</p>
<p>213<br>00:09:34,279 –&gt; 00:09:35,279<br>So I mentioned Skype.</p>
<p>214<br>00:09:35,279 –&gt; 00:09:37,839<br>If you do Skype Interstugged Out typically,</p>
<p>215<br>00:09:37,839 –&gt; 00:09:40,399<br>that is Skype’s internal protocols converted</p>
<p>216<br>00:09:40,399 –&gt; 00:09:44,239<br>for, converted into SIP for transfer to a gateway,</p>
<p>217<br>00:09:44,239 –&gt; 00:09:47,039<br>which would then go to the telephone network.</p>
<p>218<br>00:09:48,359 –&gt; 00:09:52,319<br>Basically, if you use a voice-by-p service</p>
<p>219<br>00:09:52,320 –&gt; 00:09:56,560<br>or a landline in your house that comes from either FIOs</p>
<p>220<br>00:09:56,560 –&gt; 00:09:58,800<br>or from a cable provider, that’s surely</p>
<p>221<br>00:09:58,800 –&gt; 00:10:01,120<br>set that has been used in the background.</p>
<p>222<br>00:10:01,120 –&gt; 00:10:05,400<br>The third generation cell phones, things that are 3G-PK-based,</p>
<p>223<br>00:10:05,400 –&gt; 00:10:07,840<br>all use SIP Syncaling inside them.</p>
<p>224<br>00:10:07,840 –&gt; 00:10:09,920<br>Now, I mean, these networks, especially</p>
<p>225<br>00:10:09,920 –&gt; 00:10:13,400<br>when we talk about mobile phones and about the network</p>
<p>226<br>00:10:13,400 –&gt; 00:10:15,960<br>tree seeding and the cable NSOs and so on,</p>
<p>227<br>00:10:15,960 –&gt; 00:10:19,960<br>they use a version of SIP that is relatively architecturally</p>
<p>228<br>00:10:19,960 –&gt; 00:10:21,280<br>similar to the telephone network.</p>
<p>229<br>00:10:21,279 –&gt; 00:10:24,799<br>They apply the protocol machinery of SIP</p>
<p>230<br>00:10:24,799 –&gt; 00:10:27,120<br>to generating a system that has many of the same properties</p>
<p>231<br>00:10:27,120 –&gt; 00:10:29,079<br>that the telephone network has.</p>
<p>232<br>00:10:29,079 –&gt; 00:10:31,839<br>And this too is, it’s a fundamental tree</p>
<p>233<br>00:10:31,839 –&gt; 00:10:33,000<br>off as I have these things.</p>
<p>234<br>00:10:33,000 –&gt; 00:10:38,919<br>So I would love to see a SIP that was much less dependent</p>
<p>235<br>00:10:38,919 –&gt; 00:10:43,319<br>on the network elements shaping traffic and deciding</p>
<p>236<br>00:10:43,319 –&gt; 00:10:46,759<br>how it was much more driven by the endpoints.</p>
<p>237<br>00:10:46,759 –&gt; 00:10:49,480<br>This is just kind of fundamental and then principle</p>
<p>238<br>00:10:49,480 –&gt; 00:10:50,959<br>of the internet that you want to have</p>
<p>239<br>00:10:50,960 –&gt; 00:10:52,600<br>the smarts be on the endpoints.</p>
<p>240<br>00:10:52,600 –&gt; 00:10:54,920<br>You don’t want to have an intermediary in the middle</p>
<p>241<br>00:10:54,920 –&gt; 00:10:57,400<br>of me to understand what endpoints wanted to.</p>
<p>242<br>00:10:57,400 –&gt; 00:10:59,160<br>It shouldn’t get in their way.</p>
<p>243<br>00:10:59,160 –&gt; 00:11:01,280<br>It shouldn’t prevent them from negotiating.</p>
<p>244<br>00:11:01,280 –&gt; 00:11:03,120<br>If I made up a great new code act tomorrow,</p>
<p>245<br>00:11:03,120 –&gt; 00:11:05,360<br>and I have a copy of it, and you have a copy of it,</p>
<p>246<br>00:11:05,360 –&gt; 00:11:07,360<br>but since it’s our G-wishings, I don’t love that thing</p>
<p>247<br>00:11:07,360 –&gt; 00:11:08,200<br>in the middle of the network.</p>
<p>248<br>00:11:08,200 –&gt; 00:11:10,400<br>I have to know anything about that code act</p>
<p>249<br>00:11:10,400 –&gt; 00:11:13,840<br>until I have to connect and to use it.</p>
<p>250<br>00:11:13,840 –&gt; 00:11:16,280<br>The reality is, though, of how these things actually</p>
<p>251<br>00:11:16,280 –&gt; 00:11:18,400<br>get implemented, especially when you’re doing something</p>
<p>252<br>00:11:18,399 –&gt; 00:11:20,879<br>that’s complex as replacing the telephone network,</p>
<p>253<br>00:11:20,879 –&gt; 00:11:24,240<br>replacing a more than a century old system</p>
<p>254<br>00:11:24,240 –&gt; 00:11:26,439<br>with its reliability constraints,</p>
<p>255<br>00:11:26,439 –&gt; 00:11:29,120<br>with its emergency services implications,</p>
<p>256<br>00:11:29,120 –&gt; 00:11:31,559<br>the ability to call 911.</p>
<p>257<br>00:11:31,559 –&gt; 00:11:34,799<br>Just getting the basic services people associate</p>
<p>258<br>00:11:34,799 –&gt; 00:11:39,039<br>with this right, it requires you to make compromises.</p>
<p>259<br>00:11:39,039 –&gt; 00:11:42,759<br>And I can’t say I’m always proud and retrospective</p>
<p>260<br>00:11:42,759 –&gt; 00:11:44,639<br>to compromises we needed to make in order</p>
<p>261<br>00:11:44,639 –&gt; 00:11:47,720<br>for this to be successful, but I do acknowledge</p>
<p>262<br>00:11:47,720 –&gt; 00:11:50,440<br>and retrospect that if we had pushed back</p>
<p>263<br>00:11:50,440 –&gt; 00:11:53,240<br>on some of those compromises, it certainly would have led</p>
<p>264<br>00:11:53,240 –&gt; 00:11:55,040<br>to the death of a protocol.</p>
<p>265<br>00:11:55,040 –&gt; 00:11:57,440<br>And then as people who design standards,</p>
<p>266<br>00:11:57,440 –&gt; 00:12:00,279<br>this is a heartbreaking thing that you come out against</p>
<p>267<br>00:12:00,279 –&gt; 00:12:01,279<br>again and again.</p>
<p>268<br>00:12:01,279 –&gt; 00:12:03,600<br>Now, we can be smarter about this.</p>
<p>269<br>00:12:03,600 –&gt; 00:12:07,800<br>And I think if there’s a silver lining</p>
<p>270<br>00:12:07,800 –&gt; 00:12:11,040<br>to these increasingly disturbing revelations,</p>
<p>271<br>00:12:11,040 –&gt; 00:12:14,480<br>they’re coming up about widespread state surveillance</p>
<p>272<br>00:12:14,480 –&gt; 00:12:17,399<br>of the internet, it may create a political will</p>
<p>273<br>00:12:17,399 –&gt; 00:12:21,120<br>to see a change in what we can get consensus for.</p>
<p>274<br>00:12:21,120 –&gt; 00:12:25,159<br>And hopefully, and what people will be willing to deploy.</p>
<p>275<br>00:12:25,159 –&gt; 00:12:28,399<br>I believe when you go to the ITX, since it is consensus-based,</p>
<p>276<br>00:12:28,399 –&gt; 00:12:30,799<br>there are things we could get consensus to do</p>
<p>277<br>00:12:30,799 –&gt; 00:12:32,639<br>that I think would be very radical at this point,</p>
<p>278<br>00:12:32,639 –&gt; 00:12:34,879<br>because the people who go to the ITF are still well informed,</p>
<p>279<br>00:12:34,879 –&gt; 00:12:36,919<br>they’re so energized, they’re so interested</p>
<p>280<br>00:12:36,919 –&gt; 00:12:39,439<br>in individual liberties.</p>
<p>281<br>00:12:39,439 –&gt; 00:12:41,199<br>I would hate to see the ITF though,</p>
<p>282<br>00:12:41,199 –&gt; 00:12:43,759<br>become an organization that is developing standards</p>
<p>283<br>00:12:43,759 –&gt; 00:12:46,039<br>that never seem a lighted day because it</p>
<p>284<br>00:12:46,039 –&gt; 00:12:48,079<br>is one, two-flaw in this direction.</p>
<p>285<br>00:12:48,079 –&gt; 00:12:51,279<br>And so it’s very difficult for us to understand</p>
<p>286<br>00:12:51,279 –&gt; 00:12:54,439<br>what the right course is for us to chart this point.</p>
<p>287<br>00:12:54,439 –&gt; 00:12:55,199<br>Interesting.</p>
<p>288<br>00:12:55,199 –&gt; 00:12:56,199<br>Interesting.</p>
<p>289<br>00:12:56,199 –&gt; 00:12:58,399<br>Well, I’d like to wind back a little bit.</p>
<p>290<br>00:12:58,399 –&gt; 00:13:01,000<br>Where you mentioned about how building, sort of,</p>
<p>291<br>00:13:01,000 –&gt; 00:13:03,279<br>the first soft switch where devices and all the logic</p>
<p>292<br>00:13:03,279 –&gt; 00:13:07,159<br>is in the digital first computer, at that point,</p>
<p>293<br>00:13:07,159 –&gt; 00:13:08,799<br>pretty hardens from the sun box.</p>
<p>294<br>00:13:08,799 –&gt; 00:13:11,639<br>But do you see a parallel between that</p>
<p>295<br>00:13:11,639 –&gt; 00:13:13,599<br>and then softer to find networking today,</p>
<p>296<br>00:13:13,600 –&gt; 00:13:17,000<br>or do you see that transition may be happening in the internet?</p>
<p>297<br>00:13:17,000 –&gt; 00:13:18,120<br>Is there also some of them that</p>
<p>298<br>00:13:18,120 –&gt; 00:13:20,159<br>would occur in behind this, yeah?</p>
<p>299<br>00:13:20,159 –&gt; 00:13:22,240<br>I mean, I certainly see many parallels there.</p>
<p>300<br>00:13:22,240 –&gt; 00:13:24,840<br>I’m not sure those parallels will play out</p>
<p>301<br>00:13:24,840 –&gt; 00:13:27,560<br>in exactly the same way, because the companies like Cisco</p>
<p>302<br>00:13:27,560 –&gt; 00:13:31,200<br>and Juniper that would stand to be disrupted by this,</p>
<p>303<br>00:13:31,200 –&gt; 00:13:35,480<br>the way that say, Rochelle and Lucent were in the 90s,</p>
<p>304<br>00:13:35,480 –&gt; 00:13:37,040<br>they are more agile companies.</p>
<p>305<br>00:13:37,040 –&gt; 00:13:39,960<br>They are companies that are taking these technologies</p>
<p>306<br>00:13:39,960 –&gt; 00:13:41,440<br>and trying to figure out</p>
<p>307<br>00:13:42,440 –&gt; 00:13:45,400<br>a middle path, I guess.</p>
<p>308<br>00:13:45,400 –&gt; 00:13:47,800<br>For example, there is the I2RS, the interface</p>
<p>309<br>00:13:47,800 –&gt; 00:13:49,200<br>to the routing system,</p>
<p>310<br>00:13:49,200 –&gt; 00:13:51,200<br>standard proposal circulating in the ITF.</p>
<p>311<br>00:13:51,200 –&gt; 00:13:55,440<br>Now, it’s a bit different than the very low layer software</p>
<p>312<br>00:13:55,440 –&gt; 00:13:57,320<br>to find that approach that we see,</p>
<p>313<br>00:13:57,320 –&gt; 00:13:59,360<br>saying on the other networking foundation,</p>
<p>314<br>00:13:59,360 –&gt; 00:14:03,440<br>but it’s nonetheless a way that software can interact</p>
<p>315<br>00:14:03,440 –&gt; 00:14:05,920<br>with the fit and with help, you know,</p>
<p>316<br>00:14:05,920 –&gt; 00:14:08,200<br>higher level routing decisions get made.</p>
<p>317<br>00:14:08,200 –&gt; 00:14:13,200<br>And, you know, I think the routing vendors view this</p>
<p>318<br>00:14:13,200 –&gt; 00:14:17,120<br>as one tool among many that will help decide how</p>
<p>319<br>00:14:17,120 –&gt; 00:14:18,840<br>packets are going to be forwarded.</p>
<p>320<br>00:14:18,840 –&gt; 00:14:20,240<br>They’re figuring out ways, in other words,</p>
<p>321<br>00:14:20,240 –&gt; 00:14:24,320<br>to subsune this that will allow their device</p>
<p>322<br>00:14:24,320 –&gt; 00:14:26,320<br>to take advantage of the strengths of this</p>
<p>323<br>00:14:26,320 –&gt; 00:14:29,759<br>without necessarily eroding the market control in it.</p>
<p>324<br>00:14:29,759 –&gt; 00:14:32,200<br>And they’ll lengthy install base they have,</p>
<p>325<br>00:14:32,200 –&gt; 00:14:35,080<br>love maintenance tools and so on,</p>
<p>326<br>00:14:35,080 –&gt; 00:14:37,840<br>that have proven so successful through that internet</p>
<p>327<br>00:14:37,840 –&gt; 00:14:38,680<br>in the past.</p>
<p>328<br>00:14:39,520 –&gt; 00:14:44,520<br>I don’t know that core routers have to the degree</p>
<p>329<br>00:14:44,600 –&gt; 00:14:47,120<br>that old telephone switches did,</p>
<p>330<br>00:14:47,120 –&gt; 00:14:49,840<br>impeded innovation in the network as well.</p>
<p>331<br>00:14:49,840 –&gt; 00:14:53,320<br>And that was another real driver for doing soft switching</p>
<p>332<br>00:14:53,320 –&gt; 00:14:57,759<br>was that these traditional telephone switches</p>
<p>333<br>00:14:57,759 –&gt; 00:15:00,560<br>were so model that they had no programmability.</p>
<p>334<br>00:15:00,560 –&gt; 00:15:03,440<br>There were no realistic interfaces that you could use</p>
<p>335<br>00:15:03,440 –&gt; 00:15:07,960<br>to alter their behavior without doing open-heart surgery.</p>
<p>336<br>00:15:10,480 –&gt; 00:15:11,720<br>I think situation is very different,</p>
<p>337<br>00:15:11,720 –&gt; 00:15:14,360<br>I think for core routers, but the parallels,</p>
<p>338<br>00:15:14,360 –&gt; 00:15:15,920<br>I mean, they do stand.</p>
<p>339<br>00:15:15,920 –&gt; 00:15:17,640<br>I certainly wouldn’t dismiss it on a hand.</p>
<p>340<br>00:15:17,640 –&gt; 00:15:21,360<br>And I certainly know people who work for major router vendors</p>
<p>341<br>00:15:21,360 –&gt; 00:15:23,560<br>who you find them at the bar at the right hour</p>
<p>342<br>00:15:23,560 –&gt; 00:15:25,240<br>will cry on your shoulder,</p>
<p>343<br>00:15:25,240 –&gt; 00:15:27,800<br>not exactly, you know, their concerns about this.</p>
<p>344<br>00:15:27,800 –&gt; 00:15:30,400<br>It is a real challenge for that business.</p>
<p>345<br>00:15:31,399 –&gt; 00:15:34,959<br>Well, so if you were to look at all the different pieces of work,</p>
<p>346<br>00:15:34,959 –&gt; 00:15:37,519<br>and so how many working groups are in the ATF today?</p>
<p>347<br>00:15:37,519 –&gt; 00:15:40,319<br>I’ll top my head, I’m not sure I could say.</p>
<p>348<br>00:15:40,319 –&gt; 00:15:42,519<br>Or the order 100, yeah.</p>
<p>349<br>00:15:42,519 –&gt; 00:15:45,559<br>Well, so if you were to think,</p>
<p>350<br>00:15:45,559 –&gt; 00:15:47,759<br>what’s the sort of suggest to somebody,</p>
<p>351<br>00:15:47,759 –&gt; 00:15:50,279<br>hey, this is maybe something you should keep your eye on</p>
<p>352<br>00:15:50,279 –&gt; 00:15:52,039<br>is what I think is some of the most interesting work</p>
<p>353<br>00:15:52,039 –&gt; 00:15:53,039<br>going on in the internet.</p>
<p>354<br>00:15:53,039 –&gt; 00:15:55,840<br>So stuff which is currently in progress</p>
<p>355<br>00:15:55,840 –&gt; 00:15:59,279<br>and might really significantly change what the network’s like</p>
<p>356<br>00:16:00,120 –&gt; 00:16:01,120<br>in three or three years.</p>
<p>357<br>00:16:01,120 –&gt; 00:16:03,120<br>Where would you suggest looking?</p>
<p>358<br>00:16:03,120 –&gt; 00:16:05,839<br>Not good luck to that ITU, our S group would be</p>
<p>359<br>00:16:05,839 –&gt; 00:16:08,759<br>a very significant one that I’ve been to right now.</p>
<p>360<br>00:16:08,759 –&gt; 00:16:11,120<br>There is a new effort that’s just been spun off.</p>
<p>361<br>00:16:11,120 –&gt; 00:16:14,279<br>It’s unclear if it’s going to be a working group or not.</p>
<p>362<br>00:16:14,279 –&gt; 00:16:18,240<br>It’s called Purpass, which is the ITF’s forum</p>
<p>363<br>00:16:18,240 –&gt; 00:16:19,480<br>for discussing prism.</p>
<p>364<br>00:16:19,480 –&gt; 00:16:21,639<br>And for discussing how the security things</p>
<p>365<br>00:16:21,639 –&gt; 00:16:22,600<br>are going to be addressed,</p>
<p>366<br>00:16:22,600 –&gt; 00:16:25,079<br>there are already some proposals that are circulating there</p>
<p>367<br>00:16:25,079 –&gt; 00:16:27,839<br>that are really about structural changes</p>
<p>368<br>00:16:27,840 –&gt; 00:16:30,360<br>to how the ITF process would work.</p>
<p>369<br>00:16:30,360 –&gt; 00:16:34,200<br>For should standards have to be the new bar basically</p>
<p>370<br>00:16:34,200 –&gt; 00:16:38,960<br>in order to obviate the very real concerns</p>
<p>371<br>00:16:38,960 –&gt; 00:16:41,920<br>that are increasingly coming to light about all of this.</p>
<p>372<br>00:16:41,920 –&gt; 00:16:43,840<br>If you were coming to Vancouver this time,</p>
<p>373<br>00:16:43,840 –&gt; 00:16:45,800<br>these are two things I certainly come to.</p>
<p>374<br>00:16:46,840 –&gt; 00:16:49,160<br>There are things I personally happy to be working on.</p>
<p>375<br>00:16:49,160 –&gt; 00:16:51,200<br>I think they’re very interesting and impactful</p>
<p>376<br>00:16:51,200 –&gt; 00:16:54,680<br>that might not essentially exactly that level,</p>
<p>377<br>00:16:54,679 –&gt; 00:16:59,159<br>but I continue to be very interested in CDNs</p>
<p>378<br>00:16:59,159 –&gt; 00:17:01,679<br>and the degree of internet traffic that is now being</p>
<p>379<br>00:17:01,679 –&gt; 00:17:05,279<br>directed by content distribution networks.</p>
<p>380<br>00:17:05,279 –&gt; 00:17:08,119<br>We’re doing a lot of work today on interfaces</p>
<p>381<br>00:17:08,119 –&gt; 00:17:12,359<br>for understanding how CDNs can express their coverage areas</p>
<p>382<br>00:17:12,359 –&gt; 00:17:17,359<br>and how CDNs can advertise services that they provide</p>
<p>383<br>00:17:17,879 –&gt; 00:17:20,559<br>in order to allow collaboration or clearing houses</p>
<p>384<br>00:17:20,559 –&gt; 00:17:24,639<br>among CDNs to make more optimal selections</p>
<p>385<br>00:17:24,640 –&gt; 00:17:26,400<br>of CDNs.</p>
<p>386<br>00:17:26,400 –&gt; 00:17:30,000<br>I think this will have potentially a tremendous impact</p>
<p>387<br>00:17:30,000 –&gt; 00:17:31,759<br>on the efficiency of internet traffic</p>
<p>388<br>00:17:31,759 –&gt; 00:17:33,520<br>or alleviate some of the bottlenecks</p>
<p>389<br>00:17:33,520 –&gt; 00:17:35,800<br>that people protect as more and more video</p>
<p>390<br>00:17:35,800 –&gt; 00:17:37,360<br>who’s onto the internet.</p>
<p>391<br>00:17:37,360 –&gt; 00:17:40,000<br>That’s a personal pet project of mine.</p>
<p>392<br>00:17:41,040 –&gt; 00:17:44,240<br>I am also still working on some things related to</p>
<p>393<br>00:17:44,240 –&gt; 00:17:46,000<br>the intersection of the telephone network</p>
<p>394<br>00:17:46,000 –&gt; 00:17:48,040<br>and the internet.</p>
<p>395<br>00:17:48,880 –&gt; 00:17:51,800<br>One thing that’s been, I think a major issue</p>
<p>396<br>00:17:52,759 –&gt; 00:17:56,759<br>in global calling has become an increasing problem</p>
<p>397<br>00:17:56,759 –&gt; 00:17:59,000<br>as the internet and the telephone network</p>
<p>398<br>00:17:59,000 –&gt; 00:18:01,000<br>have become more interconnected.</p>
<p>399<br>00:18:01,000 –&gt; 00:18:06,039<br>And right now I’m looking at ways that perhaps we can do</p>
<p>400<br>00:18:06,039 –&gt; 00:18:07,599<br>better identity services.</p>
<p>401<br>00:18:07,599 –&gt; 00:18:09,559<br>So it’s harder to spoof calls.</p>
<p>402<br>00:18:09,559 –&gt; 00:18:11,759<br>It’s easier to find out who’s responsible</p>
<p>403<br>00:18:11,759 –&gt; 00:18:13,960<br>for a telephone call coming off the internet</p>
<p>404<br>00:18:13,960 –&gt; 00:18:15,639<br>before it hits the PSTN.</p>
<p>405<br>00:18:15,639 –&gt; 00:18:18,799<br>As the numbers for this are just going up and up and up</p>
<p>406<br>00:18:18,799 –&gt; 00:18:21,480<br>and the FTC and the FTC are profoundly interested</p>
<p>407<br>00:18:21,480 –&gt; 00:18:22,799<br>in finding a solution for this.</p>
<p>408<br>00:18:22,799 –&gt; 00:18:24,480<br>This is worth it is being discussed</p>
<p>409<br>00:18:24,480 –&gt; 00:18:26,079<br>in congressional subcommittees already</p>
<p>410<br>00:18:26,079 –&gt; 00:18:28,480<br>as it’s going on in the ITF.</p>
<p>411<br>00:18:28,480 –&gt; 00:18:30,079<br>So that’s another place where I think we can really</p>
<p>412<br>00:18:30,079 –&gt; 00:18:31,279<br>make a difference.</p>
<p>413<br>00:18:31,279 –&gt; 00:18:33,079<br>And something that is hurting consumers</p>
<p>414<br>00:18:33,079 –&gt; 00:18:36,480<br>and we’ll be a big deal going forward.</p>
<p>415<br>00:18:36,480 –&gt; 00:18:37,839<br>So if we stop pursuing real close</p>
<p>416<br>00:18:37,839 –&gt; 00:18:39,240<br>then we have you to thank.</p>
<p>417<br>00:18:39,240 –&gt; 00:18:41,079<br>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>418<br>00:18:41,079 –&gt; 00:18:42,480<br>Great, well thanks for going by.</p>
<p>419<br>00:18:42,480 –&gt; 00:18:43,680<br>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>420<br>00:18:43,680 –&gt; 00:18:44,879<br>No much pleasure.</p>
<p>421<br>00:18:44,879 –&gt; 00:18:46,159<br>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>422<br>00:18:47,119 –&gt; 00:18:47,960<br>Bye.</p>
