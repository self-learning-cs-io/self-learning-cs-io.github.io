                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,200<br>Hi, so I’m here with Kevin Fall at the Computer Science Conference at the symposium on Operating</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,200 –&gt; 00:00:10,200<br>Systems Principles.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,200 –&gt; 00:00:14,720<br>I was really lucky to run into him here, and so I thought that actually hearing a bit about</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,720 –&gt; 00:00:19,400<br>he has to say about the internet would be interesting.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,400 –&gt; 00:00:23,199<br>So Kevin, you’re currently the author of TCPIP illustrated.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:23,199 –&gt; 00:00:24,800<br>So how did that happen?</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:24,800 –&gt; 00:00:29,760<br>Like what’s your relationship with TCPIP and the stuff that you’ve done in the past?</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:29,760 –&gt; 00:00:32,760<br>What’s your background with TCPIP?</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:32,760 –&gt; 00:00:41,400<br>So I guess when I was right after I graduated, and shortly after I got to Berkeley, somebody</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:41,400 –&gt; 00:00:46,920<br>demonstrated to me that I could send some packet to Europe and back to Berkeley in under a</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,920 –&gt; 00:00:51,880<br>second with a networking became sort of an interesting thing to look at.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:51,880 –&gt; 00:00:57,840<br>Fast forward a number of years, I worked on the networking implementation in Berkeley</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:57,840 –&gt; 00:00:59,840<br>in Xana Cray.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:59,840 –&gt; 00:01:00,840<br>It should grow a while.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:00,840 –&gt; 00:01:04,920<br>It got me into the little bit of the HBC community.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:04,920 –&gt; 00:01:12,280<br>But then I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab after my graduate work at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:12,280 –&gt; 00:01:16,600<br>So at UC San Diego I was doing some protocol work and some operating system work.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:16,600 –&gt; 00:01:21,920<br>But then with the networking group, that was all quite a bit in the networking side and</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:21,920 –&gt; 00:01:26,879<br>worked on network simulators and S simulator and so on.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:26,879 –&gt; 00:01:34,399<br>What happened though is I got to know this stuff pretty well and by the early 90s or sort</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:34,399 –&gt; 00:01:39,759<br>of mid 90s when the internet was becoming more widely known, people took an interest in</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:39,759 –&gt; 00:01:40,759<br>this.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:40,759 –&gt; 00:01:42,640<br>What is this TCPIP stuff?</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:42,640 –&gt; 00:01:48,519<br>And this particular book, TCPIP I’ve illustrated was the standard reference text and the volume</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:48,519 –&gt; 00:01:50,479<br>month is still quite a good book.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:50,479 –&gt; 00:01:56,039<br>I was teaching out of it, teaching sort of professionals from industries, Cisco and places</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:56,040 –&gt; 00:01:59,040<br>like that.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:59,040 –&gt; 00:02:03,880<br>And so I got to know the material quite well, but as the years went on and on and on,</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:03,880 –&gt; 00:02:08,520<br>there were things that it would be nice to be updated in that book.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:08,520 –&gt; 00:02:14,680<br>And so I’ve been at places where I’ve heard some people were approached to rewrite it.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:14,680 –&gt; 00:02:20,800<br>Other people approached the editor or author, Addison, to rewrite it.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:20,800 –&gt; 00:02:22,480<br>And for whatever reason it never happened.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:22,479 –&gt; 00:02:28,599<br>So I threw in my table of contents in the sample chapter and got the job in some seven</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:28,599 –&gt; 00:02:32,919<br>years later finished off the entire task with something that’s over a thousand pages</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:32,919 –&gt; 00:02:33,919<br>long.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:33,919 –&gt; 00:02:37,759<br>Well, so that’s an example of something that you thought sort of a change is needed to</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:37,759 –&gt; 00:02:42,079<br>be introduced, but wasn’t in the original.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:42,079 –&gt; 00:02:44,079<br>One of the major ones is security.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:44,079 –&gt; 00:02:50,759<br>So there’s I think a hundred pages of security that goes through the introduction of what</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:50,759 –&gt; 00:02:53,799<br>are the sort of basic primitives, what are the sort of things you might want to protect</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:53,799 –&gt; 00:02:54,799<br>against.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:54,799 –&gt; 00:03:00,079<br>And then all the various details of the protocols that actually does that.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:00,079 –&gt; 00:03:04,359<br>Really security, not only the cryptographic parts of security, but things like firewalls</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:04,359 –&gt; 00:03:09,439<br>and stuff really barely existed when the first work was done.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:09,439 –&gt; 00:03:13,879<br>There’s also a new chapter at the beginning as sort of the architectural underpinnings,</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:13,879 –&gt; 00:03:18,879<br>which is what was in the minds of people when they were thinking about how the design</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:18,879 –&gt; 00:03:20,879<br>decisions about this sort of stuff was made.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:20,879 –&gt; 00:03:25,879<br>Because I always found that quite interesting and being an operating systems guy originally,</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:25,879 –&gt; 00:03:32,159<br>how people came up with abstractions and how programs access those things and not quite</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:32,159 –&gt; 00:03:33,479<br>users necessarily.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:33,479 –&gt; 00:03:37,599<br>But what are the sort of architectural concerns?</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:37,599 –&gt; 00:03:42,680<br>And so I always was quite interested in papers and thoughts and sort of the architectural</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:42,680 –&gt; 00:03:43,680<br>area.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:43,680 –&gt; 00:03:48,479<br>So last night we were talking and you said that there is like a today people use the terms</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:48,479 –&gt; 00:03:53,199<br>of data ground, packet interchangeably, but those were not interchangeable terms.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:53,199 –&gt; 00:03:57,560<br>They actually meant something quite different, which now is lost in the sort of lost</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:57,560 –&gt; 00:03:58,560<br>in time.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:58,560 –&gt; 00:04:07,280<br>I think I mentioned this in that part of the book, but packets were sort of a fascinating</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:07,280 –&gt; 00:04:12,239<br>new concept that you could divide your larger messages into little parts and move them</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:12,239 –&gt; 00:04:13,919<br>around the network.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:13,919 –&gt; 00:04:18,039<br>But they were originally at least some variant were as part of virtual circuits.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:18,039 –&gt; 00:04:24,360<br>And so for example, the destination in a packet was the destination of an index in the table</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:24,360 –&gt; 00:04:25,360<br>of the next top.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:25,360 –&gt; 00:04:28,519<br>So you would sort of set up the route ahead of time.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:28,519 –&gt; 00:04:32,159<br>And then if that failed for some reason, you’d have a bunch of work to do to sort of go</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:32,159 –&gt; 00:04:35,360<br>back and there’s all the history of circuits and so on.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:35,360 –&gt; 00:04:42,079<br>But the data ground was maybe even more radical idea in which the destination, the final destination</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:42,079 –&gt; 00:04:47,439<br>was identified in the packet sort of structure, which the way I would teach out of this class</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:47,439 –&gt; 00:04:51,680<br>would say, you know, if I laid out the network in a two-dimensional space with this data</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:51,680 –&gt; 00:04:56,159<br>ground type property, I could take it and drop it from the air down onto any router and</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:56,159 –&gt; 00:04:59,919<br>it would just find its way through because the final destination is listed.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:59,919 –&gt; 00:05:03,759<br>But of course that was a trade-off because now you have more bits to you have to allocate</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:03,759 –&gt; 00:05:07,319<br>because there’s presumably a larger number of possible destinations that would be</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:07,319 –&gt; 00:05:08,319<br>maybe available.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:08,399 –&gt; 00:05:13,920<br>So these were the kind of nuances that were actually pretty neat to sort of get the details</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:13,920 –&gt; 00:05:18,319<br>from by going back in the architectural history and thinking and learning about what people</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:18,319 –&gt; 00:05:20,319<br>were sort of arguing at the time.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:20,319 –&gt; 00:05:23,439<br>Cool. So what are you working on now?</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:23,439 –&gt; 00:05:27,519<br>So like what are the most interesting things do you think in networking and the internet</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:27,519 –&gt; 00:05:31,519<br>and systems that you’re trying to tackle?</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:31,519 –&gt; 00:05:37,199<br>So there’s a couple areas that I think are fun and sort of worth mentioning.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:37,199 –&gt; 00:05:40,399<br>At least one of which we have some work on.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:40,399 –&gt; 00:05:47,360<br>The first one is just we don’t have so much work on but is the, and I mentioned you</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:47,360 –&gt; 00:05:53,839<br>lick lighter and I’d make reference to that in the book as well, but the him and some sort</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:53,839 –&gt; 00:05:57,839<br>of his colleagues and predecessors had envisioned that not only do we have a thing that</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:57,839 –&gt; 00:06:02,240<br>winds up essentially being today’s internet that there’s communication and these communities,</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:02,240 –&gt; 00:06:05,279<br>but there’s also a physical way of moving things around, which is like a global,</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:05,279 –&gt; 00:06:09,279<br>pneumatic tube system. So you could take your thing and shove it and it would find its way,</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:09,279 –&gt; 00:06:12,719<br>which would be a very cool thing to have, but I don’t think we’re quite there yet,</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:12,719 –&gt; 00:06:15,279<br>and I’m not sure where ever we’re going to really wind up at that.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:15,279 –&gt; 00:06:19,279<br>Maybe they sort of be a positive, not pneumatic, but it’s not quite pneumatic.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:19,279 –&gt; 00:06:25,679<br>But on the other hand, I think the sort of 3D printing technology as combined with what’s going on</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:25,679 –&gt; 00:06:31,119<br>with the sort of free order or easy dissemination of information becomes quite interesting,</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:31,119 –&gt; 00:06:34,479<br>especially when you can put things other than plastics and so on.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:34,480 –&gt; 00:06:38,879<br>So I had in my hand a demonstration that was a titanium 3D printed</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:39,840 –&gt; 00:06:49,920<br>nose replacement part, prosthetic nose, and it was a strands of titanium printed on top of each other.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:50,480 –&gt; 00:06:57,439<br>And if you can load up your device with the right materials, pretty much any material thing you</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:57,439 –&gt; 00:07:04,319<br>want to create almost could be created. So even into the world of sensor networks, things we’ve</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:04,480 –&gt; 00:07:08,480<br>seen people will look at, well, sensing the world, maybe even actuating the world,</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:08,480 –&gt; 00:07:12,240<br>but like building the world on demand and combination with those other things is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:12,240 –&gt; 00:07:16,319<br>And I wonder if that’s not kind of the way to get to the vision of pneumatic tubes,</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:16,319 –&gt; 00:07:18,480<br>but instead of actually moving it, you just make another one.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:18,480 –&gt; 00:07:19,280<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:19,280 –&gt; 00:07:25,439<br>And so how far in the future will it be that you just carry around in your car, your backpack,</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:25,439 –&gt; 00:07:30,720<br>or whatever, the basic system, and then you just download whatever the thing is you happen to need?</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:31,680 –&gt; 00:07:35,120<br>It even goes a little, there was literally, I think it was not a few months ago,</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:35,120 –&gt; 00:07:40,720<br>there was a meeting in Washington DC about the security implications of additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:40,720 –&gt; 00:07:42,640<br>Right, I mean, there’s all those questions about firearms.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:42,640 –&gt; 00:07:45,920<br>Yeah, like pretty on the air, the team was more chassis.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:46,800 –&gt; 00:07:52,320<br>So generally in firearms, there’s one particular piece of the gun, the one that’s strongly regulated,</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:52,320 –&gt; 00:07:54,560<br>it’s the thing that’s kind of everything has to stick on to.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:55,920 –&gt; 00:07:59,440<br>And somebody 3D printed one, it’s only something you need a license for.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:59,519 –&gt; 00:08:03,600<br>Is there this interesting question about what then the implications are going for,</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:03,600 –&gt; 00:08:05,199<br>all these kinds of things like DRM?</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:05,680 –&gt; 00:08:10,399<br>Yeah, and so what is, I think those are, there’s lots of policy questions.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:10,399 –&gt; 00:08:17,279<br>I think it’s been one, as is often the case, technology will outpace the policy ability to</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:17,279 –&gt; 00:08:22,639<br>comprehend and sort of instantiate reasonable laws about these things, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:23,199 –&gt; 00:08:29,360<br>And so this idea that bits that are become interchangeable with physical objects,</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:29,439 –&gt; 00:08:33,759<br>and we have traditionally regulated the control of physical objects, but now,</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:34,559 –&gt; 00:08:39,679<br>do we have to make sure that the team includes the creation time.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:39,679 –&gt; 00:08:41,279<br>Yeah, so, it’s ganging creations.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:41,279 –&gt; 00:08:44,559<br>It’s pretty interesting, so that’s that set of implications.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:44,559 –&gt; 00:08:50,159<br>So that’s one of the topics and actually gets into other things that you can compute with,</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:50,159 –&gt; 00:08:56,399<br>and maybe creating compute like synthetic biology, I want to create a little organism that</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:56,959 –&gt; 00:08:59,679<br>takes one thing and something comes out the other end.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:59,679 –&gt; 00:09:03,840<br>Well, if I have biologicals in my 3D printer and I can download that and have the,</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:03,840 –&gt; 00:09:10,319<br>not just download designs, but have the tools to do the designs of the biological systems.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:10,319 –&gt; 00:09:12,319<br>I think they start to start to try.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:12,319 –&gt; 00:09:16,559<br>It is very important about these implications.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:17,679 –&gt; 00:09:21,600<br>So that’s one whole category I think that when I was thinking about the</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:21,600 –&gt; 00:09:26,320<br>pneumatic tube system and then looking at 3D printing and its capabilities and now the price has</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:26,320 –&gt; 00:09:28,399<br>gone down so people can just go get them.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:28,399 –&gt; 00:09:30,159<br>This is a pretty interesting thing.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:30,159 –&gt; 00:09:30,960<br>Cool.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:30,960 –&gt; 00:09:31,360<br>Cool.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:31,360 –&gt; 00:09:33,360<br>Well, it was great chatting with you and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:33,360 –&gt; 00:09:34,560<br>Okay, and yeah, sure.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:34,560 –&gt; 00:09:35,360<br>See you next time.</p>
