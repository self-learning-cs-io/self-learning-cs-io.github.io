                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:11,000<br>So I’m here today with Reed Hunt, who is best known for being at the chairman of the FCC</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:11,000 –&gt; 00:00:17,080<br>during the Clinton administration in the mid 1990s. It was a very exciting time for development</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:17,080 –&gt; 00:00:23,039<br>of communications. There was telecommunications act. There was a huge growth of the internet</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:23,039 –&gt; 00:00:28,379<br>leading up to the internet bubble at the end of the 1990s. There was the beginnings of</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:28,379 –&gt; 00:00:33,460<br>auctions of spectrum. Reed was a time of very rapid change. So it’s a real pleasure and</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:33,460 –&gt; 00:00:40,179<br>delight to have Reed Hunt here with us today. I read how you doing. Good, good to be with</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:40,179 –&gt; 00:00:48,259<br>you Nick and good to be with your 39,000 students. So Reed has been very involved in the last</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:48,259 –&gt; 00:00:55,280<br>few months of raising the debate and asking many questions about the very controversial</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:55,280 –&gt; 00:01:01,600<br>topic of data privacy, government tapping, government eavesdropping on citizens, and all</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:01,600 –&gt; 00:01:07,359<br>of the things related to the Snowden leaks and the NSA. So it’s very relevant and very</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:07,359 –&gt; 00:01:12,319<br>timely to be able to have Reed talk with us today. So Reed, I just wanted to ask you a very</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:12,319 –&gt; 00:01:18,680<br>first to start with, really a more general question. Many of the students that are watching from</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:18,680 –&gt; 00:01:23,640<br>outside the United States and perhaps don’t know what the FCC is, the Federal Communications</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:23,640 –&gt; 00:01:28,120<br>Commission and what they do, what their responsibilities are. Can you just give us an overview of what</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:28,120 –&gt; 00:01:34,120<br>the FCC is responsible for? You bet. The Federal Communications Commission is what in the</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:34,120 –&gt; 00:01:41,280<br>United States we call an independent regulatory agency. The year five commissioners, one of</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:41,280 –&gt; 00:01:47,280<br>them is the chair. I was the chair because Bill Clinton picked me among the commissioners</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:47,280 –&gt; 00:01:56,519<br>to be a chair in 1993. It is independent of the executive branch, meaning the president</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:56,519 –&gt; 00:02:04,879<br>cannot tell the FCC what to do. It gets its powers from the legislature, but once it has</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:04,879 –&gt; 00:02:12,400<br>those powers, it regulates and the only check and balance on the regulation comes from</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:12,400 –&gt; 00:02:19,000<br>the courts because companies, individuals can challenge the regulations and say that they’re</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:19,000 –&gt; 00:02:26,159<br>illegal or they’re unconstitutional and can take the issue to the court. So the Federal Communications</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:26,159 –&gt; 00:02:33,080<br>Commission as an independent regulatory agency is quite a bit different than the regulatory</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:33,080 –&gt; 00:02:39,480<br>agencies in many, many other countries for two respect and two reasons. Number one, in many</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:39,479 –&gt; 00:02:46,919<br>other countries, the regulatory agencies do report to the executive branch. And second, in many</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:46,919 –&gt; 00:02:54,479<br>other countries, many parts of the communications industry are owned by the government in whole</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:54,479 –&gt; 00:03:02,519<br>or in part as is the case in China, as is the case in Germany, as is in the case of France and</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:02,520 –&gt; 00:03:10,320<br>other countries. So in the US, we don’t have government ownership of the information communications</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:10,320 –&gt; 00:03:16,920<br>and technology sector with a few very, very minor exceptions. There are some small towns that</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:16,920 –&gt; 00:03:23,240<br>own their own telephone companies. And we have a regulatory agency that is independent of the rest</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:23,240 –&gt; 00:03:30,520<br>of government. By far, the Federal Communications Commission is the most powerful regulatory agency</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:31,240 –&gt; 00:03:38,520<br>for the information communications and technology sector in the United States and relative to all</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:38,520 –&gt; 00:03:47,879<br>of the regulators in the world in this sector. It is by far the most powerful agency. So during the 1990s,</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:47,879 –&gt; 00:03:54,600<br>during those times of just enormous change, in every aspect of communication, long distance</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:54,599 –&gt; 00:04:01,719<br>telephone communications, deregulation of the industry and the growth of the internet, the</p>
<p>36<br>00:04:01,719 –&gt; 00:04:07,240<br>auctioning of spectrum, the changing of rules on consolidation of radio stations, of ownership of</p>
<p>37<br>00:04:07,240 –&gt; 00:04:13,560<br>radio stations. They were just massive changes. So what role did the FCC play in that? And to what</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:13,560 –&gt; 00:04:19,560<br>extent did were those changes foreseen and understood? Because they must have meant big changes to the FCC</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:19,560 –&gt; 00:04:29,240<br>itself, not only to the policy that it was advocating. So I became the FCC chairman 20 years ago</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:29,240 –&gt; 00:04:38,680<br>next month, November 1993, and approximately that was the month that the internet was invented as a</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:38,680 –&gt; 00:04:47,079<br>commercial matter. Meaning that was approximately when Marc Andrewsons Mosaic Browseur</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:49,560 –&gt; 00:04:56,040<br>was exploding across the United States and then the rest of the world. And when everyone saw that</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:56,040 –&gt; 00:05:04,920<br>the internet could be used not just for text and not just for fairly academic discourse, but rather</p>
<p>44<br>00:05:04,920 –&gt; 00:05:11,319<br>you could get to the internet by plugging in your own personal computer to the telephone network.</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:12,199 –&gt; 00:05:19,400<br>And you could download the browser and then with this browser, you could turn your own PC into a</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:19,400 –&gt; 00:05:26,520<br>website and also go to anybody else’s website and see pictures or listen to music, then all of a</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:26,520 –&gt; 00:05:32,680<br>sudden really in just the matter of weeks. Everybody in the United States and pretty soon everybody in the</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:32,680 –&gt; 00:05:43,079<br>world said, holy cow, this is going to completely transform the world. So two things were told to me</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:43,879 –&gt; 00:05:51,000<br>right away by a whole bunch of people in technology. The first was something said to me by Nicholas</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:51,000 –&gt; 00:05:58,840<br>Nicarapante who then was running MIT Media Labs. He said, you need to understand that everything in</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:58,839 –&gt; 00:06:06,439<br>communications is backwards. And I said, what do you mean? And he said, well, we use the airwaves</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:06,439 –&gt; 00:06:13,479<br>for broadcast television. We use the airwaves for video. Video is lots of data. And the airwaves,</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:13,479 –&gt; 00:06:23,319<br>as a matter of physics, are really not well suited to carry all that data. And we use lines, copper,</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:23,480 –&gt; 00:06:31,079<br>we use an underground physical network to carry voice communication. But that’s really where the data</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:31,079 –&gt; 00:06:38,279<br>ought to be, where you have lots of packets to carry because voices hardly any data. So he said,</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:38,279 –&gt; 00:06:45,800<br>your job at the FCC is to do what I call the Nicarapante switch. You need to have all voice communication</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:45,800 –&gt; 00:06:53,800<br>over the air and all data communication go in physical networks that are terrestrial. So that is a</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:53,800 –&gt; 00:07:01,080<br>big strategic change. And what he meant in the American system is not that the FCC would order that,</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:01,080 –&gt; 00:07:07,000<br>but that it would change all the regulations so that companies that wanted to execute on this great</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:07,000 –&gt; 00:07:14,280<br>switch actually could do so. So they could get spectrum for mobile communications so that they could</p>
<p>61<br>00:07:14,279 –&gt; 00:07:20,679<br>build physical networks that interconnected with existing networks so that they could write their</p>
<p>62<br>00:07:20,679 –&gt; 00:07:25,159<br>content differently so that they could have access to networks for different kinds of content.</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:25,959 –&gt; 00:07:32,039<br>In a very, very big picture way, that’s exactly what we tried to do starting in 1993.</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:32,759 –&gt; 00:07:40,279<br>And I got to tell you, the FCC was hugely successful in the American tech industry, was hugely successful.</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:40,599 –&gt; 00:07:47,719<br>And the American communications industry was also very successful in executing the biggest</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:47,719 –&gt; 00:07:56,279<br>transformation at scale of any businesses in history, meaning the entire Bell network</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:57,079 –&gt; 00:08:04,199<br>went from a fixed line voice celebrity network to an over the air mobile communications network.</p>
<p>68<br>00:08:05,079 –&gt; 00:08:12,360<br>And that represented well more than $100 billion of capital expenditure in a complete transformation</p>
<p>69<br>00:08:13,800 –&gt; 00:08:19,399<br>of every aspect of the way that they were doing business. So that was the big switch.</p>
<p>70<br>00:08:20,680 –&gt; 00:08:24,680<br>And then I told you there were two things I was told. Here was the other thing I was told.</p>
<p>71<br>00:08:24,680 –&gt; 00:08:28,039<br>And I was told this by Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel,</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:29,000 –&gt; 00:08:34,360<br>and they at the Stanford Park Hotel about 400 meters from where you’re sitting right now, Nick.</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:35,159 –&gt; 00:08:43,240<br>In the beginning of 1994, he said, you need to understand that this is a war. And I said,</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:43,240 –&gt; 00:08:51,159<br>what do you mean it’s a war? And he said, data, packet switch data is the disruptive enemy of</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:51,159 –&gt; 00:08:57,080<br>circuit switched communication. I’m going to let you make sure that you’ve taught all your students.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:57,080 –&gt; 00:09:07,400<br>Exactly. He said, you need to understand that those who depend on analog communication and</p>
<p>77<br>00:09:07,400 –&gt; 00:09:13,240<br>circuit switch technology are going to be relegated to the dustbin of history. And you need to make</p>
<p>78<br>00:09:13,240 –&gt; 00:09:19,240<br>sure the government doesn’t try to save them that the government makes the way for the winning technology.</p>
<p>79<br>00:09:19,639 –&gt; 00:09:27,639<br>So we really tried to do that. And that really, really did happen. And there were many losers as a</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:27,639 –&gt; 00:09:35,799<br>consequence. I’ll conclude by giving you the biggest example of a huge loser. By the late 1990s,</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:35,799 –&gt; 00:09:44,440<br>18T was the dominant long distance company in the United States. And the most powerful international</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:44,440 –&gt; 00:09:50,680<br>company in the communications area waving the American flag as its headquarters. More than</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:50,680 –&gt; 00:09:56,520<br>$100 billion of market cap, immensely significant in every major city in the world.</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:57,640 –&gt; 00:10:04,040<br>Within less than 10 years, its market cap was one tenth of that. And it was sold for a song to</p>
<p>85<br>00:10:04,759 –&gt; 00:10:13,879<br>SPC, which took its name as 18T. It did not execute on either the switch from circuit to packet,</p>
<p>86<br>00:10:14,759 –&gt; 00:10:25,319<br>or the move from landline to voice being mobile, or the move to a physical network scaring data</p>
<p>87<br>00:10:26,039 –&gt; 00:10:31,959<br>as their dominant motor business. It didn’t execute on any of those changes and it was a huge loser.</p>
<p>88<br>00:10:32,920 –&gt; 00:10:35,800<br>So if you look at some of the big changes that happened during that time,</p>
<p>89<br>00:10:37,800 –&gt; 00:10:41,800<br>are there some of that if you got to go back and revisit them that you would</p>
<p>90<br>00:10:43,000 –&gt; 00:10:45,240<br>that you think should have been handled a little differently?</p>
<p>91<br>00:10:48,519 –&gt; 00:10:56,519<br>In the United States, no. The information of the communications revolution</p>
<p>92<br>00:10:57,079 –&gt; 00:11:04,519<br>meant a commitment as a matter of business and as a matter of government to the notion that</p>
<p>93<br>00:11:04,519 –&gt; 00:11:11,480<br>there would be winning companies and losing companies. That was a reversal of the traditional</p>
<p>94<br>00:11:11,480 –&gt; 00:11:15,720<br>policy which was this. Nobody would win a lot and nobody would ever lose.</p>
<p>95<br>00:11:17,319 –&gt; 00:11:25,000<br>Another word stability. Another word one big company, a few companies in broadcast,</p>
<p>96<br>00:11:25,559 –&gt; 00:11:32,200<br>lots of little radio companies, one major newspaper in every city, tremendous stability,</p>
<p>97<br>00:11:32,200 –&gt; 00:11:38,360<br>very little innovation, no risk. The communications platform would be like the ground under your</p>
<p>98<br>00:11:38,360 –&gt; 00:11:46,840<br>feet. It wouldn’t ever be subject to the earthquake. It wouldn’t ever be at risk. And instead,</p>
<p>99<br>00:11:46,840 –&gt; 00:11:53,799<br>we moved to a completely different model. Tremendous upheaval, tremendous challenge for the companies</p>
<p>100<br>00:11:53,799 –&gt; 00:12:01,240<br>to change. A willingness to cope with change. And the result was that we had a fantastic economic</p>
<p>101<br>00:12:01,240 –&gt; 00:12:09,799<br>boom. So there’s really nothing about that at the big picture level that I think we should regret.</p>
<p>102<br>00:12:10,439 –&gt; 00:12:16,919<br>So one of the consequences of the big change to the internet is that that stability that we saw</p>
<p>103<br>00:12:16,919 –&gt; 00:12:21,799<br>that was holding back some of the socketswitch world now has become a stability holding back the</p>
<p>104<br>00:12:21,799 –&gt; 00:12:27,559<br>packet switch world. For example, the industry structure around an internet architecture and</p>
<p>105<br>00:12:27,559 –&gt; 00:12:34,279<br>narrow waste of IP that really has not changed very much over the last 15 or 20 years. In industry</p>
<p>106<br>00:12:34,279 –&gt; 00:12:41,399<br>structure that has favoured closed, vertically integrated equipment for which the pace of innovation</p>
<p>107<br>00:12:41,399 –&gt; 00:12:45,799<br>of the networking equipment itself has been relatively slow, particularly if we compare it to the</p>
<p>108<br>00:12:45,799 –&gt; 00:12:52,359<br>computer industry as a whole. Now there are changes of foot to break apart some of that vertical</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:54,359 –&gt; 00:13:00,599<br>vertical integration and open up interfaces and bring about a more software based</p>
<p>110<br>00:13:01,319 –&gt; 00:13:07,399<br>rate of innovation in the network infrastructure. Do you think that government and government</p>
<p>111<br>00:13:07,399 –&gt; 00:13:13,240<br>regulation has a place to in the, in a sense, the governance and driving of the internet?</p>
<p>112<br>00:13:13,320 –&gt; 00:13:23,000<br>Well, I would say yes and no. So I think you’re describing one way to talk about what you’re</p>
<p>113<br>00:13:23,000 –&gt; 00:13:30,039<br>describing is the difference between a closed and open and another way to talk about it is the</p>
<p>114<br>00:13:30,039 –&gt; 00:13:38,200<br>difference between horizontal and vertical. So what do we mean by horizontal? Well, the famous</p>
<p>115<br>00:13:38,200 –&gt; 00:13:46,920<br>writings of Andy Grove in the 1990s about the computer industry all focused on the notion that</p>
<p>116<br>00:13:46,920 –&gt; 00:13:54,920<br>the industry was horizontally organized. There would be a chip industry until would be his primary</p>
<p>117<br>00:13:54,920 –&gt; 00:14:00,759<br>example and it was indeed without question the most profitable semiconductor business that ever</p>
<p>118<br>00:14:00,759 –&gt; 00:14:07,320<br>existed. Still is the most profitable semiconductor business that has ever existed. But it did not</p>
<p>119<br>00:14:07,320 –&gt; 00:14:14,520<br>move vertical. It did not do the software that is the operating system and it didn’t do above that</p>
<p>120<br>00:14:14,520 –&gt; 00:14:21,400<br>the application layer and it’s similarly if you want to extrapolate to different services that</p>
<p>121<br>00:14:21,400 –&gt; 00:14:28,600<br>might be provided as versions of delivering on applications until wasn’t involved in that. There</p>
<p>122<br>00:14:28,600 –&gt; 00:14:34,360<br>would be different companies at each of these layers. There would be competition within the layers</p>
<p>123<br>00:14:35,159 –&gt; 00:14:41,159<br>but the layers themselves would cooperate in order to deliver the finished product. That’s the</p>
<p>124<br>00:14:41,800 –&gt; 00:14:49,000<br>horizontal non-vertical model. The great challenge to that is the apple model, right?</p>
<p>125<br>00:14:49,800 –&gt; 00:14:55,879<br>Yep, which is we’ll just do everything from the bottom to the top and it won’t be open to anybody</p>
<p>126<br>00:14:55,879 –&gt; 00:15:02,519<br>and we may get vendors to provide things but everything will be done will be done our way. If you ask</p>
<p>127<br>00:15:03,159 –&gt; 00:15:08,840<br>should the government dictate a horizontal market structure or a vertical market structure,</p>
<p>128<br>00:15:08,840 –&gt; 00:15:16,679<br>I would say government should really enjoy the battle of the different companies for</p>
<p>129<br>00:15:17,559 –&gt; 00:15:23,159<br>economic success with different models. There’s no obvious reason why government should say one</p>
<p>130<br>00:15:23,159 –&gt; 00:15:29,240<br>model is better than another model. That’s horizontal and vertical. Now let’s talk about open and closed.</p>
<p>131<br>00:15:29,960 –&gt; 00:15:36,919<br>Open and closed has at least two different meanings. One is the meaning that I think you might</p>
<p>132<br>00:15:36,919 –&gt; 00:15:44,440<br>apply to standards. For example, let’s take the Microsoft operating system.</p>
<p>133<br>00:15:45,879 –&gt; 00:15:52,919<br>Was that an open system? Well, not really. You had to get permission to design an application for it</p>
<p>134<br>00:15:52,919 –&gt; 00:15:59,159<br>and even if you got that permission it would be not open in any way like the Android system.</p>
<p>135<br>00:16:00,039 –&gt; 00:16:06,120<br>First, it wasn’t open because people would have to pay for access to it. Second, it wasn’t</p>
<p>136<br>00:16:06,120 –&gt; 00:16:14,120<br>open because it didn’t permit a community of innovators to alter it and use it in a particular</p>
<p>137<br>00:16:14,120 –&gt; 00:16:21,399<br>manner. So should government speak to that kind of open and closed? Again, I think that’s a</p>
<p>138<br>00:16:21,399 –&gt; 00:16:27,399<br>question of business model and the government ought to keep its nose out of that. But another</p>
<p>139<br>00:16:27,399 –&gt; 00:16:34,279<br>meaning of open and closed is were those words apply to what an antitrust lawyer like me would</p>
<p>140<br>00:16:34,279 –&gt; 00:16:45,399<br>call bottleneck or monopoly power. So take a look, for example, at Google’s market share in search.</p>
<p>141<br>00:16:47,000 –&gt; 00:16:52,759<br>Any government in the world would say that the 80-90% market share that Google has for search</p>
<p>142<br>00:16:52,759 –&gt; 00:17:00,840<br>represents a monopoly market share. And that search engine is not open. Meaning there’s nothing</p>
<p>143<br>00:17:00,840 –&gt; 00:17:08,359<br>more closed or carefully guarded or kept secret than Google’s algorithms for search. And nobody else</p>
<p>144<br>00:17:08,359 –&gt; 00:17:14,920<br>on the outside can get access to them and alter them in some particular way. So as to, for example,</p>
<p>145<br>00:17:14,920 –&gt; 00:17:23,240<br>optimize for searching the works of a unique or my works on the internet.</p>
<p>146<br>00:17:23,240 –&gt; 00:17:29,960<br>Great. Now, should government get involved in opening bottlenecks and the answer is sometimes.</p>
<p>147<br>00:17:30,519 –&gt; 00:17:37,480<br>When those bottlenecks represent monopoly power that is going to be used to fort innovation or</p>
<p>148<br>00:17:37,640 –&gt; 00:17:40,680<br>crush competition, that’s when government should get involved.</p>
<p>149<br>00:17:42,200 –&gt; 00:17:49,400<br>I see. So I’d like to move the conversation a little bit towards more recent events and privacy and</p>
<p>150<br>00:17:50,839 –&gt; 00:17:59,319<br>matters of security. So as far back as 1994, US Congress passed the communications assistance for</p>
<p>151<br>00:17:59,319 –&gt; 00:18:04,759<br>Law Enforcement Act or Calia, which was quite controversial at the time. But it was originally</p>
<p>152<br>00:18:04,759 –&gt; 00:18:09,640<br>put there to aid law enforcement and its efforts to conduct surveillance of digital telephone networks.</p>
<p>153<br>00:18:11,240 –&gt; 00:18:16,519<br>What was that about? And how did that affect and lay the groundwork for where we are today?</p>
<p>154<br>00:18:17,480 –&gt; 00:18:24,359<br>Okay. So just to go back in history, in that time period, approximately 20 years ago,</p>
<p>155<br>00:18:25,079 –&gt; 00:18:30,519<br>a voice communication was over these landline networks for the most part, not over cellular,</p>
<p>156<br>00:18:30,519 –&gt; 00:18:35,639<br>and certainly not over anything like the internet. It was over these circuit switch networks.</p>
<p>157<br>00:18:35,960 –&gt; 00:18:43,160<br>And since almost all voice communication was on those networks, that meant that the actual</p>
<p>158<br>00:18:43,160 –&gt; 00:18:50,680<br>communications themselves would be consolidated within the networks of just a few companies.</p>
<p>159<br>00:18:50,680 –&gt; 00:18:54,680<br>And they were all regulated by the FCC. They’re still regulated by the FCC.</p>
<p>160<br>00:18:55,480 –&gt; 00:19:04,039<br>So in that time period 20 years ago, it was physically possible to have the government,</p>
<p>161<br>00:19:04,039 –&gt; 00:19:09,000<br>either through the FCC or through some other arm of government, go to just a handful of companies</p>
<p>162<br>00:19:09,000 –&gt; 00:19:14,759<br>and say, you’re going to see all the phone calls in America and most phone calls in the world</p>
<p>163<br>00:19:14,759 –&gt; 00:19:20,759<br>are physically going to go through the United States. Even if they’re going for China to Europe,</p>
<p>164<br>00:19:20,759 –&gt; 00:19:25,480<br>they’re probably going to go through the United States. So you’re going to see almost all phone</p>
<p>165<br>00:19:25,480 –&gt; 00:19:30,759<br>calls in the world. And under certain conditions, we want to eavesdrop on those phone calls.</p>
<p>166<br>00:19:31,879 –&gt; 00:19:39,640<br>So it was very, it was physically easy. And from a regulatory perspective, it wasn’t very intrusive.</p>
<p>167<br>00:19:39,640 –&gt; 00:19:44,759<br>The only question in that time period, there were two questions. Question one would be,</p>
<p>168<br>00:19:44,839 –&gt; 00:19:49,400<br>would the government have to get a warrant from a court to get access to those calls?</p>
<p>169<br>00:19:49,960 –&gt; 00:19:55,079<br>And question two would be, well, who would pay for the eavesdropping? Because it was actually a</p>
<p>170<br>00:19:55,079 –&gt; 00:20:02,519<br>fairly complex technical matter to do that. Right. And the FBI wanted the FCC to order the phone</p>
<p>171<br>00:20:02,519 –&gt; 00:20:09,240<br>companies to pay. And I told the FBI, I’m not doing that. You can figure out how to get the phone</p>
<p>172<br>00:20:09,240 –&gt; 00:20:14,440<br>companies to pay. I have no idea how you’ll do that. But if you can’t do that, go to Congress</p>
<p>173<br>00:20:14,440 –&gt; 00:20:20,200<br>and get an appropriation and you spend the money. So it may seem a little antiquated, but the</p>
<p>174<br>00:20:20,200 –&gt; 00:20:26,600<br>primary debate was about who would get the money to do it. So moving the clock forward to today,</p>
<p>175<br>00:20:27,480 –&gt; 00:20:34,279<br>when an internet service provider or even an equipment vendor such as Cisco Juniper,</p>
<p>176<br>00:20:34,279 –&gt; 00:20:40,519<br>Alcatel-Lusent, Huawei is building equipment for use by an operator.</p>
<p>177<br>00:20:41,000 –&gt; 00:20:48,920<br>Who’s responsibility is it to create a technical ability and who pays for the ability to tap</p>
<p>178<br>00:20:48,920 –&gt; 00:20:54,039<br>internet communications? Okay. Well, first of all, as far as the who pays part is concerned,</p>
<p>179<br>00:20:54,920 –&gt; 00:21:00,839<br>the debate hasn’t changed one bit from where it was 20 years ago. So the idea of the different</p>
<p>180<br>00:21:00,839 –&gt; 00:21:06,279<br>agencies and government is, well, we don’t have any money. So you companies ought to do all the work</p>
<p>181<br>00:21:06,279 –&gt; 00:21:12,119<br>of assembling the data. And when you’ve got it all organized and when you figured out the</p>
<p>182<br>00:21:12,119 –&gt; 00:21:18,359<br>database and when you’ve used to do it to get all the unstructured data in some kind of searchable</p>
<p>183<br>00:21:18,359 –&gt; 00:21:25,160<br>form, we’ll just show up and we’ll just borrow it. We’ll just have access to it. So that’s actually</p>
<p>184<br>00:21:25,160 –&gt; 00:21:31,799<br>what all the newspaper accounts have said that the American agencies have been doing. They’ve</p>
<p>185<br>00:21:31,799 –&gt; 00:21:37,399<br>been letting the companies do all the work of gathering the data and organizing it and storing it.</p>
<p>186<br>00:21:37,399 –&gt; 00:21:42,200<br>And of course, the companies apparently want to do that for their commercial purposes. And the</p>
<p>187<br>00:21:42,200 –&gt; 00:21:48,200<br>government is saying, how about a free ride? You know, we have some national security purposes as well.</p>
<p>188<br>00:21:51,960 –&gt; 00:21:59,159<br>The thing that has changed is the government is not interested in so much anymore in just the voice</p>
<p>189<br>00:21:59,160 –&gt; 00:22:04,600<br>communications, which now are predominantly mobile. It’s interested in all this other data</p>
<p>190<br>00:22:04,600 –&gt; 00:22:11,160<br>that the over-the-top companies have learned how to gather, which is where am I and what am I saying</p>
<p>191<br>00:22:11,160 –&gt; 00:22:17,160<br>on Twitter and what am I saying in emails and what have I saved, what pictures have I taken and</p>
<p>192<br>00:22:17,160 –&gt; 00:22:22,440<br>where have I saved those pictures. In other words, what am I doing, what am I thinking? And most</p>
<p>193<br>00:22:22,440 –&gt; 00:22:30,120<br>importantly, what predictions can be made about what I’m about to do. All of that, which commercial</p>
<p>194<br>00:22:30,120 –&gt; 00:22:37,000<br>companies have perfected so that they can tell advertisers where to advertise. The government is</p>
<p>195<br>00:22:37,000 –&gt; 00:22:42,440<br>saying, if you can make those kinds of predictions, then that means you can help us make predictions about</p>
<p>196<br>00:22:42,440 –&gt; 00:22:48,120<br>who is about to commit crimes, some of them potentially really hideous.</p>
<p>197<br>00:22:48,839 –&gt; 00:22:55,879<br>So some of the, to clearly, the over-the-top companies are already collecting large amounts of data</p>
<p>198<br>00:22:55,879 –&gt; 00:23:01,319<br>just for the service that they provide. And so there are a right source for that information</p>
<p>199<br>00:23:01,319 –&gt; 00:23:07,719<br>from lower enforcement and intelligence agencies. But the network equipment, the switches and</p>
<p>200<br>00:23:07,719 –&gt; 00:23:14,199<br>routers that make up the internet, they too can be, we can eavesdrop into them. There’s eavesdropping</p>
<p>201<br>00:23:14,200 –&gt; 00:23:21,240<br>capabilities that have to be put in anyway just to maintain and have them work. But are the</p>
<p>202<br>00:23:21,240 –&gt; 00:23:26,600<br>builders of the equipment are they responsible for? Are they required in any way to provide the</p>
<p>203<br>00:23:26,600 –&gt; 00:23:37,400<br>means to the back door to be able to listen to communications? Well, if you’re asking whether there’s a</p>
<p>204<br>00:23:37,400 –&gt; 00:23:47,000<br>law or a regulation that affects the design of routers or servers or for that matter data centers,</p>
<p>205<br>00:23:47,000 –&gt; 00:23:52,519<br>so as to permit back doors, no is the answer to that question, at least in the United States.</p>
<p>206<br>00:23:54,519 –&gt; 00:24:01,000<br>Is that the regime in China? Well, that’s the matter of a tremendous amount of debate and the Chinese</p>
<p>207<br>00:24:01,000 –&gt; 00:24:07,080<br>would say no and a lot of other people would say the true answer in China is yes. So you have to ask</p>
<p>208<br>00:24:07,079 –&gt; 00:24:15,480<br>that question on a country by country basis. I see. It’s not, if I may say so, it’s not really,</p>
<p>209<br>00:24:15,480 –&gt; 00:24:23,399<br>I think, the most important question because of the big fact is that approximately four firms</p>
<p>210<br>00:24:23,399 –&gt; 00:24:29,559<br>that are headquartered in the United States gather the overwhelming amount of over the top</p>
<p>211<br>00:24:29,559 –&gt; 00:24:37,159<br>information and they are storing it and organizing it for their own commercial purposes and it’s all</p>
<p>212<br>00:24:37,159 –&gt; 00:24:44,679<br>there for the government to tap into and according to newspaper accounts, we don’t, I don’t have</p>
<p>213<br>00:24:44,679 –&gt; 00:24:53,000<br>anything to go by but that the national security agency has persuaded those companies to give access</p>
<p>214<br>00:24:53,000 –&gt; 00:24:59,319<br>to the data or according to a story two days ago, they didn’t even ask, they just went ahead and</p>
<p>215<br>00:24:59,319 –&gt; 00:25:05,720<br>got access to the data. Yes, yeah. I mean with hindsight, do you think that the government should</p>
<p>216<br>00:25:05,720 –&gt; 00:25:16,279<br>have played more of a positive role earlier on to either introduce regulation, for the over the top</p>
<p>217<br>00:25:16,279 –&gt; 00:25:23,799<br>industries to prevent that, either that consolidation into just four companies or put in place more</p>
<p>218<br>00:25:23,799 –&gt; 00:25:32,279<br>guidelines on how that data was stored and how much was stored in for a period. Well, I would give</p>
<p>219<br>00:25:32,279 –&gt; 00:25:39,000<br>no as my answer to both those questions and I would just want to point out for 20 straight years,</p>
<p>220<br>00:25:39,000 –&gt; 00:25:45,480<br>the tech industry in the United States and in most other countries but especially in the United</p>
<p>221<br>00:25:45,640 –&gt; 00:25:54,200<br>States, as vigorously stood for the proposition that the government should really not ever tell it what to do on any</p>
<p>222<br>00:25:54,200 –&gt; 00:26:03,400<br>topic whatsoever. Right. And the idea that the industry would have said, oh, we could use some regulation about design</p>
<p>223<br>00:26:04,599 –&gt; 00:26:09,960<br>and it’s really good if the government tells us when it might want to have access to the information,</p>
<p>224<br>00:26:10,920 –&gt; 00:26:22,039<br>that would have produced a firestorm of opposition and hostility and you have to ask, really what would have</p>
<p>225<br>00:26:22,039 –&gt; 00:26:30,840<br>been the point? Would anything be different if the government had over the past 20 years regulated</p>
<p>226<br>00:26:30,840 –&gt; 00:26:36,200<br>something about the design of the internet? I don’t think anything would have been different.</p>
<p>227<br>00:26:36,200 –&gt; 00:26:42,440<br>You’d still be facing the exact same questions we’re now facing, which really boiled on just one</p>
<p>228<br>00:26:42,440 –&gt; 00:26:52,200<br>question. So if for example, Google is going to gather all this data, then why shouldn’t a national</p>
<p>229<br>00:26:52,200 –&gt; 00:27:00,120<br>security agency be able to make a prediction about a potential bad actors, bad acts that’s just</p>
<p>230<br>00:27:00,279 –&gt; 00:27:06,359<br>accurate as a prediction Google might make about what advertisers will appeal to that person.</p>
<p>231<br>00:27:08,199 –&gt; 00:27:16,039<br>Right. So one area where the government seems to have got involved, it’s alleged that the national</p>
<p>232<br>00:27:16,039 –&gt; 00:27:21,479<br>security agency had influenced the data encryption standards to make them weaker and easier for</p>
<p>233<br>00:27:21,480 –&gt; 00:27:29,640<br>government to crack. And as a consequence, what do you think the consequences should</p>
<p>234<br>00:27:29,640 –&gt; 00:27:35,079<br>will be on the degree to which we trust our networks and the internet in general for our secure</p>
<p>235<br>00:27:35,079 –&gt; 00:27:42,440<br>communications? And what does it mean for the future of banking and e-commerce? Do you think this</p>
<p>236<br>00:27:42,440 –&gt; 00:27:50,279<br>will have a long-term detrimental effect? I think that the tech industry has not been able</p>
<p>237<br>00:27:51,079 –&gt; 00:28:01,639<br>to design and implement security at any level of the network in a way that’s been satisfactory to</p>
<p>238<br>00:28:01,639 –&gt; 00:28:10,440<br>anybody. So I would agree how hot to leave with that. Right. Probably it would be worth looking at</p>
<p>239<br>00:28:10,440 –&gt; 00:28:19,960<br>the eBay slash PayPal paper that was just published yesterday, which lays out a vision of the way</p>
<p>240<br>00:28:20,519 –&gt; 00:28:29,000<br>online monetary system or online payment system actually could work. And you could be you and your</p>
<p>241<br>00:28:29,000 –&gt; 00:28:35,160<br>students could be the judge of whether they’ve got a better idea about security. But I would say this</p>
<p>242<br>00:28:35,160 –&gt; 00:28:42,680<br>is a problem that remains to be solved. And unless it is solved in a public-private consensual</p>
<p>243<br>00:28:42,680 –&gt; 00:28:48,759<br>matter, then I think the future of the internet is going to be less than it should be.</p>
<p>244<br>00:28:50,680 –&gt; 00:28:55,960<br>And what do you think when we’re making this interview, it’s just a few days after the</p>
<p>245<br>00:28:57,080 –&gt; 00:29:01,960<br>the breaking news about the alleged US spying on Chancellor Merkel of Germany. What do you think</p>
<p>246<br>00:29:02,600 –&gt; 00:29:07,400<br>the international impact is going to be of these of these revelations?</p>
<p>247<br>00:29:08,040 –&gt; 00:29:19,480<br>Well, when I first went to China in the late 1990s as a member of the US government, I was advised</p>
<p>248<br>00:29:19,480 –&gt; 00:29:27,160<br>that it would probably be the case that my hotel room would be entered when I left it and that</p>
<p>249<br>00:29:27,160 –&gt; 00:29:33,560<br>people in the Chinese government would examine everything they could find there. And if I left</p>
<p>250<br>00:29:33,559 –&gt; 00:29:39,000<br>the computer, they would get into the computer and see what they could get out of it.</p>
<p>251<br>00:29:40,200 –&gt; 00:29:47,159<br>I would just like to say that they left the room very neatly arranged, but not in the same way</p>
<p>252<br>00:29:47,159 –&gt; 00:29:57,799<br>that I had left it. And let me go on to say that there’s nothing new under the sun. And as long as</p>
<p>253<br>00:29:57,799 –&gt; 00:30:03,159<br>there have been people in power, those people in power have wondered what other people in power</p>
<p>254<br>00:30:03,240 –&gt; 00:30:05,400<br>were doing and have tried to find that out.</p>
<p>255<br>00:30:07,720 –&gt; 00:30:15,080<br>Clearly, the allegations related to the recent allegations of listening into a foreign ally</p>
<p>256<br>00:30:15,080 –&gt; 00:30:23,240<br>and in Germany with the coast of East Germany, looming large, it has particular implications.</p>
<p>257<br>00:30:24,600 –&gt; 00:30:29,400<br>And do you think this will die down over the next few days or weeks? So do you think it’ll</p>
<p>258<br>00:30:29,400 –&gt; 00:30:36,280<br>actually change the way that we see privacy and the way in which different countries spy on each other?</p>
<p>259<br>00:30:38,040 –&gt; 00:30:44,280<br>You know, a lot of people think that the debate here is between privacy and security.</p>
<p>260<br>00:30:44,280 –&gt; 00:30:52,040<br>If you want to have security for everybody, you need to interfere or impinge on other people’s privacy.</p>
<p>261<br>00:30:52,759 –&gt; 00:31:00,599<br>My own view, which is shaped by reading a great book by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,</p>
<p>262<br>00:31:00,599 –&gt; 00:31:06,759<br>a book called Seekersie, which was published in 1998. My own view is that the real issue is</p>
<p>263<br>00:31:07,399 –&gt; 00:31:17,559<br>openness and closeness of public and secret. And that almost everything that government does today,</p>
<p>264<br>00:31:17,559 –&gt; 00:31:24,440<br>which is secret, really ought to be public, not everything, but almost everything.</p>
<p>265<br>00:31:25,159 –&gt; 00:31:31,879<br>And I don’t mean public in the sense of there ought to be constant Twitter feeds of everything</p>
<p>266<br>00:31:31,879 –&gt; 00:31:37,079<br>the government is finding out, but I do mean that governments everywhere ought to be more open</p>
<p>267<br>00:31:37,079 –&gt; 00:31:45,159<br>about what they are doing. And if that were the case, then I believe that it would be substantially</p>
<p>268<br>00:31:45,160 –&gt; 00:31:52,120<br>easier for communities, the citizens of the United States, for example, to form a consensus</p>
<p>269<br>00:31:52,120 –&gt; 00:32:01,080<br>about the appropriate limits of security and the appropriate rights of privacy. But the real</p>
<p>270<br>00:32:01,080 –&gt; 00:32:07,400<br>enemy of freedom is secrecy. Yeah, and I think that’s become very clear in the last few months,</p>
<p>271<br>00:32:07,400 –&gt; 00:32:13,960<br>is suddenly we become aware of many things which we may have suspected we’re going on, but</p>
<p>272<br>00:32:13,960 –&gt; 00:32:19,960<br>they’re thrust forward into the public debate. And if nothing else, for sure, the quality of that</p>
<p>273<br>00:32:19,960 –&gt; 00:32:25,480<br>debate has improved tremendously in the last few months because of the scrutiny that it’s come under</p>
<p>274<br>00:32:25,480 –&gt; 00:32:31,240<br>and it’s realizing how what a lack of transparency that has been in the past. So I would agree</p>
<p>275<br>00:32:31,240 –&gt; 00:32:36,200<br>very much with that sentiment. So if you were in, you know, if you were magically put in the position</p>
<p>276<br>00:32:36,279 –&gt; 00:32:44,680<br>to be able to sort of take charge, I’m not quite sure of what or of whom, what would be your</p>
<p>277<br>00:32:44,680 –&gt; 00:32:49,559<br>desire for how we would get to that place of greater openness and transparency?</p>
<p>278<br>00:32:51,799 –&gt; 00:32:58,759<br>I think you have to do a number of different things. So for example, in the United States,</p>
<p>279<br>00:32:58,759 –&gt; 00:33:04,519<br>according to reporters who have gotten access to some of these documents, there are well more than</p>
<p>280<br>00:33:04,519 –&gt; 00:33:12,759<br>a million people who have a security classification. Well, if it’s more than a million people who have it,</p>
<p>281<br>00:33:12,759 –&gt; 00:33:22,119<br>it’s not worth very much. Really, there should be almost no one who has access to the kinds of</p>
<p>282<br>00:33:22,839 –&gt; 00:33:31,240<br>conclusions that the computers run by the National Security Agency are able to draw about bad actors.</p>
<p>283<br>00:33:31,240 –&gt; 00:33:35,960<br>Second, those people should have terms of duty of not more than five years so that we don’t</p>
<p>284<br>00:33:36,519 –&gt; 00:33:43,880<br>empower by the power of secrets, certain individuals who have immense sway over government and other</p>
<p>285<br>00:33:43,880 –&gt; 00:33:51,880<br>and people in the private sector. Third, the nature of the information gathered by government ought</p>
<p>286<br>00:33:51,880 –&gt; 00:33:58,279<br>to be open. Not the details, but the generic categories. They all ought to be known so that everyone</p>
<p>287<br>00:33:58,279 –&gt; 00:34:05,000<br>understands what the government is doing. Again, not day by day or case by case, but in the abstract.</p>
<p>288<br>00:34:06,119 –&gt; 00:34:15,880<br>And then fourth, any individual who the government has targeted is going to need to be able to get</p>
<p>289<br>00:34:15,880 –&gt; 00:34:22,119<br>access if they’re charged with a crime where they’re prosecuted. They’re going to be able to,</p>
<p>290<br>00:34:22,119 –&gt; 00:34:27,480<br>they’re going to need to get access to the information the government used to target them.</p>
<p>291<br>00:34:28,680 –&gt; 00:34:32,840<br>Otherwise, you’re having trial by computer and you’re having trial by algorithm.</p>
<p>292<br>00:34:33,800 –&gt; 00:34:41,240<br>Now, that concept assumes that you’re innocent until proven guilty, but it also goes a little further</p>
<p>293<br>00:34:41,240 –&gt; 00:34:47,720<br>and says the issue of proof of guilt can’t totally be left to the computers and the government.</p>
<p>294<br>00:34:48,280 –&gt; 00:34:55,640<br>It has to be that the defendant, the accused, also has access to that same information and that same</p>
<p>295<br>00:34:55,639 –&gt; 00:35:02,039<br>data bank if the charges are brought. That balance doesn’t right now exist in American law.</p>
<p>296<br>00:35:04,359 –&gt; 00:35:11,000<br>Are you confident, optimistic that the current debate will help move us in that direction?</p>
<p>297<br>00:35:12,679 –&gt; 00:35:19,400<br>Yes, I am. I think it’s been, I think that the news stories have been immensely helpful.</p>
<p>298<br>00:35:19,880 –&gt; 00:35:29,720<br>I take with the green of salt some of the protestations of foreign leaders who are shocked and shocked</p>
<p>299<br>00:35:29,720 –&gt; 00:35:35,240<br>and shocked to find out that they’re spying that’s been going on. I guess for the first time in</p>
<p>300<br>00:35:35,240 –&gt; 00:35:43,880<br>history, this has been going on, is there a view? But I think that the overall the revelations are</p>
<p>301<br>00:35:43,880 –&gt; 00:35:48,039<br>leading to an open debate about that which ought to be open.</p>
<p>302<br>00:35:49,559 –&gt; 00:35:54,039<br>With that, I thank you very much and particularly thank you for</p>
<p>303<br>00:35:55,000 –&gt; 00:35:59,640<br>keeping this debate alive and for your participation in it. It certainly helped raise the</p>
<p>304<br>00:35:59,640 –&gt; 00:36:02,840<br>quality of the debate and discussion over the last few months. Thank you.</p>
<p>305<br>00:36:02,840 –&gt; 00:36:06,920<br>Thank you. Your honor to talk with you about it, Reed. Thank you, Nick. Good to be with you</p>
<p>306<br>00:36:06,920 –&gt; 00:36:08,360<br>and all of your, all of your clients.</p>
