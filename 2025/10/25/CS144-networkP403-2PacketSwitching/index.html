                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,679<br>In this video, I’m going to tell you about what packet switching is and why packet switching</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,679 –&gt; 00:00:08,120<br>is used in the internet.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,120 –&gt; 00:00:12,200<br>Packet switching was first described by Paul Barron in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,200 –&gt; 00:00:16,719<br>It describes the way in which packets of information aroused one by one across the internet to</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:16,719 –&gt; 00:00:21,839<br>their destination, just like letters are delivered by the post office.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:21,839 –&gt; 00:00:25,359<br>Packet switching is really important for us to understand because when we choose to use</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:25,359 –&gt; 00:00:31,399<br>packet switching, it dictates many of the properties of the network.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:31,399 –&gt; 00:00:37,240<br>Today I’m going to describe what packet switching is and why it was chosen for the internet.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:37,240 –&gt; 00:00:43,879<br>But first, to set some context, I’m going to tell you about a predecessor of packet switching</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:43,879 –&gt; 00:00:45,560<br>that was called circuit switching.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:45,560 –&gt; 00:00:49,920<br>And we’re all very familiar with circuit switching because it’s what’s used in the telephone</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:49,920 –&gt; 00:00:50,920<br>network.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:51,640 –&gt; 00:00:57,200<br>So the most common use of circuit switching is in the telephone, the traditional wired telephone</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:57,200 –&gt; 00:00:58,200<br>network.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:58,200 –&gt; 00:01:03,200<br>And we’re going to walk through what happens when we place a phone call from the phone</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:03,200 –&gt; 00:01:07,120<br>on the left to the one on the right.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:07,120 –&gt; 00:01:11,920<br>Now with the picture I’ve got here, it shows the telephone is being connected by a dedicated</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:11,920 –&gt; 00:01:16,359<br>wire and that wouldn’t make for a very interesting telephone system if we can only talk to one</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:16,359 –&gt; 00:01:17,840<br>other person.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:18,719 –&gt; 00:01:27,200<br>So in practice, the telephone’s are connected together through a dedicated wire down to a switching</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:27,200 –&gt; 00:01:29,400<br>center.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:29,400 –&gt; 00:01:36,080<br>So in the early days of telephony, back in the 1880s also, the dedicated wire went to a</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:36,080 –&gt; 00:01:37,560<br>switchboard operator.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:37,560 –&gt; 00:01:41,600<br>And the switchboard operator was a roomful of people who would take a dedicated wire from</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:41,600 –&gt; 00:01:47,560<br>the input and connect it to the dedicated wire to the phone that you were connecting to.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:47,560 –&gt; 00:01:49,600<br>So it was all manually connected.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:49,600 –&gt; 00:01:54,280<br>And the main point here is that the wire is dedicated for the phone conversation from the</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:54,280 –&gt; 00:01:58,879<br>start to the end of the phone call.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:58,879 –&gt; 00:02:02,920<br>Now in eighties of course, we don’t have roomful of switchboard operators.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:02,920 –&gt; 00:02:08,280<br>And these, instead we use automatic circuit switches that set up the circuit for us from</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:08,280 –&gt; 00:02:12,640<br>one phone to our friend’s phone at the other end.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:12,640 –&gt; 00:02:17,439<br>So it helps to think of a phone call having three phases.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:17,439 –&gt; 00:02:22,639<br>Once we pick up the handset and dial the number and dialing the number is saying, where do</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:22,639 –&gt; 00:02:24,439<br>we want to be connected to?</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:24,439 –&gt; 00:02:30,120<br>And this creates a dedicated circuit from one end to the other.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:30,120 –&gt; 00:02:33,840<br>So that dedicated circuit is going to go through all of the circuits along the way.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:33,840 –&gt; 00:02:38,960<br>And the system has told each of the circuits to connect an incoming wire to an outcoming</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:38,960 –&gt; 00:02:43,719<br>wire or an incoming circuit to an outcoming circuit.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:43,719 –&gt; 00:02:48,439<br>So each switch is going to maintain the state to map that incoming circuit to the correct</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:48,439 –&gt; 00:02:50,639<br>outgoing circuit.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:50,639 –&gt; 00:02:53,520<br>And then in the second phase, we talk.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:53,520 –&gt; 00:02:59,439<br>In a digital phone system like most phone systems are today, our voice is sampled and digitized</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:59,439 –&gt; 00:03:01,479<br>at the first switch.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:01,479 –&gt; 00:03:07,919<br>And then it’s sent over the dedicated circuit as a typically a 64 kilobit per second channel</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:07,919 –&gt; 00:03:10,280<br>for voice.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:10,280 –&gt; 00:03:14,319<br>So our phone conversation has a dedicated circuit or channel all the way along the path and</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:14,319 –&gt; 00:03:17,319<br>the circuit is not shared with anyone else.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:17,319 –&gt; 00:03:22,360<br>And then finally when we hang up, the circuit has to be removed and any state and the switches</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:22,360 –&gt; 00:03:28,520<br>along the path has to be removed as well.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:28,520 –&gt; 00:03:36,000<br>So in practice between the switches, there are trunk lines which are really, really fast.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:36,000 –&gt; 00:03:38,879<br>In other words, they have a very high data rate.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:38,879 –&gt; 00:03:41,840<br>Even the slow ones are in at two and a half gig of it per second.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:41,840 –&gt; 00:03:47,199<br>And the fastest ones today run at 40 or even 100 gig of it per second.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:47,199 –&gt; 00:03:51,479<br>Sometimes you’ll hear people call these big trunk lines big fat pipes because of the volume</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:51,479 –&gt; 00:03:53,960<br>of data they can send.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:53,960 –&gt; 00:03:59,359<br>But actually, these big fat pipes are really tiny, skinny little optical fibers thinner than</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:59,359 –&gt; 00:04:01,400<br>one over your hairs.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:01,400 –&gt; 00:04:06,599<br>Many thousands of phone calls can share that same trunk line between cities, each in its own</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:06,599 –&gt; 00:04:09,560<br>dedicated circuit.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:09,560 –&gt; 00:04:14,840<br>The key thing here to remember is every phone call has its own dedicated 64 kilobit per</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:14,840 –&gt; 00:04:20,800<br>second circuit that it doesn’t have to share with anybody else.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:20,800 –&gt; 00:04:26,759<br>So in summary, we can think of circuit switching as having the following characteristics.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:26,759 –&gt; 00:04:31,480<br>Each call has its own private guaranteed isolated data rate from end to end.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:32,200 –&gt; 00:04:36,680<br>Second, call has three phases, establish, communicate and close.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:36,680 –&gt; 00:04:42,840<br>And third, originally a circuit was an end to end physical wire, but nowadays it’s made</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:42,840 –&gt; 00:04:44,240<br>up of a virtual private wire.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:44,240 –&gt; 00:04:49,879<br>It’s going to share that wire with others, but it has its own dedicated circuit within</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:49,879 –&gt; 00:04:50,879<br>that wire.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:50,879 –&gt; 00:04:54,280<br>There are a few problems with circuit switching.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:54,280 –&gt; 00:04:58,520<br>Clearly it’s worked very well for the phone system, but when we’re thinking about using</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:58,519 –&gt; 00:05:04,159<br>circuits switching for the internet or any computer communications, there are a few</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:04,159 –&gt; 00:05:06,680<br>shortcomings that we need to consider.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:06,680 –&gt; 00:05:10,719<br>So I’m going to go through three main problems.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:10,719 –&gt; 00:05:15,120<br>The first one is it’s inefficient.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:15,120 –&gt; 00:05:18,680<br>When computers communicate, they tend to be very bursty.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:18,680 –&gt; 00:05:26,000<br>We tend to send data in bursts of maybe a few seconds, a few packets, maybe even a few</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:26,000 –&gt; 00:05:28,439<br>minutes, depending on the application that we’re running.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:28,439 –&gt; 00:05:35,160<br>For example, if I’m typing over an SSH connection, then I’m going to have characters that I’m</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:35,160 –&gt; 00:05:39,160<br>going to send every now and again, sometimes a flurry of characters as I type a word, and</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:39,160 –&gt; 00:05:41,680<br>then long periods of silence in between.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:41,680 –&gt; 00:05:45,720<br>Or if I’m reading a sequence of web pages, I might have a burst as I fill up one page,</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:45,720 –&gt; 00:05:51,120<br>a burst as I fill up the figures to populate that page, and then a little period of pause</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:51,120 –&gt; 00:05:53,120<br>while I read those web pages.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:53,120 –&gt; 00:05:54,959<br>So it tends to be very bursty.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:55,680 –&gt; 00:06:02,719<br>And of course, during those times of silence when I’m not doing anything, there’s no activity,</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:02,719 –&gt; 00:06:06,039<br>I’ve got this dedicated circuit which nobody else can use.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:06,039 –&gt; 00:06:07,199<br>So it’s very inefficient.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:07,199 –&gt; 00:06:13,319<br>Very inefficient use of the capacity of the network as a whole.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:13,319 –&gt; 00:06:18,599<br>The second thing is computers tend to have very diverse applications that need very different</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:18,599 –&gt; 00:06:20,519<br>rates.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:20,519 –&gt; 00:06:22,279<br>Committees communicate at many, many different rates.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:22,279 –&gt; 00:06:29,719<br>So a web server might be streaming video at say, one, five, or even six megabits per second.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:29,719 –&gt; 00:06:34,000<br>But if you compare that with me typing one character every second, there’s a huge difference</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:34,000 –&gt; 00:06:37,039<br>in the rates that the network needs to support.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:37,039 –&gt; 00:06:42,959<br>So if we pick a fixed rate circuit for the video, and then I use it for typing, it’ll</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:42,959 –&gt; 00:06:47,719<br>be barely used or vice versa, then I wouldn’t even be able to stream the video.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:47,719 –&gt; 00:06:52,199<br>So a fixed rate circuit really isn’t much use at all.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:52,199 –&gt; 00:06:56,399<br>The third one, the third problem with circuit switching is all of the state that we need</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:56,399 –&gt; 00:06:57,399<br>to maintain.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:57,399 –&gt; 00:07:01,000<br>We need to maintain some state for every phone call that’s going on.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:01,000 –&gt; 00:07:04,459<br>Every time we’ve established a call, we need to set up the circuit mapping from the</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:04,459 –&gt; 00:07:08,399<br>ingress to the egress of every switch along the way.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:08,399 –&gt; 00:07:12,879<br>If a circuit fails or a switch fails or a link fails, we need to go in and change all of</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:12,879 –&gt; 00:07:16,120<br>that state in order to reroute the calls.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:16,120 –&gt; 00:07:17,120<br>So we have to manage it.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:17,120 –&gt; 00:07:19,719<br>And then at the end, we need to remember to take the state out.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:20,200 –&gt; 00:07:24,920<br>If anything fails, then we may find that the state becomes inconsistent and then we have</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:24,920 –&gt; 00:07:25,920<br>a problem.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:25,920 –&gt; 00:07:29,560<br>So state management in circuit switches is considered a problem.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:29,560 –&gt; 00:07:33,680<br>And if we had thousands or hundreds of thousands of communications going on at the same time,</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:33,680 –&gt; 00:07:38,520<br>that’s just a lot of work that has to be done.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:38,520 –&gt; 00:07:46,360<br>So let’s take a look at the packet switching in contrast to circuit switching.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:46,360 –&gt; 00:07:49,120<br>So again, we’re going to look at two end systems communicating.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:49,120 –&gt; 00:07:54,080<br>In this case, we’re going to look at this laptop on the left A and it’s going to be talking</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:54,080 –&gt; 00:08:03,080<br>to the server on the right B. In practice, these of course could be anywhere in the internet.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:03,080 –&gt; 00:08:08,960<br>To impact the switching, there’s no dedicated circuit to carry our data.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:08,960 –&gt; 00:08:13,960<br>Instead, we just send when we’re ready, and anytime we want, we send a block of data by</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:13,960 –&gt; 00:08:15,920<br>adding ahead to it.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:15,920 –&gt; 00:08:18,680<br>That’s what we call the packet.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:18,680 –&gt; 00:08:22,480<br>And the header contains the address of where the packet is going, just like an envelope</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:22,480 –&gt; 00:08:28,680<br>tells us the post office where to send the letter.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:28,680 –&gt; 00:08:36,800<br>Packet switch network consists of the end hosts, the links and packet switches.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:36,800 –&gt; 00:08:44,360<br>When we send a packet, it’s routed one hopper to time from the source, in this case, the</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:44,360 –&gt; 00:08:50,120<br>laptop A, all the way through to the destination B. If you look at the packet, it has the data</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:50,120 –&gt; 00:08:55,919<br>in it and it also has the address B of where it’s going to.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:55,919 –&gt; 00:08:58,919<br>We’ll see later that packets are a little bit more complicated than this, but this is the</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:58,919 –&gt; 00:09:01,279<br>bear information, the minimum information that it needs.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:01,279 –&gt; 00:09:10,480<br>The data we want to get to be, and then the address B of where it’s going to.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:10,480 –&gt; 00:09:14,720<br>So when we send the packet, it’s going to be routed hop by hop from the source to the</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:14,720 –&gt; 00:09:16,360<br>destination.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:16,360 –&gt; 00:09:21,519<br>Each packet switch along the way is going to look up the address in a forwarding table.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:21,519 –&gt; 00:09:24,600<br>So it keeps the local forwarding table in all of the packet switches.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:24,600 –&gt; 00:09:31,680<br>And here I’ve got a forwarding table saying if we see the address B, then we’re going to</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:31,680 –&gt; 00:09:39,240<br>send it to on the next hop to S2, and this is S2 over here.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:39,240 –&gt; 00:09:44,919<br>So once this switch S1 sees this packet, it’s going to look it up in its table and send</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:44,919 –&gt; 00:09:48,960<br>it along to switch S2.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:48,960 –&gt; 00:09:50,759<br>And this is it going along its way.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:50,759 –&gt; 00:09:53,960<br>Switch S2 will have its own table, and of course that table is going to be different from</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:53,960 –&gt; 00:09:58,120<br>S1’s, because it’s going to have a different set of next hops for each of the addresses that</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:58,120 –&gt; 00:09:59,879<br>it sees.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:59,879 –&gt; 00:10:04,039<br>So then it’s going to send it along its way this time to S4, and then eventually to the</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:04,039 –&gt; 00:10:05,399<br>correct destination.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:10,240 –&gt; 00:10:16,279<br>So in the internet, there’s lots of different types of packet switch.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:16,279 –&gt; 00:10:22,159<br>Some of them are called routers, because they deal with addresses that are internet addresses,</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:22,159 –&gt; 00:10:28,120<br>and they may include little routers that we have in our desks at home, or huge routers</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:28,120 –&gt; 00:10:30,879<br>that are in big wiring closets and big switching centers.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:30,879 –&gt; 00:10:32,600<br>But we call those routers.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:32,600 –&gt; 00:10:34,960<br>There are also things called ethernet switches, and we’re going to look at the difference</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:34,960 –&gt; 00:10:42,200<br>between different types of packets which in a later lecture.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:42,200 –&gt; 00:10:47,600<br>I showed you one packet, and of course at any instance there’s going to be many packets</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:47,600 –&gt; 00:10:51,200<br>flowing across the internet, millions and millions of packets flowing, and all sorts of</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:51,200 –&gt; 00:10:52,200<br>different.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:52,200 –&gt; 00:10:58,320<br>And they’re all being routed, hop by hop, one at a time, by the packets which is along</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:58,320 –&gt; 00:10:59,320<br>the path.</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:59,320 –&gt; 00:11:03,519<br>So there’ll be many flows of communication going in all sorts of directions at the same</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:03,519 –&gt; 00:11:04,519<br>time.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:04,519 –&gt; 00:11:08,799<br>So these packets which is how a lot of work to do, and remember, they’re routing each packet</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:08,799 –&gt; 00:11:16,519<br>one at a time by picking the next hop that it goes to and sending it on its way.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:16,519 –&gt; 00:11:20,840<br>We’re going to take a quick look inside packet switches at some of their relevant features.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:20,840 –&gt; 00:11:25,199<br>So we already told you that packets which have a forwarding table to tell it where the</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:25,199 –&gt; 00:11:27,079<br>packet goes next.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:27,079 –&gt; 00:11:29,240<br>They also have to have buffers.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:29,240 –&gt; 00:11:30,600<br>So packets which have buffers.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:30,600 –&gt; 00:11:32,759<br>And let me explain why that is.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:32,759 –&gt; 00:11:38,319<br>So in the middle here we’ve got a packet switch, and this packet switch is going to be receiving</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:38,319 –&gt; 00:11:41,799<br>these two packets that I’ve got here and here.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:41,799 –&gt; 00:11:46,639<br>So we’re going to look at what happens as these packets go through the packet switch.</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:46,639 –&gt; 00:11:52,360<br>If they both arrive at the same time, and let’s say they’re arriving at the full line</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:52,360 –&gt; 00:11:59,000<br>rate of the outgoing link, then the packet switch has to hold one of them while it sends</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:59,000 –&gt; 00:12:00,000<br>the other.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:00,000 –&gt; 00:12:01,399<br>They’re sending them both at the same time.</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:01,399 –&gt; 00:12:04,399<br>So it’s going to send one at a time.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:04,399 –&gt; 00:12:08,279<br>And because it might have many incoming links, the packets which has to have a buffer to</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:08,279 –&gt; 00:12:10,120<br>hold, perhaps, many, many packets.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:10,120 –&gt; 00:12:17,279<br>And we’re going to see that these packets, these buffers can be quite large in practice.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:17,279 –&gt; 00:12:21,519<br>So the buffers hold packets when two or more packets arrive at the same time.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:21,519 –&gt; 00:12:25,480<br>And particularly during periods of congestion, when there’s lots and lots of packets coming</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:25,480 –&gt; 00:12:29,879<br>in and all of these input links, all trying to get to the same output, it may actually</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:30,080 –&gt; 00:12:39,799<br>have quite big buffers to hold packets during those times of congestion.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:39,799 –&gt; 00:12:45,480<br>So in summary, packets are routed individually by looking up the address in the router’s</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:45,480 –&gt; 00:12:47,720<br>local forwarding table.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:47,720 –&gt; 00:12:51,439<br>All packets share the full capacity of a link.</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:51,439 –&gt; 00:12:55,440<br>And third, the routers maintain no per communication state.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:55,440 –&gt; 00:12:58,120<br>And this is really quite key.</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:58,120 –&gt; 00:13:02,879<br>In a circuit switch, remember, we need to maintain state associated with every circuit along</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:02,879 –&gt; 00:13:05,399<br>the every every circuit with maintaining.</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:05,399 –&gt; 00:13:07,679<br>Here we know we maintain none.</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:07,679 –&gt; 00:13:10,200<br>We just maintain the forwarding table.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:10,200 –&gt; 00:13:17,440<br>And then there’s no per communication, no per packet or no per flow state associated with</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:17,440 –&gt; 00:13:19,120<br>that communication.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:19,120 –&gt; 00:13:22,799<br>So why does the internet use packet switching?</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:22,799 –&gt; 00:13:26,120<br>Probably pretty obvious by now, but I really wanted to spell that out.</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:26,120 –&gt; 00:13:31,600<br>There were three original reasons, two that I’ve got listed here, the internet used</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:31,600 –&gt; 00:13:33,360<br>packet switching.</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:33,360 –&gt; 00:13:39,320<br>The first two are very obvious in common from what I’ve just described.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:39,320 –&gt; 00:13:45,200<br>The first one is packet switching allows us to use expensive links efficiently.</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:45,200 –&gt; 00:13:47,360<br>So efficient use of expensive links.</p>
<p>198<br>00:13:47,360 –&gt; 00:13:49,799<br>Links were assumed to be expensive and scarce.</p>
<p>199<br>00:13:49,799 –&gt; 00:13:54,320<br>The first links that interconnected the packets which is across the backbone of the internet</p>
<p>200<br>00:13:54,320 –&gt; 00:13:56,879<br>were running at a few kilobits per second.</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:56,879 –&gt; 00:14:01,800<br>So they were expensive and everybody knew that they would become there would be a scarce</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:01,800 –&gt; 00:14:04,040<br>resort resource.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:04,040 –&gt; 00:14:10,680<br>Packet switching allows many many bursty flows to share that same links very efficiently.</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:10,680 –&gt; 00:14:14,640<br>Because at any one instant, the packet can use the entire link, but it can be immediately</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:14,640 –&gt; 00:14:20,840<br>followed by another packet using the entire link belonging to a different communication.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:20,840 –&gt; 00:14:23,639<br>So it was a famous textbook by Patikas and Galakets.</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:23,639 –&gt; 00:14:27,080<br>So it’s a circuit switching is rarely used for data networks because of very inefficient</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:27,080 –&gt; 00:14:29,480<br>use of the links.</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:29,480 –&gt; 00:14:36,519<br>So the second big reason for using packet switching was it’s widely felt that the packet</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:36,519 –&gt; 00:14:41,320<br>switching allows for more resilient networks, networks that are resilient to the failure</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:41,320 –&gt; 00:14:44,240<br>of links and routers.</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:44,240 –&gt; 00:14:50,639<br>And the reason for this is that because each packet is individually routed along the path,</p>
<p>213<br>00:14:50,639 –&gt; 00:14:57,120<br>if something happens, if something breaks, a link breaks or a router breaks, then we can</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:57,120 –&gt; 00:15:03,039<br>because we have no state in all of the switches for this particular flow, we can simply send</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:03,039 –&gt; 00:15:05,080<br>the packet on a different path.</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:05,080 –&gt; 00:15:12,000<br>We can send it over a different link to a different router and it will find its way eventually.</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:12,000 –&gt; 00:15:16,960<br>So for this reason, Tanembao and another famous textbook had said, for high reliability,</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:16,960 –&gt; 00:15:19,120<br>the internet was to be a datagram subnet.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:19,120 –&gt; 00:15:24,639<br>So if some lines and routers were destroyed, messages could easily be rerouted.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:24,639 –&gt; 00:15:29,480<br>And the third big reason that the internet used packet switching was the internet was originally</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:29,480 –&gt; 00:15:33,159<br>designed as an interconnection of existing networks.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:33,159 –&gt; 00:15:40,440<br>And at that time, pretty much all widely used communication networks, all computer networks</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:40,440 –&gt; 00:15:41,759<br>were packet switched.</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:41,759 –&gt; 00:15:46,600<br>And so if the internet was to interconnect all of those existing networks, then it too</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:46,600 –&gt; 00:15:49,159<br>needed to be packet switched as well.</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:49,159 –&gt; 00:15:52,840<br>Okay, this is the end of the first video about packet switching.</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:52,840 –&gt; 00:15:58,040<br>By now, we should be able to answer these three questions very easily.</p>
<p>228<br>00:15:58,040 –&gt; 00:16:02,639<br>In the next few videos, we’re going to learn more about packet switching, some basic definitions,</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:02,639 –&gt; 00:16:06,560<br>some ways to model packet switching, and some properties of packet switching that have been</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:06,560 –&gt; 00:16:08,040<br>developed over the years.</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:08,040 –&gt; 00:16:08,320<br>See you soon.</p>
