                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,040<br>This video is a continuation about packet switching and in this video I’m going to be talking</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,040 –&gt; 00:00:11,359<br>about a number of different Q models.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,359 –&gt; 00:00:15,200<br>I’m going to start out by describing a simple deterministic Q model.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:15,200 –&gt; 00:00:19,440<br>This is something that’s going to help us understand the dynamics of many simple Q systems.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:19,440 –&gt; 00:00:25,640<br>It often works as a good way of understanding what’s going on in the network.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,640 –&gt; 00:00:28,199<br>Here’s a router.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:28,199 –&gt; 00:00:33,920<br>As we know already, routers have to have Qs in the interface the whole packet during</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:33,920 –&gt; 00:00:35,399<br>times of congestion.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:35,399 –&gt; 00:00:38,320<br>This is where the variability in Qing-Datelae takes place.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:38,320 –&gt; 00:00:43,920<br>If we can understand the dynamics, even just having a rough sense of the dynamics of that</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:43,920 –&gt; 00:00:49,040<br>Q, it really helps us understand the end to end Qing-Delae and the dynamics of the network.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:49,040 –&gt; 00:00:51,320<br>We’re going to take a closer look at this.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:51,320 –&gt; 00:00:54,000<br>We’re going to just create a simple model.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:54,000 –&gt; 00:00:57,159<br>Here are the main characteristics of this Q. I’m going to draw a Q like this.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:57,159 –&gt; 00:01:02,880<br>This is the standard way to draw a Q showing where the packets will be stored.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:02,880 –&gt; 00:01:08,480<br>In that router Q, this is a four-port router, so packets could be coming in from any of the</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:08,480 –&gt; 00:01:14,079<br>interfaces into that Q, and then they will depart under the outgoing link.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:14,079 –&gt; 00:01:20,680<br>We’re going to say that that Q has an occupancy of Q of T. So at time T, it has Q packets</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:20,680 –&gt; 00:01:22,400<br>or bytes in it.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:23,280 –&gt; 00:01:30,600<br>It’s going to be useful to think about the aggregate or the cumulative departure process.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:30,600 –&gt; 00:01:36,719<br>That is, all of the packets or all of the bytes that have departed up until some time T.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:36,719 –&gt; 00:01:40,760<br>Similarly, it’s going to be useful to think of the cumulative arrivals, the total number</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:40,760 –&gt; 00:01:44,719<br>of packets that have arrived up until time T.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:44,719 –&gt; 00:01:49,680<br>Finally, because the outgoing link typically has a deterministic and fixed rate, which</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:49,680 –&gt; 00:01:51,520<br>can say has a fixed rate of R.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:51,599 –&gt; 00:01:54,920<br>They’re going to be the main parameters of our model.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:57,959 –&gt; 00:02:03,199<br>We can also think of a Q as being like a bucket full of water.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:03,199 –&gt; 00:02:04,759<br>Here’s a simple example here.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:04,759 –&gt; 00:02:10,359<br>A of T is the cumulative number of bytes that have arrived up until time T.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:10,359 –&gt; 00:02:15,439<br>D of T is the cumulative number of bytes that have departed up until time T.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:15,520 –&gt; 00:02:20,520<br>In this example, they’re going to depart at a fixed link rate of R.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:21,919 –&gt; 00:02:25,759<br>At any one time, there may be some bytes that have arrived, but haven’t yet departed.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:25,759 –&gt; 00:02:28,680<br>They’re the ones sitting in the bucket here.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:28,680 –&gt; 00:02:33,159<br>The occupancy of that bucket is going to be Q of T.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:33,159 –&gt; 00:02:35,400<br>So this is like a simple model of RQ.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:35,400 –&gt; 00:02:38,240<br>It’s just another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:38,240 –&gt; 00:02:42,240<br>We can draw the evolution of this as a function of time.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:42,240 –&gt; 00:02:44,840<br>I’m trying to try and sketch how this might look.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:44,840 –&gt; 00:02:47,680<br>So here are going to be the axes of my graph.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:47,680 –&gt; 00:02:53,000<br>As a function of time, we’re going to look at the cumulative number of bytes.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:53,000 –&gt; 00:02:55,520<br>So remember this is cumulative.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:55,520 –&gt; 00:03:02,319<br>I’m going to first look at the arrival process A of T.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:02,319 –&gt; 00:03:07,759<br>Bites tend to arrive as part of a packet, and they’re going to arrive at some particular</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:07,759 –&gt; 00:03:09,560<br>link arrival rate.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:09,560 –&gt; 00:03:13,000<br>So I’m going to draw what that cumulative arrival process might look like.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:13,000 –&gt; 00:03:17,159<br>It could look like anything, but here is the bytes arriving a packet.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:17,159 –&gt; 00:03:20,120<br>This is the gap between the first packet and the second packet.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:20,120 –&gt; 00:03:25,319<br>Here’s a bunch more bytes arriving, a gap, maybe it’s a long gap this time, and then a new</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:25,319 –&gt; 00:03:27,240<br>packet arriving.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:27,240 –&gt; 00:03:33,439<br>So this is supposed to be a straight line, and this would be the arrival rate of the packet</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:33,439 –&gt; 00:03:36,920<br>on the incoming link, and this is the number of bytes.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:36,920 –&gt; 00:03:42,920<br>So let’s say that the packet is of length P, the number of bytes of that first packet.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:42,919 –&gt; 00:03:45,399<br>Now let’s look at what the departure process might look like.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:45,399 –&gt; 00:03:51,199<br>I’m going to try and draw what I’m just going to label this as A of T, the cumulative arrival</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:51,199 –&gt; 00:03:52,199<br>process.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:52,199 –&gt; 00:03:55,599<br>And then in yellow, I’m going to try and draw the, I’m going to sketch out what the departure</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:55,599 –&gt; 00:03:57,439<br>process might look like.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:57,439 –&gt; 00:04:03,639<br>We know that the departure process is going to work at an unoperate at rate R.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:03,639 –&gt; 00:04:07,879<br>So at some point after that first packet has arrived, let’s assume that it’s a store</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:07,879 –&gt; 00:04:08,879<br>and forward model.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:08,879 –&gt; 00:04:09,879<br>It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:09,879 –&gt; 00:04:11,560<br>That’s just for the sake of my example.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:11,560 –&gt; 00:04:15,879<br>So at this time here, the packet has arrived, and then we’ll say, okay, it’s going to</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:15,879 –&gt; 00:04:21,399<br>depart at rate R. So that’s going to be my gradient there.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:21,399 –&gt; 00:04:25,959<br>So that’s rate R. That packet are right in that packet departing.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:25,959 –&gt; 00:04:27,959<br>At this point, there’s nothing left.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:27,959 –&gt; 00:04:35,519<br>So we’re going to wait until there’s a whole new packet in the queue, and then we’re going</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:35,519 –&gt; 00:04:40,079<br>to depart again at rate R. That’s going to be rate R.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:40,079 –&gt; 00:04:43,479<br>And so on, we’re going to wait until the whole new packet, and it’ll be at rate R again.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:43,479 –&gt; 00:04:45,479<br>So this might be one way in which it evolves.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:45,479 –&gt; 00:04:49,240<br>The point here is not the particular shape of this graph, but just to say you can easily</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:49,240 –&gt; 00:04:53,199<br>sketch the arrival and departure process.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:53,199 –&gt; 00:04:57,479<br>And what this kind of a cool property of this is that we can immediately from this tell</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:57,479 –&gt; 00:05:01,159<br>some nice characteristics of the system.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:01,159 –&gt; 00:05:06,560<br>First of all, we can immediately tell how, what the value of queue of T is.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:06,560 –&gt; 00:05:08,280<br>Is it any one time?</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:08,280 –&gt; 00:05:13,759<br>So if we were to pick a particular time, queue of T is the number of bytes that have arrived,</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:13,759 –&gt; 00:05:15,160<br>but not yet departed.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:15,160 –&gt; 00:05:21,439<br>So it’s simply d of T minus a of T. I’m sorry, a of T minus d of T. So it’s the number</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:21,439 –&gt; 00:05:24,079<br>that have arrived minus those that have departed.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:24,079 –&gt; 00:05:29,360<br>So for example, if we were to take a line here, down to here, so a vertical, supposed to</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:29,360 –&gt; 00:05:35,920<br>be a vertical line, that value, that distance between the two of those is queue of T. So</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:36,000 –&gt; 00:05:40,240<br>at any one time, it’s the occupancy of that queue.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:40,240 –&gt; 00:05:46,720<br>Similarly, if we look at a particular byte that arrives, say at this time here, if we assume</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:46,720 –&gt; 00:05:53,360<br>that all bytes arrive and then depart in the same order, then this byte, because it’s</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:53,360 –&gt; 00:05:56,560<br>this particular cumulative byte, we know that it departs here.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:56,560 –&gt; 00:06:01,560<br>So if we take the horizontal distance between these two lines, this is going to tell us</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:01,560 –&gt; 00:06:06,439<br>the d of T, I’ll call it little d of T, the delay through the queue.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:06,439 –&gt; 00:06:10,680<br>So this is a very useful model giving us an intuition.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:10,680 –&gt; 00:06:16,199<br>I often sketch graphs like this when I’m trying to understand the dynamics of a queue</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:16,199 –&gt; 00:06:19,480<br>or a dynamics of a system.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:19,480 –&gt; 00:06:28,240<br>Okay, then to summarize, we can say that the queue occupancy, so queue occupancy, queue</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:28,240 –&gt; 00:06:35,360<br>of T, equals, it’s the ones that have arrived minus the ones that have departed.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:35,360 –&gt; 00:06:37,360<br>So a nice and simple expression for that.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:37,360 –&gt; 00:06:44,160<br>And that d of T is the time spent in the queue by a byte that arrived at time T.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:44,160 –&gt; 00:06:49,519<br>So it’s the time spent in the queue,</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:49,519 –&gt; 00:07:01,680<br>in the queue by a byte arriving at time T.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:01,680 –&gt; 00:07:06,560<br>And that’s simply the horizontal distance between those two lines.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:06,560 –&gt; 00:07:12,680<br>Now, the assumption of this is always that it’s first come, first serve, or FIFO, we’ll</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:12,680 –&gt; 00:07:16,719<br>say first in, first out, in this context, those have the same meaning.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:16,720 –&gt; 00:07:20,480<br>So that’s true, if the bytes didn’t arrive and depart in the same order, then we couldn’t</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:20,480 –&gt; 00:07:23,920<br>make this statement here about d of T, because we don’t know that we’re referring to the</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:23,920 –&gt; 00:07:26,040<br>same byte.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:26,040 –&gt; 00:07:30,120<br>Let’s go on and look at an example now of how we might use this.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:30,120 –&gt; 00:07:32,000<br>So I’m going to work through an example.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:32,000 –&gt; 00:07:38,720<br>We’re going to assume that every second a hundred bit packet is going to arrive to a queue</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:38,720 –&gt; 00:07:40,560<br>at rate 1000 bits per second.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:40,560 –&gt; 00:07:45,240<br>In other words, this packet is going to arrive at a rate of 1000 bits per second, and it’s</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:45,240 –&gt; 00:07:48,040<br>a hundred bits long.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:48,040 –&gt; 00:07:53,160<br>We’re going to assume the maximum departure rate, that was our R, is 500 bits per second.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:53,160 –&gt; 00:07:56,960<br>And the question is, what is the average occupancy of the queue?</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:56,960 –&gt; 00:08:02,280<br>So just reading the question, it’s not so obvious, but if we plot this in the way that I</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:02,280 –&gt; 00:08:09,720<br>did before, I’m not going to try and sketch it, because I want these numbers to be very clear.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:10,720 –&gt; 00:08:15,240<br>A of T shown in rate here is the arrival process.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:15,240 –&gt; 00:08:17,840<br>This here is the packet arriving.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:17,840 –&gt; 00:08:22,640<br>It’s the hundred bit packet arriving at rate 1000 bits per second.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:22,640 –&gt; 00:08:27,360<br>So therefore it takes a tenth of a second, point one of a second to arrive.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:27,360 –&gt; 00:08:30,680<br>The maximum departure rate is 500 bits per second, it’s slower.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:30,680 –&gt; 00:08:37,800<br>So our departure rate, the departure d of T, the rate here is that the gradient of that</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:37,800 –&gt; 00:08:39,519<br>is 500 bits per second.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:39,519 –&gt; 00:08:46,079<br>So that 100 bit packet is going to take point two of a second in order to depart.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:46,079 –&gt; 00:08:51,840<br>In the previous example, I showed it as a store and forward of each packet.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:51,840 –&gt; 00:08:55,240<br>Here I didn’t, and that’s just a choice, and I just made that choice when answering</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:55,240 –&gt; 00:08:56,240<br>the question.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:56,240 –&gt; 00:09:00,360<br>The question isn’t clear as to which way it is.</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:00,360 –&gt; 00:09:06,439<br>So we can now see the time evolution of queue of T, which is the vertical difference between</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:06,440 –&gt; 00:09:09,840<br>those two lines and the delay of an individual packet.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:09,840 –&gt; 00:09:14,360<br>But the question is, what is the average occupancy of the queue?</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:14,360 –&gt; 00:09:16,840<br>Well, let’s look at how we might solve that.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:16,840 –&gt; 00:09:21,000<br>I’m going to rate this out just so that you have a clear record of this.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:21,000 –&gt; 00:09:22,840<br>So the solution is this.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:22,840 –&gt; 00:09:27,360<br>During each repeating one second cycle, the queue is going to fill at rate 500 bits per second</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:27,360 –&gt; 00:09:29,200<br>for a tenth of a second.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:29,200 –&gt; 00:09:32,200<br>So that was my arrival process here.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:32,200 –&gt; 00:09:40,759<br>And it drains at 500 bits per second for, then drains at 500 bits per second for point</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:40,759 –&gt; 00:09:42,879<br>one of a second.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:42,879 –&gt; 00:09:50,200<br>Over the first two tenths of a second, the average queue occupancy is therefore 0.5 times</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:50,200 –&gt; 00:09:57,040<br>0.1 times 500 equals 25 bits.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:57,040 –&gt; 00:10:00,320<br>The queue is empty for eight tenths of a second every cycle.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:00,320 –&gt; 00:10:02,000<br>That’s from here to here.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:02,000 –&gt; 00:10:11,240<br>So the average queue occupancy, queue bar of T, is 0.2 of a second when it’s 25 bits and</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:11,240 –&gt; 00:10:13,080<br>0.8 of a second when it’s 0.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:13,080 –&gt; 00:10:19,679<br>So the average queue occupancy is 5 bits.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:19,679 –&gt; 00:10:24,559<br>Continuing with our theme of simple deterministic queue models, I want to explain why it is that</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:24,559 –&gt; 00:10:30,360<br>small packets can reduce and to end the way.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:30,360 –&gt; 00:10:35,600<br>You may have been wondering why we can’t simply send an entire message in one packet.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:35,600 –&gt; 00:10:39,200<br>Why is it that we have to break messages down into smaller packets?</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:39,200 –&gt; 00:10:43,919<br>There’s a very good reason for this and I want to explain this in terms of the end to</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:43,919 –&gt; 00:10:45,320<br>end delay.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:45,320 –&gt; 00:10:53,600<br>So on the left, I’ve got an example of a message of length R that’s being delivered from</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:53,600 –&gt; 00:10:55,440<br>end to end.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:55,440 –&gt; 00:11:00,560<br>This is going through three routers, R1, R2 and R3.</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:00,560 –&gt; 00:11:04,760<br>And I’m just showing as we did before, the delay across each link in terms of the packet</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:04,760 –&gt; 00:11:10,080<br>ization delay and the propagation delay over the links as it makes it way across the network.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:10,080 –&gt; 00:11:12,600<br>We already know the expression for the end to end delay for this.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:12,600 –&gt; 00:11:17,360<br>It’s simply made up of the sum of all the M over RIs.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:17,360 –&gt; 00:11:19,280<br>This is the packetization delay.</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:19,280 –&gt; 00:11:24,240<br>And then the sum of the all of the propagation delays over the links.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:24,240 –&gt; 00:11:27,840<br>So we’ve seen this before.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:27,840 –&gt; 00:11:33,840<br>If you look at the one on the right, we can see that the packet has been broken down into</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:33,840 –&gt; 00:11:37,200<br>packets of length P. So I’ve broken that same message.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:37,200 –&gt; 00:11:39,080<br>It’s the same length as before.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:39,080 –&gt; 00:11:40,519<br>Overall, this is the message.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:40,519 –&gt; 00:11:42,560<br>But I’ve just broken down into packets of length P.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:42,560 –&gt; 00:11:46,639<br>So the packetization delay over the first link is P over R1.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:46,639 –&gt; 00:11:51,799<br>And so now on the end to end delay is this expression here, P over RRI for the packetization</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:51,799 –&gt; 00:11:58,240<br>delay on each link and then LI over C for the propagation delay.</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:58,240 –&gt; 00:12:04,559<br>M over P is simply the additional time for the one, the ones who are over the end.</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:04,559 –&gt; 00:12:08,599<br>Strictly speaking, this should be M minus 1 over P because it’s the remaining packets.</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:08,599 –&gt; 00:12:12,000<br>I’m going to assume that M is much bigger than P. So that’s basically the same.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:12,000 –&gt; 00:12:18,519<br>M over P times R3, the packetization delay of that packet, of that set of packets over</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:18,519 –&gt; 00:12:21,639<br>the last link.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:21,639 –&gt; 00:12:24,519<br>But the most important thing here is that you can see what’s going on.</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:24,519 –&gt; 00:12:29,240<br>In this case on the left, the whole message has to be transferred over the first link before</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:29,240 –&gt; 00:12:31,360<br>it can start on the second link.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:31,360 –&gt; 00:12:36,720<br>Whereas over here, the first packet goes and then is transferred under the second link,</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:36,720 –&gt; 00:12:39,759<br>while the first link is carrying the second packet.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:39,759 –&gt; 00:12:41,039<br>So we’ve got a pipelining effect.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:41,039 –&gt; 00:12:43,080<br>We’ve got parallelism over the links.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:43,080 –&gt; 00:12:46,159<br>And so therefore the end to end delay is going to be reduced.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:46,159 –&gt; 00:12:50,720<br>Over a long network with very big messages, this will make a very significant difference.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:50,720 –&gt; 00:12:58,080<br>And so the end to end delay can be reduced by making the packets smaller.</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:58,080 –&gt; 00:12:59,560<br>Let’s look at this simple example here.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:59,560 –&gt; 00:13:05,480<br>I’ve got a number of flows, N flows and packets coming in on, N external links, all running</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:05,480 –&gt; 00:13:06,639<br>at rate R.</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:06,639 –&gt; 00:13:11,639<br>I’ve got a packet buffer corresponding to the output queue of the router.</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:11,639 –&gt; 00:13:14,519<br>And then an outgoing link that’s running at rate R as well.</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:14,519 –&gt; 00:13:19,360<br>Clearly, if all of those ingress links were running at the full rate R, then the output</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:19,360 –&gt; 00:13:25,480<br>link would be overwhelmed and we’d start dropping packets very quickly.</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:25,480 –&gt; 00:13:30,720<br>And in fact, there would be a rate of N times R coming in and a rate of 1R going out.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:30,720 –&gt; 00:13:35,800<br>So we’ll be dropping them at a rate of N minus 1 times R.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:35,800 –&gt; 00:13:40,560<br>But because of the statistical model flexing and the burstiness of the arrivals, we can</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:40,560 –&gt; 00:13:46,159<br>potentially get away with this if the average rates are sufficiently low.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:46,159 –&gt; 00:13:53,159<br>So in general, we say the reduction in rate that we need at the egress compared to the</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:53,159 –&gt; 00:13:58,159<br>ingress is because of that statistical multiplexing and we call that benefit the statistical</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:58,159 –&gt; 00:13:59,759<br>multiplexing gain.</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:59,759 –&gt; 00:14:02,600<br>We never know what it’s going to be precisely because it’s going to depend on the particular</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:02,600 –&gt; 00:14:05,559<br>arrival process of packets.</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:05,559 –&gt; 00:14:10,600<br>And temporarily, if there are temporary over subscription to the output link, the buffer</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:10,600 –&gt; 00:14:13,159<br>can absorb those brief periods.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:13,159 –&gt; 00:14:17,439<br>And so a bigger buffer is going to absorb bigger and longer periods when the aggregate rate</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:17,439 –&gt; 00:14:19,679<br>happens to exceed R.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:19,679 –&gt; 00:14:24,199<br>But because the buffer has a finite size, there’s always losses that can occur and that’s</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:24,199 –&gt; 00:14:29,159<br>just a fact of life in packet switching, nothing that we can do about that.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:29,159 –&gt; 00:14:35,759<br>Let’s look at a couple of specific examples here.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:35,759 –&gt; 00:14:37,519<br>See the top here?</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:37,519 –&gt; 00:14:47,279<br>I’ve got a communicating arrival process, a into this router buffer that’s being drained</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:47,279 –&gt; 00:14:49,559<br>at rate c.</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:49,559 –&gt; 00:14:54,399<br>And a separate one that is going through a router that’s arriving at b at rate b and being</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:54,399 –&gt; 00:14:56,879<br>drained at rate c.</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:56,879 –&gt; 00:15:01,840<br>And I’m showing over here on the left hand side, the rates as a function of time.</p>
<p>212<br>00:15:01,840 –&gt; 00:15:05,439<br>And you can see here that the peaks and troughs don’t exactly line up.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:05,440 –&gt; 00:15:10,520<br>So that if we take the sum of the two or the sum of these two flows, then we can expect</p>
<p>214<br>00:15:10,520 –&gt; 00:15:12,520<br>there to be some statistical multiplexing gain.</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:12,520 –&gt; 00:15:15,440<br>Let’s have a look at what that might be.</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:15,440 –&gt; 00:15:19,800<br>Because I made up these numbers, these are just to give us an example.</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:19,800 –&gt; 00:15:24,880<br>But if we take a plus b here, it was the rate of a plus b.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:24,880 –&gt; 00:15:28,160<br>And that’s the line in pink, that’s this one here.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:28,160 –&gt; 00:15:34,200<br>You can see that the combined rate of the combined flows are.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:34,200 –&gt; 00:15:39,360<br>It’s quite a bit less than 2c, in other words, less than the sum of the two peaks.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:39,360 –&gt; 00:15:44,320<br>So in this case, we would say the statistical multiplexing gain equals 2c over r.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:44,320 –&gt; 00:15:48,120<br>It’s the benefit that we’re getting from summing the two of them.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:48,120 –&gt; 00:15:50,879<br>We can actually come up with a different definition.</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:50,879 –&gt; 00:15:55,360<br>And some people use a different definition for statistical multiplexing gain.</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:55,360 –&gt; 00:15:58,280<br>Because in this case, you can see we didn’t actually take advantage of the fact that there</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:58,280 –&gt; 00:15:59,360<br>is a buffer.</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:59,360 –&gt; 00:16:07,800<br>We’re not using that to buffer any temporary rate that exceeds r.</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:07,800 –&gt; 00:16:16,399<br>So one definition could be that for a given buffer size b, the ratio of the rates that we</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:16,399 –&gt; 00:16:19,840<br>need in order to prevent packet loss is the statistical multiplexing gain.</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:19,840 –&gt; 00:16:23,159<br>And that generally will be a lower rate, because we can absorb the change.</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:23,159 –&gt; 00:16:31,839<br>So for example, in this case, imagine that we were to serve at this rate r prime instead.</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:31,839 –&gt; 00:16:37,120<br>So we’ll call that r prime, where r prime is a little bit less than r.</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:37,120 –&gt; 00:16:43,199<br>So long as the amount that we need to buffer here and here when the rate exceeds r prime</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:43,199 –&gt; 00:16:46,480<br>can be accommodated by the buffer, then we’re okay.</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:46,480 –&gt; 00:16:51,959<br>And so in this case for the buffer of size b, we might say that instead the multiplexing</p>
<p>236<br>00:16:51,960 –&gt; 00:16:56,759<br>gain is to c over r prime, which is a slightly larger number.</p>
<p>237<br>00:16:56,759 –&gt; 00:17:00,960<br>Okay, so two definitions of statistical multiplexing gain, one where we don’t consider the</p>
<p>238<br>00:17:00,960 –&gt; 00:17:05,960<br>buffer and one where we do.</p>
<p>239<br>00:17:05,960 –&gt; 00:17:11,400<br>So in summary, often we can use a simple deterministic model of a queue to understand the packet dynamics</p>
<p>240<br>00:17:11,400 –&gt; 00:17:12,400<br>in a network.</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:12,400 –&gt; 00:17:13,400<br>And I’d encourage you to do this.</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:13,400 –&gt; 00:17:17,000<br>It gives a very good intuitive understanding of what’s happening in the network.</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:17,000 –&gt; 00:17:19,039<br>I often use this myself.</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:19,519 –&gt; 00:17:24,240<br>Second, we learn that we can break messages into packets or rather the reason that we break</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:24,240 –&gt; 00:17:28,319<br>messages into packets is because it lets us pipeline the transfer of packets from one</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:28,319 –&gt; 00:17:31,599<br>into another and reduces the end to end delay.</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:31,599 –&gt; 00:17:36,799<br>Finally, statistical multiplexing lets us carry many flows efficiently on a single link.</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:36,799 –&gt; 00:17:40,879<br>And this is one of the prime reasons that we use packet switching.</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:40,879 –&gt; 00:17:45,119<br>Okay, that’s the end of this video.</p>
