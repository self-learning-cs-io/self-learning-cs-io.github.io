                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,719<br>Continuing with our theme of packet switching, in this video I’m going to tell you about some</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,719 –&gt; 00:00:08,720<br>useful probators of cues. These are going to come in handy whenever we’re thinking about</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,720 –&gt; 00:00:14,320<br>how a cue evolves, how a packet buffer changes to affect the cueing delay of packets through</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,320 –&gt; 00:00:21,760<br>a network. As I was seen before, we can think of a network as a set of cues interconnected</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,760 –&gt; 00:00:26,560<br>by some links and those links are carrying the traffic or the packets for many many different</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:26,559 –&gt; 00:00:31,599<br>users and when multiplexed together, when statistically multiplexed together, that whole</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:31,599 –&gt; 00:00:37,839<br>process of packet arrivals is very, very complicated. We usually think of the arrival processes as</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:37,839 –&gt; 00:00:43,039<br>being random events. Each one was, of course, deterministically generated, but the aggregate we</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:43,039 –&gt; 00:00:50,560<br>can think of as a random process. It’s going to be good for us to understand how cues with random</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:50,560 –&gt; 00:00:56,079<br>arrival processes work. That’s going to be the topic that I’m going to be discussing today.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:56,079 –&gt; 00:01:01,039<br>Usually arrival processes are complicated in systems like networks, so we often model</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:01,039 –&gt; 00:01:06,480<br>them using random processes. This study of cues with random arrival processes is called</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:06,480 –&gt; 00:01:11,519<br>Cueing Theory. Cueing Theory you’ve probably heard of before has a reputation for having very</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:11,519 –&gt; 00:01:17,599<br>hairy mathematics. Despite that hairy mathematics, cues with random arrival processes have some</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:17,599 –&gt; 00:01:21,120<br>really interesting probators that are going to be good for us to understand. They’re going to</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:21,120 –&gt; 00:01:28,079<br>really help us understand the dynamics of networks. I’m going to go through a set of probators.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:28,079 –&gt; 00:01:33,520<br>I’m going to be starting with this one here that the burstiness tends to increase delay and it’s</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:33,520 –&gt; 00:01:39,439<br>at this level that I want you to remember these probators. The details and mathematics we’re</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:39,439 –&gt; 00:01:44,640<br>not going to worry about so much. I want you to understand these basic intuitive probators of</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:44,640 –&gt; 00:01:50,880<br>Cueing Systems. It all comes down to the way that the cue evolves. I’m going to just sketch here</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:51,520 –&gt; 00:01:57,840<br>my cue again. This is the arrivals to the cue of our packets. You’ll hear people call customers</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:57,840 –&gt; 00:02:02,960<br>as well because Cueing Theory applies to many other systems. If I say customers, I mean packets</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:02,960 –&gt; 00:02:07,920<br>in this context. This is our arrivals. These are our departures. We’re going to be thinking about</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:07,920 –&gt; 00:02:15,840<br>the evolution of the cue occupancy, cue of T, cue as a function of time. On this timeline down here,</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:15,840 –&gt; 00:02:21,039<br>I’ve drawn a sequence of arrivals and departures. Packet arrivals happening at these blue</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:21,039 –&gt; 00:02:26,000<br>downward arrows, representing the time or the epoch of the arrival, and then these red up what</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:26,000 –&gt; 00:02:32,159<br>arrow is being the departures, the times at which the cue was serviced. Just like in many cues</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:32,159 –&gt; 00:02:38,879<br>for networks, we’re going to think of this as representing a link of a fixed rate R,</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:38,879 –&gt; 00:02:47,039<br>which means that the interdeparture opportunities are at one over R apart. Now let’s look at the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:47,039 –&gt; 00:02:53,039<br>evolution of the cue. The cue here has the first arrival, the blue one, which takes it up the one,</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:53,039 –&gt; 00:02:57,199<br>and then we have the service that the output red arrow, which is going to take us to zero. There’s</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:57,199 –&gt; 00:03:00,960<br>a new arrival, which is going to take us back to one again. Then there’s this departure here,</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:00,960 –&gt; 00:03:05,919<br>which is going to take us to zero, then back up to one again, then zero, etc. At this point here,</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:05,919 –&gt; 00:03:10,399<br>we’ve had two arrivals in a row, which is going to take us back to a cue occupancy of two,</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:10,959 –&gt; 00:03:18,159<br>and so on. This is going to be the evolution of the cue. Now let’s look at this one here,</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:18,159 –&gt; 00:03:24,719<br>this departure opportunity. The reason I’ve drawn this is a dotted line. This is sometimes people</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:24,719 –&gt; 00:03:29,039<br>call this a shadow departure. It was a departure opportunity when we could have set a packet,</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:29,039 –&gt; 00:03:33,919<br>but the cue was empty, so that we never actually sent the packet, because we can’t actually go down</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:33,919 –&gt; 00:03:40,639<br>to a negative cue occupancy. That wouldn’t be possible. The cue sticks at zero, even though we missed</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:40,639 –&gt; 00:03:45,919<br>this opportunity. It’s going to turn out that these missed opportunities are quite important.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:45,919 –&gt; 00:03:51,519<br>You can’t have a negative cue occupancy, so some people say you don’t get credit for good behavior</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:51,519 –&gt; 00:03:57,759<br>by not having an arrival during this interval here. It meant that the cue occupancy stuck at zero,</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:57,840 –&gt; 00:04:05,679<br>but we’re not going to credit for it. If we have random arrivals with arrivals that are spread out,</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:05,679 –&gt; 00:04:11,280<br>if we miss an opportunity to send, it’s tough. We never get that back again. Let’s now take a look at</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:11,280 –&gt; 00:04:18,719<br>the first property I wanted to explain. That is that burstiness or bursty arrivals tend to increase</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:18,719 –&gt; 00:04:25,920<br>delay. To start with a very simple example where there is no burstiness, where we have the simplest</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:25,920 –&gt; 00:04:33,280<br>arrival process, which is a sequence of arrivals, all exactly one second apart. This is one packet per</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:33,280 –&gt; 00:04:40,160<br>second, and in fact it’s one packet exactly every second. Nothing random about this at all. Let’s</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:40,160 –&gt; 00:04:46,160<br>look at the sequence of departures. I’m going to assume that there is one departure every second.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:46,160 –&gt; 00:04:52,000<br>If we were to sketch the cue occupancy here, I won’t sketch the graph, I’ll just put the numbers in.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:52,000 –&gt; 00:04:58,480<br>If we were to sample the occupancy here, there’d be an arrival but no departure, so we’d have one,</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:58,480 –&gt; 00:05:05,439<br>and then zero, and then it’s one again, and then zero, one, zero. There’s the way I’ve drawn it here.</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:05,439 –&gt; 00:05:11,040<br>There are long periods of zero, and then the short periods of one when there’s been arrival but no</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:11,040 –&gt; 00:05:16,399<br>departure. Of course, I could shift either the arrivals at a departure and make those of zeroes and</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:16,399 –&gt; 00:05:21,600<br>ones be of different durations. That’ll just carry on because there are things nice and</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:21,600 –&gt; 00:05:28,080<br>periodic. The interesting thing to note here is, Q of T, the cue occupancy, is either zero or one,</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:28,080 –&gt; 00:05:33,680<br>so we can say it’s always less than or equal to one. The average cue occupancy is going to be</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:33,680 –&gt; 00:05:38,640<br>some way between zero and one. We know that for sure, just because of the structure of the problem.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:38,640 –&gt; 00:05:44,560<br>So periodic arrivals make for a nice, simple understanding of that cue evolution. Now let’s look</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:44,560 –&gt; 00:05:50,879<br>at a different example when things are more bursty. Just as before, the arrivals are going to be</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:50,879 –&gt; 00:05:56,480<br>at the rate of one per second, but they’re going to arrive in bursts. In fact, we’re going to have</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:56,480 –&gt; 00:06:05,360<br>n arrivals, when we have n arrivals, n arrivals, every n seconds. So n packets every n seconds,</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:05,360 –&gt; 00:06:10,000<br>but they’re going to come in these bursts of n. In this particular case, it’s five packets every five</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:10,000 –&gt; 00:06:17,439<br>seconds. The service opportunity is, although the departure is going to be the same as before,</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:17,439 –&gt; 00:06:22,959<br>we’re going to have one per second. So in terms of the rates, the arrival rate and the departure</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:22,959 –&gt; 00:06:27,519<br>rate, everything is exactly the same as before. It’s one packet per second. It’s just that the</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:27,519 –&gt; 00:06:31,920<br>burstiness of the arrivals is going to change things and let’s look at the way in which they</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:31,920 –&gt; 00:06:39,519<br>change. So here we’ve got a sudden burst of arrivals of five. So depending on whether, when we</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:39,519 –&gt; 00:06:46,240<br>sample it, sample the cue occupancy, we’re going to have Q of T equals zero all the way through to</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:46,240 –&gt; 00:06:52,400<br>five, depending on when we sample. During this time here, it’s four, then three, then two, then</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:52,400 –&gt; 00:06:58,240<br>one, then zero, and then it’s going to go up to five again sometime in here and four, and so on,</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:58,240 –&gt; 00:07:05,199<br>and so on and so on. Okay? So before our cue occupancy was zero or one, but now even with the same</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:05,199 –&gt; 00:07:10,400<br>arrival rate and even with the same departure rate, our cue occupancy can go between zero and five.</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:10,399 –&gt; 00:07:16,719<br>So our arrival, our average cue occupancy is higher and the variance of the cue occupancy is higher</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:16,719 –&gt; 00:07:23,199<br>too because it’s varying all the way across zero to five. So average and the variance have both</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:23,199 –&gt; 00:07:27,679<br>increased even though the rate hasn’t changed. So clearly the burstiness is going to make a big</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:27,679 –&gt; 00:07:33,759<br>big difference. And in general, we say burstiness increases delay and that simple example illustrates</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:33,759 –&gt; 00:07:38,560<br>it. It doesn’t prove it, but hopefully it gives you intuition as to why burstiness will increase</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:38,560 –&gt; 00:07:43,280<br>delay. The second property, which is very similar to the first, it’s almost the</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:44,079 –&gt; 00:07:47,839<br>the counterbalance of the first, is that determinism tends to minimize delay.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:49,600 –&gt; 00:07:54,560<br>But it’s enough for us to know that in general, determinism minimizes delay. In other words, random</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:54,560 –&gt; 00:08:01,279<br>arrivals wait longer on average than simple periodic arrivals. Okay, let me move on to the third</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:01,279 –&gt; 00:08:06,000<br>property I’d like you to know about and that is a well-known result called littles result.</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:06,959 –&gt; 00:08:14,079<br>Cue is very complicated and as you’ve, as I’ve already given you an indication, the mathematics tends</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:14,079 –&gt; 00:08:19,120<br>to get very hairy. But there are some simple results that you really need to know and it’s important</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:19,120 –&gt; 00:08:24,560<br>first to understand because they’re going to come in handy when we’re understanding the basic</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:24,560 –&gt; 00:08:31,519<br>properties of Cue’s. And this one littles the result is deceptively simple. So in any cueing system</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:31,519 –&gt; 00:08:40,799<br>like the one shown here, there’s a following property which is a little surprising. If I’ve got a</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:40,799 –&gt; 00:08:51,199<br>well-defined arrival rate, let’s call that lambda. And I’ve got an average number of cues in the</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:51,199 –&gt; 00:09:01,120<br>system L. And I want to know what the average delay is and I’m going to call this d equals average</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:01,120 –&gt; 00:09:12,720<br>delay of a customer or a packet through the cue. Then littles result tells us that there is in general</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:12,720 –&gt; 00:09:20,480<br>the number of customers in the system equals the average arrival rate times the average delay</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:20,480 –&gt; 00:09:27,919<br>of a customer through the cue. That’s it. This deceptively simple result applies for any cueing system</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:28,399 –&gt; 00:09:36,079<br>for which there are no customers that are lost or dropped. So if none, lost or dropped.</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:41,039 –&gt; 00:09:46,240<br>So it doesn’t matter what the arrival process is. It doesn’t matter how bursty, how non-bursty.</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:46,240 –&gt; 00:09:51,279<br>So long as it has a well-defined arrival rate lambda, then we can make this calculation.</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:52,159 –&gt; 00:09:55,360<br>So you can go to any cue and we’ll look at some examples in a moment.</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:57,279 –&gt; 00:10:01,279<br>And you can calculate the average number in the cue as a function of the arrival rate and the</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:01,279 –&gt; 00:10:05,919<br>average delay. Or of course if you know L and lambda, then you can figure out the average delay</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:05,919 –&gt; 00:10:13,439<br>that’s going to be seen by a customer through this cue. Now L is the average number that are in the</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:13,439 –&gt; 00:10:20,159<br>cue plus currently being serviced. So long as d is the average delay of customers that arrive</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:20,159 –&gt; 00:10:27,919<br>until they’ve completed service. Turns out this result also holds if we say L is the average time,</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:27,919 –&gt; 00:10:33,679<br>sorry, the average number of customers in just the cue but not yet entering service. So long as d</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:33,679 –&gt; 00:10:39,199<br>also equals the average delay through the cue prior to entering service. So both of those are true.</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:41,759 –&gt; 00:10:44,879<br>We’re going to be using this result quite a lot throughout the quarter.</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:45,600 –&gt; 00:10:53,120<br>Having told you about those three probators of cues, something I need to tell you before we</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:53,120 –&gt; 00:10:58,159<br>get on to the fourth property. And that is the Poisson process. You’re going to hear a lot about the</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:58,159 –&gt; 00:11:05,679<br>Poisson process whenever you study cues or any complicated system that we model probabilistically.</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:06,320 –&gt; 00:11:09,840<br>You know, a physical can tell you what the Poisson process is. Then I’m going to tell you why it’s</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:09,840 –&gt; 00:11:16,800<br>interesting and some caveats about using it. So the Poisson process is an arrival process in our case</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:17,440 –&gt; 00:11:24,480<br>and an arrival process we say is Poisson if, in fact, an only if, the probability of there being</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:24,480 –&gt; 00:11:29,920<br>k arrivals in an interval of t seconds is given by this expression here, kind of a hairy expression.</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:29,920 –&gt; 00:11:37,280<br>But the important thing is that that we can express this as the expected number of arrivals within</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:37,279 –&gt; 00:11:41,279<br>an interval t is simply lambda t where lambda is the arrival rate.</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:44,480 –&gt; 00:11:50,399<br>Also, successive inter arrival times are independence. What this means is that once we’ve picked one</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:50,399 –&gt; 00:11:57,439<br>arrival from this expression here, this will lead to an arrival event happening. Then the next</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:57,439 –&gt; 00:12:02,079<br>arrival is independent of the first one. And in fact, if we take a sliding window and move that over</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:02,080 –&gt; 00:12:08,160<br>the arrival process within any period, the inter arrival times within one period are independent</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:08,160 –&gt; 00:12:12,720<br>of the next. That means that there’s no burst in S or coupling of one arrival to another.</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:13,600 –&gt; 00:12:17,840<br>Okay, that’s what the Poisson process is. If you pick up any book on probability,</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:17,840 –&gt; 00:12:22,320<br>then you can find a more detailed description if that’s something that’s new to you.</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:23,120 –&gt; 00:12:28,480<br>So why the Poisson process? Why are we interested in the Poisson process? Well, the Poisson process</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:28,480 –&gt; 00:12:33,759<br>happens to model an aggregation of many independent random events very well.</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:34,639 –&gt; 00:12:41,600<br>For example, it’s used in models of new funcals arriving to a switch. So when we have a telephone</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:41,600 –&gt; 00:12:47,519<br>switch and we say we want to model the arrival of a new funcule that is being placed through the day,</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:47,519 –&gt; 00:12:53,680<br>then a Poisson process is a very good model of this. Or the decay of many independent nuclear</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:53,679 –&gt; 00:12:59,359<br>particles where we have a huge number of particles, all operating independently of each other.</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:59,359 –&gt; 00:13:05,839<br>They will decay at certain times that decay as a aggregation of many random events tends to</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:05,839 –&gt; 00:13:10,559<br>a Poisson process as we have a large number of particles. And you may also be familiar with</p>
<p>130<br>00:13:10,559 –&gt; 00:13:14,799<br>shot noise in an electrical circuit, which is also modeled as a Poisson process.</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:15,439 –&gt; 00:13:19,679<br>The final thing, despite the complexity of the equation on the on the on the previous slide,</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:19,679 –&gt; 00:13:25,759<br>it actually makes the math very easy. And this is a big reason that it gets used very widely as well.</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:27,919 –&gt; 00:13:34,000<br>At this point, I should give you some warnings. Network traffic is very bursty. There’s nothing,</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:34,000 –&gt; 00:13:39,919<br>nothing independent about one packet arrival after another. As we will see later packets tend</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:39,919 –&gt; 00:13:45,120<br>very frequently to arrive in bursts. And many things in the network help actually to keep them</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:45,120 –&gt; 00:13:51,200<br>that way and make them very bursty. So packet arrivals are not, and I can’t overemphasize this,</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:51,200 –&gt; 00:13:55,600<br>they are not Poisson. There’s been some classic papers, research papers that have shown this.</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:56,320 –&gt; 00:14:03,440<br>However, it does model quite well the arrival of new flows of new communications. For example,</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:03,440 –&gt; 00:14:09,919<br>the inter-arrival times of web requests or sending emails. For anyone individual, they may be</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:09,919 –&gt; 00:14:14,879<br>somewhat Poisson, but when you take the aggregation of many users putting their network traffic into</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:14,879 –&gt; 00:14:21,759<br>the network, that is actually modeled quite well by a Poisson process. And sometimes, sometimes we</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:21,759 –&gt; 00:14:27,519<br>can use some of the results that apply to queues with Poisson arrivals to give us an intuition</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:27,519 –&gt; 00:14:32,879<br>and understanding of maybe what’s happening even at the packet level, but we must do that very, very carefully.</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:36,480 –&gt; 00:14:41,039<br>Let’s look at a very common example of why we use the Poisson process. This is something called the</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:41,039 –&gt; 00:14:48,719<br>MM1Q. The MM1Q is about the simplest type of queue that is commonly analyzed. The notation is that</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:49,279 –&gt; 00:14:57,919<br>the M stands for a macovian arrival process, which in our case is Poisson. Macovian service process,</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:57,919 –&gt; 00:15:04,639<br>which is exponential in our case, which means that the time that it takes to service a packet is</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:04,639 –&gt; 00:15:10,720<br>exponentially distributed, and each one has a service time independent of all of the others,</p>
<p>149<br>00:15:11,279 –&gt; 00:15:15,679<br>and that there is one server, in other words, that there’s one outgoing line servicing this queue.</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:16,799 –&gt; 00:15:22,879<br>This is very widely used, because it assumes a nice simple Poisson arrival with independent</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:22,879 –&gt; 00:15:30,159<br>arrivals from one packet to the next. But it’s also used because the math is nice and simple,</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:30,159 –&gt; 00:15:36,879<br>and the result is very intuitive. So if we would have analyzed this and we can analyze it using</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:38,639 –&gt; 00:15:41,519<br>continuous time macov chains, we will discover that the</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:42,959 –&gt; 00:15:47,759<br>average delay of a packet going through this queue is given by the simple expression,</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:47,759 –&gt; 00:15:57,360<br>one over mu minus lambda. What this tells us is that it’s one over the difference between the</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:57,360 –&gt; 00:16:02,399<br>service rate and the arrival rate. So as the load increases and the load gets closer and closer</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:02,399 –&gt; 00:16:06,800<br>to the service rate, then this number will grow very rapidly. And if we plot this on a graph,</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:07,919 –&gt; 00:16:17,279<br>so as a function of lambda over mu, so that’s lambda over mu, as we get closer and closer to one,</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:17,279 –&gt; 00:16:22,960<br>in other words, where they’re equal, the average delay of a packet through this queue will</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:23,600 –&gt; 00:16:30,240<br>increase very, very steeply. And this is the case for almost any queueing system, not just the</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:30,240 –&gt; 00:16:36,480<br>MM1 queue. The reason that we use the MM1 queue sometimes as a placeholder for a more complicated</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:36,480 –&gt; 00:16:41,280<br>system is only that the math is simpler and this expression is simple, but you see a very similar</p>
<p>163<br>00:16:41,280 –&gt; 00:16:48,000<br>shape for almost any queueing system. We can use little’s result to figure out what the average queue</p>
<p>164<br>00:16:48,080 –&gt; 00:16:56,000<br>occupancy is and we know that L equals lambda times D, which in this case is simply going to be</p>
<p>165<br>00:16:56,879 –&gt; 00:17:04,400<br>lambda over mu divided by one minus lambda over mu. The reason for writing it in terms of lambda</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:04,400 –&gt; 00:17:10,079<br>over mu is simply that lambda over mu represents the intensity just as I sketched on the graph here.</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:11,200 –&gt; 00:17:17,119<br>As lambda approaches mu, lambda over mu approaches one and the denominator turns to zero and the</p>
<p>168<br>00:17:17,199 –&gt; 00:17:23,279<br>queue occupancy and the average delay will blow up and tend towards infinity. So the MM1 queue</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:23,279 –&gt; 00:17:29,359<br>provides us a good intuition. Don’t ever assume that this is the actual representative measure of</p>
<p>170<br>00:17:30,079 –&gt; 00:17:35,199<br>the queue occupancy or the average delay, but it can often help to give it an intuitive sense of</p>
<p>171<br>00:17:35,199 –&gt; 00:17:42,879<br>what’s going on in a network. So in summary, the main queue properties I want you to take away from</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:42,880 –&gt; 00:17:48,640<br>this video are that burstiness tends to increase delay. So bursty arrivals tend to make queuing</p>
<p>173<br>00:17:48,640 –&gt; 00:17:54,800<br>delays longer. Little’s result gives us a nice relationship between the average occupancy of a queue,</p>
<p>174<br>00:17:54,800 –&gt; 00:17:59,920<br>L, lambda the arrival rate and D, the average delay of a customer through that queue.</p>
<p>175<br>00:18:00,960 –&gt; 00:18:07,520<br>While packet arrivals are not Poisson, some events are such as web requests and new flow arrivals.</p>
<p>176<br>00:18:07,519 –&gt; 00:18:12,639<br>And Poisson process also forms the basis of the MM1 queue, which is a simple queuing model that</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:12,639 –&gt; 00:18:18,639<br>often can give us some intuition about the delay properties of a network. That’s the end of this video.</p>
