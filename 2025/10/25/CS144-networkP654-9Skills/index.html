                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,100<br>So this video is about how to read an RFC or a quest for comments, the standards document</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,100 –&gt; 00:00:07,560<br>of the ITO of the internet.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:07,560 –&gt; 00:00:11,839<br>So reading RFC is critical if you want to get a deeper understanding of how the internet</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:11,839 –&gt; 00:00:16,300<br>works, how its protocols are specified, but there are documents that have evolved over</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:16,300 –&gt; 00:00:19,600<br>several decades to have certain structures and certain approaches in this video is going</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:19,600 –&gt; 00:00:23,039<br>to explain what that looks like and why.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:23,039 –&gt; 00:00:29,320<br>There’s actually an RFC or a quest for comments, a 2500 555 which describes the history of RFC,</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:29,320 –&gt; 00:00:31,620<br>sort of a historical retrospective.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:31,620 –&gt; 00:00:36,700<br>The first RFC, RFC1, was entitled Host Software.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:36,700 –&gt; 00:00:41,719<br>And this quote from RFC1 talks about where that name came from, the idea that these documents</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:41,719 –&gt; 00:00:47,659<br>aren’t statements of control or assertion of control would rather part of a dialogue.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:47,659 –&gt; 00:00:52,840<br>And while RFCs today are a bit more formal than this first one, some thoughts on how to</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:52,840 –&gt; 00:00:56,200<br>structure host software, that still remains.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:56,200 –&gt; 00:01:01,240<br>There’s nobody who enforces RFCs rather their statements of a group of people about what</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:01,240 –&gt; 00:01:02,800<br>you need to do to interoperate.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:02,800 –&gt; 00:01:06,200<br>You can always write things that don’t follow RFCs, but if you want to interoperate, this</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:06,200 –&gt; 00:01:08,200<br>is what you do need to do.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:08,200 –&gt; 00:01:16,240<br>So over time, RFCs came to have a standardized format, so there’s the structure of the document,</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:16,240 –&gt; 00:01:21,120<br>concerns of intellectual property, and also specific terms that RFCs use.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:21,120 –&gt; 00:01:25,200<br>Often you see them in capital words that have very, capital letters of very specific meaning,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:25,200 –&gt; 00:01:29,400<br>or all defined at RFC 2119.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:29,400 –&gt; 00:01:34,799<br>Modern RFCs, for example, always have or required to have two sections, security considerations</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:34,799 –&gt; 00:01:36,760<br>and considerations for IANA.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:36,760 –&gt; 00:01:38,640<br>So security has obvious reasons.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:38,640 –&gt; 00:01:44,760<br>IANA is if this RFC needs new value registries, say, a protocol field or whether it allocates</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:44,760 –&gt; 00:01:48,760<br>fields in other protocols.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:48,760 –&gt; 00:01:52,840<br>Now one thing that often a first-time reader doesn’t quite realize, and it can be a bit</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:52,840 –&gt; 00:01:56,760<br>confusing, is that there are actually multiple types of RFCs.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:56,760 –&gt; 00:02:00,359<br>And they actually have very different meanings and very different implications towards the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:00,359 –&gt; 00:02:02,840<br>standards process of the internet.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:02,840 –&gt; 00:02:07,439<br>So for example, there are proposed standards, standards track, informational, experimental</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:07,439 –&gt; 00:02:08,439<br>and best-current practice.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:08,439 –&gt; 00:02:13,400<br>And the way to think of those is that there’s a spectrum of whether or not there’s an idea,</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:13,400 –&gt; 00:02:20,159<br>a couple of people have proposed, say, experimental, whether or not it’s a specification, or it’s</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:20,159 –&gt; 00:02:24,599<br>simply some valuable information that’s an informational RFC can be not a protocol, but</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:24,599 –&gt; 00:02:28,199<br>rather a valuable information for the community.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:28,199 –&gt; 00:02:29,879<br>Then you have proposed standards.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:29,879 –&gt; 00:02:34,519<br>So here’s something which a group of people believe should become a common standard of</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:34,519 –&gt; 00:02:37,079<br>the internet, and then standards track.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:37,079 –&gt; 00:02:42,159<br>And the transition between proposed standards and standards track, or standards track is further</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:42,159 –&gt; 00:02:47,519<br>along the process towards becoming a really stable standard of the internet, has to do with</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:47,520 –&gt; 00:02:51,159<br>how many implementations there are, whether they can interoperate, and there’s some formal</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:51,159 –&gt; 00:02:53,640<br>process for making the transition.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:53,640 –&gt; 00:02:58,520<br>There are also RFCs that are best-current practice, which are based on our current knowledge</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:58,520 –&gt; 00:02:59,520<br>today.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:59,520 –&gt; 00:03:01,760<br>These are the things that you really want to do best practice.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:01,760 –&gt; 00:03:02,760<br>Best practices.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:02,760 –&gt; 00:03:07,760<br>So for example, there are best-current practices about how to implement TCP and its congestion</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:07,760 –&gt; 00:03:10,160<br>control algorithms.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:10,160 –&gt; 00:03:13,200<br>So that’s what an RFC looks like.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:13,199 –&gt; 00:03:18,039<br>This is the basic process that an RFC takes, or a document takes to create an RFC.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:18,039 –&gt; 00:03:24,560<br>This is a bit simplified, and this is actually my personal experience when working on the</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:24,560 –&gt; 00:03:29,560<br>RFC for this algorithm that came out of my research trickle.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:29,560 –&gt; 00:03:32,879<br>So generally what happens is that the document starts as a draft.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:32,879 –&gt; 00:03:36,759<br>And so when you see documents in the ITF named draft, they are not RFCs.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:36,759 –&gt; 00:03:39,599<br>They are not formal documents.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:39,599 –&gt; 00:03:44,120<br>Instead, they are works in progress, and correspondingly they actually time out, so people don’t update</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:44,120 –&gt; 00:03:45,120<br>the draft.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:45,120 –&gt; 00:03:47,719<br>Eventually, it disappears off the ITF servers.</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:47,719 –&gt; 00:03:48,799<br>And so you start with the draft.</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:48,799 –&gt; 00:03:51,280<br>I mean, you notice that it’s draft-levels.</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:51,280 –&gt; 00:03:52,879<br>This means that it’s a personal draft.</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:52,879 –&gt; 00:03:57,120<br>It’s a private, it’s a personal submission that somebody, just a person, or maybe a few</p>
<p>64<br>00:03:57,120 –&gt; 00:04:02,039<br>people, are suggesting this document might be of interest to the internet.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:02,039 –&gt; 00:04:03,039<br>And then there’s some information.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:03,039 –&gt; 00:04:05,479<br>In this case, levels, that’s me.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:05,479 –&gt; 00:04:10,319<br>Levels was the ITF working group that it was the draft was being proposed for, the routing</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:10,319 –&gt; 00:04:12,239<br>over low power and lossy links.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:12,239 –&gt; 00:04:15,280<br>And then a descriptive name, trickle, the trickle algorithm, and then a number.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:15,280 –&gt; 00:04:20,199<br>So this is version zero of this draft, so the first version of it.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:20,199 –&gt; 00:04:24,240<br>Then you can submit that to a working group for some consideration discussion.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:24,240 –&gt; 00:04:28,560<br>Maybe it iterates a couple of times, you make some improvements, some modifications, and</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:28,560 –&gt; 00:04:33,560<br>the numbers increment, so trickle zero zero, trickle zero one, trickle zero two.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:33,560 –&gt; 00:04:38,720<br>And at some point, the chair of a working group can say, or ask the working group, do</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:38,720 –&gt; 00:04:42,720<br>we think that this is something which should become a working group work item?</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:42,720 –&gt; 00:04:48,720<br>Is this a document or an idea or a protocol, which the working group thinks as part of</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:48,720 –&gt; 00:04:52,959<br>its charter and should make more formal?</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:52,959 –&gt; 00:04:57,519<br>When it becomes a working group document, then the name changes from draft someone’s name,</p>
<p>79<br>00:04:57,519 –&gt; 00:05:02,279<br>draft levels, to draft ITF, to show that this is now a document under the full auspices</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:02,279 –&gt; 00:05:03,319<br>of a working group.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:03,319 –&gt; 00:05:05,480<br>And you can see that it’s still the role working group.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:05,480 –&gt; 00:05:09,040<br>At this point, the version number resets to zero zero.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:09,040 –&gt; 00:05:10,680<br>Then it goes through revisions.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:10,680 –&gt; 00:05:12,800<br>You presented at working group meetings.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:12,800 –&gt; 00:05:17,399<br>You get feedback, comments on the mailing lists, questions, concerns.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:17,399 –&gt; 00:05:22,039<br>The document iterates over versions, zero ones, zero two, zero three.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:22,039 –&gt; 00:05:27,439<br>At some point, the working group chair, one of the working group chairs, they decide that</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:27,439 –&gt; 00:05:31,240<br>the document is ready for publication.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:32,240 –&gt; 00:05:34,639<br>And so the working group chair can say, look, I feel like this document has been through</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:34,639 –&gt; 00:05:35,639<br>a lot of revision.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:35,639 –&gt; 00:05:36,639<br>We agree.</p>
<p>92<br>00:05:36,639 –&gt; 00:05:37,639<br>It seems like it’s a good position.</p>
<p>93<br>00:05:37,639 –&gt; 00:05:40,040<br>It’s something that’s part of the working group’s work.</p>
<p>94<br>00:05:40,040 –&gt; 00:05:42,360<br>We want to make this an RFC.</p>
<p>95<br>00:05:42,360 –&gt; 00:05:44,840<br>At that point, there’s a last call issued.</p>
<p>96<br>00:05:44,840 –&gt; 00:05:46,639<br>First, the working group and then to the ITF.</p>
<p>97<br>00:05:46,639 –&gt; 00:05:50,519<br>So the working group is given a chance, a period to respond, any final comments to improve</p>
<p>98<br>00:05:50,519 –&gt; 00:05:52,120<br>the document.</p>
<p>99<br>00:05:52,120 –&gt; 00:05:55,240<br>After which, then, it’s given a last call to the entire ITF.</p>
<p>100<br>00:05:55,240 –&gt; 00:05:59,519<br>Anyone can comment on it and suggest things to improve it.</p>
<p>101<br>00:05:59,519 –&gt; 00:06:03,759<br>After it’s passed to those last calls, that is, all of the issues that people have seen</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:03,759 –&gt; 00:06:07,680<br>have been addressed to the satisfaction of the working group chair.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:07,680 –&gt; 00:06:11,199<br>It goes to the IESG, the steering group, the internet engineering steering group, which</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:11,199 –&gt; 00:06:14,560<br>has representatives from all of the major areas of the internet.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:14,560 –&gt; 00:06:16,159<br>So you have both tremendous depth.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:16,159 –&gt; 00:06:21,359<br>People who say experts in transport, experts in real-time application infrastructure.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:21,359 –&gt; 00:06:25,199<br>But then, because it’s all of the experts, it also has tremendous breadth.</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:25,199 –&gt; 00:06:31,759<br>Everything from the network to operations to transport.</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:31,759 –&gt; 00:06:34,959<br>The IESG reviews it, gives feedback, gives comments.</p>
<p>110<br>00:06:34,959 –&gt; 00:06:37,519<br>Sometimes they refuse to publish it as an RFC.</p>
<p>111<br>00:06:37,519 –&gt; 00:06:41,599<br>They say that this is not, this has substantive issues, which we see.</p>
<p>112<br>00:06:41,599 –&gt; 00:06:44,480<br>You need to completely rework it.</p>
<p>113<br>00:06:44,480 –&gt; 00:06:48,240<br>But if things go well, the IESG gives some comments to address those comments, and then the</p>
<p>114<br>00:06:48,240 –&gt; 00:06:51,079<br>document is approved as an RFC.</p>
<p>115<br>00:06:51,079 –&gt; 00:06:53,560<br>Request for comments.</p>
<p>116<br>00:06:53,560 –&gt; 00:07:01,319<br>So as described in RFC 2119, there are certain terms which are used in RFCs, which have very</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:01,319 –&gt; 00:07:06,040<br>specific meanings with respect to interoperability and proposed standards.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:06,040 –&gt; 00:07:09,920<br>So these are those terms, and when they’re used, they’re used in all caps.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:09,920 –&gt; 00:07:12,680<br>So the first is must required in shall.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:12,680 –&gt; 00:07:16,600<br>If you see this term used in an RFC, then this is an absolute requirement.</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:16,600 –&gt; 00:07:23,120<br>If a protocol or an implementation does not follow this statement, then it does not follow</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:23,120 –&gt; 00:07:24,120<br>the RFC.</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:24,120 –&gt; 00:07:25,720<br>It is not compliant.</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:25,720 –&gt; 00:07:27,959<br>Then there should recommend it.</p>
<p>125<br>00:07:27,959 –&gt; 00:07:31,720<br>And so that shouldn’t recommend it or things you really generally want to do.</p>
<p>126<br>00:07:31,720 –&gt; 00:07:35,399<br>It’s really advised that you do it, but it’s understood that there might be times when</p>
<p>127<br>00:07:35,399 –&gt; 00:07:37,079<br>you don’t for whatever reason.</p>
<p>128<br>00:07:37,079 –&gt; 00:07:44,079<br>And so the terminology that’s used in 2119 is that you really should understand the implications</p>
<p>129<br>00:07:44,079 –&gt; 00:07:47,600<br>of not doing this if you’re going to choose to not do it.</p>
<p>130<br>00:07:47,600 –&gt; 00:07:49,280<br>And then finally, there’s may optional.</p>
<p>131<br>00:07:49,280 –&gt; 00:07:51,600<br>And so this is totally up to you.</p>
<p>132<br>00:07:51,600 –&gt; 00:07:52,600<br>You can do it.</p>
<p>133<br>00:07:52,600 –&gt; 00:07:53,600<br>You cannot do it.</p>
<p>134<br>00:07:53,600 –&gt; 00:07:57,080<br>It is not required for interoperability in any way.</p>
<p>135<br>00:07:57,080 –&gt; 00:07:59,840<br>And so when you read an RFC, it’s important to see these terms and how they’re used and</p>
<p>136<br>00:07:59,840 –&gt; 00:08:04,560<br>then understand what the RFC is really saying you have to do to be compliant.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:04,560 –&gt; 00:08:09,080<br>So I thought as an example, we could walk through RFC 5681.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:09,080 –&gt; 00:08:10,760<br>This is TCP congestion control.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:10,760 –&gt; 00:08:14,200<br>As you can see, it’s standards track.</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:14,200 –&gt; 00:08:15,520<br>So this is pretty well along.</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:15,520 –&gt; 00:08:21,280<br>It is written back in 2009 by a bunch of folks who are bigwigs in the internet.</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:22,079 –&gt; 00:08:29,479<br>And so one thing you can see is, in fact, the history of this document in terms of drafts.</p>
<p>143<br>00:08:29,479 –&gt; 00:08:31,919<br>So it was draft IATF.</p>
<p>144<br>00:08:31,919 –&gt; 00:08:33,559<br>And it went through all of these revisions.</p>
<p>145<br>00:08:33,559 –&gt; 00:08:35,120<br>And you can see what the revisions are.</p>
<p>146<br>00:08:35,120 –&gt; 00:08:38,079<br>The earlier vision that this is what this obsolete is 2581.</p>
<p>147<br>00:08:38,079 –&gt; 00:08:42,039<br>And so this particular RATF draft went through seven revisions before becoming an RFC.</p>
<p>148<br>00:08:42,039 –&gt; 00:08:45,039<br>So let’s go back to the RFC.</p>
<p>149<br>00:08:45,039 –&gt; 00:08:48,360<br>So as you can see, there’s an abstract sort of stating what it’s about.</p>
<p>150<br>00:08:48,360 –&gt; 00:08:54,519<br>So you can see the copyright notice, but intellectual property, some background.</p>
<p>151<br>00:08:54,519 –&gt; 00:08:57,440<br>It defines a bunch of terms which are used in this.</p>
<p>152<br>00:08:57,440 –&gt; 00:09:04,240<br>But if we jump forward, so here, say in section three, it’s defining the congestion control</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:04,240 –&gt; 00:09:06,680<br>algorithms of TCP.</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:06,680 –&gt; 00:09:10,960<br>So start congestion avoidance, faster transmit and fast recovery.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:10,960 –&gt; 00:09:17,480<br>And so you know it, for example, one of the first requirements this document states is that</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:17,480 –&gt; 00:09:23,519<br>it’s okay for TCP senders to send more slowly than what these algorithms say in order to back</p>
<p>157<br>00:09:23,519 –&gt; 00:09:27,840<br>off more aggressively to congestion, but it must not be more aggressive.</p>
<p>158<br>00:09:27,840 –&gt; 00:09:32,560<br>That these, what this document describes are basically the upper bounds of what TCP should</p>
<p>159<br>00:09:32,560 –&gt; 00:09:33,560<br>do.</p>
<p>160<br>00:09:33,560 –&gt; 00:09:36,480<br>It should never send faster than this because to do so might cause a problem.</p>
<p>161<br>00:09:36,480 –&gt; 00:09:38,840<br>So then here’s another specification.</p>
<p>162<br>00:09:38,840 –&gt; 00:09:41,360<br>It says the initial value of the congestion window.</p>
<p>163<br>00:09:41,360 –&gt; 00:09:45,920<br>So when you start a TCP connection, what the congestion window’s initial window is, it</p>
<p>164<br>00:09:45,919 –&gt; 00:09:48,360<br>must be set following these parameters.</p>
<p>165<br>00:09:48,360 –&gt; 00:09:51,959<br>So basically if you have large segment sizes, then it should be two segments.</p>
<p>166<br>00:09:51,959 –&gt; 00:09:55,399<br>If you have medium size segments, it can be up to three segments.</p>
<p>167<br>00:09:55,399 –&gt; 00:09:58,039<br>And if you have small segments, it can be up to four segments.</p>
<p>168<br>00:09:58,039 –&gt; 00:10:01,759<br>There’s a statement of if you want to follow a TCP congestion control properly, here’s</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:01,759 –&gt; 00:10:05,679<br>which initial segment size can be the initial congestion window size.</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:05,679 –&gt; 00:10:07,279<br>So those are examples of must and must not.</p>
<p>171<br>00:10:07,279 –&gt; 00:10:09,360<br>Here’s an example of a should.</p>
<p>172<br>00:10:09,360 –&gt; 00:10:15,599<br>So this SS threshold is saying what is the initial slow start threshold, the initial threshold</p>
<p>173<br>00:10:15,600 –&gt; 00:10:20,360<br>at which we’re going to transition from slow start to congestion avoidance.</p>
<p>174<br>00:10:20,360 –&gt; 00:10:22,920<br>And so this document says that the initial value should be very, very high.</p>
<p>175<br>00:10:22,920 –&gt; 00:10:28,200<br>So that you just do slow start until essentially you get a loss and then you drop into congestion</p>
<p>176<br>00:10:28,200 –&gt; 00:10:29,680<br>avoidance.</p>
<p>177<br>00:10:29,680 –&gt; 00:10:33,720<br>However, you know, it can be smaller if you’d like.</p>
<p>178<br>00:10:33,720 –&gt; 00:10:37,560<br>And so it should be set arbitrarily high, but you cannot set it arbitrarily high.</p>
<p>179<br>00:10:37,560 –&gt; 00:10:43,000<br>You should understand who are the implications of what will happen if you do this.</p>
<p>180<br>00:10:43,000 –&gt; 00:10:47,200<br>So here’s an example of in fact a may and a should and a must not.</p>
<p>181<br>00:10:47,200 –&gt; 00:10:51,600<br>So it’s talking about when TCP is in congestion avoidance and it’s incrementing its congestion</p>
<p>182<br>00:10:51,600 –&gt; 00:10:55,919<br>window, it says, oh, you may increment congestion mean to buy certain number of bytes.</p>
<p>183<br>00:10:55,919 –&gt; 00:10:57,240<br>You had, in fact, you don’t have to.</p>
<p>184<br>00:10:57,240 –&gt; 00:10:58,879<br>You could just not if you want to.</p>
<p>185<br>00:10:58,879 –&gt; 00:11:00,799<br>You could not increase it.</p>
<p>186<br>00:11:00,799 –&gt; 00:11:06,279<br>But it should increment it once per RTT by this equation equation.</p>
<p>187<br>00:11:06,279 –&gt; 00:11:09,440<br>And it must not increment it more than this amount.</p>
<p>188<br>00:11:09,440 –&gt; 00:11:13,280<br>So this is basically saying, hey, here’s the upper bound.</p>
<p>189<br>00:11:13,280 –&gt; 00:11:17,040<br>And you should not ever do it more than that upper bound.</p>
<p>190<br>00:11:17,040 –&gt; 00:11:18,800<br>But you generally want to follow this equation.</p>
<p>191<br>00:11:18,800 –&gt; 00:11:20,280<br>You should follow this equation.</p>
<p>192<br>00:11:20,280 –&gt; 00:11:26,240<br>So all this aside, remember, so this document is saying something about how large the congestion,</p>
<p>193<br>00:11:26,240 –&gt; 00:11:29,000<br>how large the initial window size should be.</p>
<p>194<br>00:11:29,000 –&gt; 00:11:33,000<br>It must be this number of segments, two segments for large segment sizes, three for medium</p>
<p>195<br>00:11:33,000 –&gt; 00:11:35,880<br>size, four for small segments.</p>
<p>196<br>00:11:35,880 –&gt; 00:11:38,640<br>But remember, this is just an RC, right?</p>
<p>197<br>00:11:38,799 –&gt; 00:11:42,000<br>You can say that somebody isn’t compliant, but nobody is going to enforce it.</p>
<p>198<br>00:11:42,000 –&gt; 00:11:45,519<br>In fact, if you look at this web page here, there is this really interesting blog question</p>
<p>199<br>00:11:45,519 –&gt; 00:11:51,120<br>about two years ago about how Google and Microsoft were not following this RFC.</p>
<p>200<br>00:11:51,120 –&gt; 00:11:52,600<br>So if you want, you can look this up.</p>
<p>201<br>00:11:52,600 –&gt; 00:11:53,919<br>This is Ben Strong’s blog.</p>
<p>202<br>00:11:53,919 –&gt; 00:11:57,039<br>If you search for Google Microsoft congestion window cheat.</p>
<p>203<br>00:11:57,039 –&gt; 00:12:02,199<br>And essentially what he found is that when you first connect to Google or Microsoft sites,</p>
<p>204<br>00:12:02,199 –&gt; 00:12:05,439<br>their initial window is significantly larger than two.</p>
<p>205<br>00:12:05,440 –&gt; 00:12:09,520<br>But as they will send you more than two segments, essentially, so that they can send you their</p>
<p>206<br>00:12:09,520 –&gt; 00:12:14,040<br>whole web page in just one round trip time and not having to wait for the congestion window</p>
<p>207<br>00:12:14,040 –&gt; 00:12:15,040<br>to increase.</p>

<p>209<br>00:12:19,760 –&gt; 00:12:21,160<br>these guys were not following the rules.</p>
<p>210<br>00:12:21,160 –&gt; 00:12:24,800<br>Since there’s been then discussion in the ITF about maybe we need to increase these sizes,</p>
<p>211<br>00:12:24,800 –&gt; 00:12:26,400<br>networks are getting faster.</p>
<p>212<br>00:12:26,400 –&gt; 00:12:29,520<br>But the point here being that just because it’s written in our RFC and it says you must</p>
<p>213<br>00:12:29,520 –&gt; 00:12:32,160<br>do something, doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone always does.</p>
