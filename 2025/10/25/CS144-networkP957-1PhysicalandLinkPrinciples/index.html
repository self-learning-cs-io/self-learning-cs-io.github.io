                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:03,680<br>So in this video about the physical layer, I’m going to talk about two things.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:03,680 –&gt; 00:00:05,000<br>First, capacity.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:05,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,599<br>That is, how do we determine how many bits per second are given physical layer and support?</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:09,599 –&gt; 00:00:10,599<br>And then modulation.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:10,599 –&gt; 00:00:14,560<br>How is it that you represent these bits on the medium itself?</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:14,560 –&gt; 00:00:19,039<br>So it turns out that there’s a theoretical limit on how much information a given channel</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:19,039 –&gt; 00:00:20,039<br>can carry.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:20,039 –&gt; 00:00:25,199<br>Where this case, a channel means a medium in which you’re putting your information.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:25,199 –&gt; 00:00:28,439<br>This channel could be say a wire or a wireless.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:28,439 –&gt; 00:00:31,640<br>It could be sound waves, whatever you want.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:31,640 –&gt; 00:00:36,019<br>I mean, just a term that’s used to talk about the way in which the information is being</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:36,019 –&gt; 00:00:37,019<br>communicated.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:37,019 –&gt; 00:00:43,079<br>And so this limit is called the Shannon limit, after Claude Shannon, who established it.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:43,079 –&gt; 00:00:48,519<br>And so that turns out that if you look at a given communication channel and under a certain</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:48,519 –&gt; 00:00:52,000<br>set of assumptions, which often hold pretty well, there’s a very good approximation,</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:52,000 –&gt; 00:00:56,200<br>it gives you a good sense as to what’s possible.</p>
<p>17<br>00:00:56,200 –&gt; 00:01:03,079<br>The channel capacity, or the number of bits per second you can send over a given channel,</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:03,079 –&gt; 00:01:08,280<br>is B, base two log, one plus the signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:08,280 –&gt; 00:01:11,000<br>Where B is the bandwidth of your communication.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:11,000 –&gt; 00:01:13,400<br>That is what’s the range of frequencies you can use.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:13,400 –&gt; 00:01:20,039<br>This is assuming that we’re doing things with, basically, sound subtle waves, et cetera.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:20,040 –&gt; 00:01:25,560<br>This is the signal strength, the how strong is the signal when it arrives at the receiver.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:25,560 –&gt; 00:01:27,040<br>And N is the noise.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:27,040 –&gt; 00:01:31,719<br>So any receiver is going to have some kind of noise in the same way that when you’re listening,</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:31,719 –&gt; 00:01:36,960<br>you might think you hear silence, but there are sounds that are too faint for you to hear.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:36,960 –&gt; 00:01:41,000<br>It’s because those sounds are blow essentially the noise sensitivity of your ears.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:41,000 –&gt; 00:01:44,719<br>Or in the same way, if there’s a white noise generator in the room, it can make it harder</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:44,719 –&gt; 00:01:48,360<br>to hear things because there’s this noise.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:48,359 –&gt; 00:01:53,280<br>And so all communication devices have noise.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:53,280 –&gt; 00:01:55,799<br>Often it’s just due to thermal properties of the hardware.</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:55,799 –&gt; 00:01:58,480<br>They’re just stray electrons from thermal effects.</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:58,480 –&gt; 00:02:00,159<br>And so that introduces some noise in the system.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:00,159 –&gt; 00:02:01,480<br>It’s a big thing in your engineering them.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:01,480 –&gt; 00:02:04,599<br>How do you bring the noise down?</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:04,599 –&gt; 00:02:10,199<br>And so what the basic point here is that the amount that we can send is proportional to</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:10,199 –&gt; 00:02:15,400<br>the amount of bandwidth we have, like how large a chunk of frequencies can we use.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:15,400 –&gt; 00:02:17,800<br>And then the signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:17,800 –&gt; 00:02:22,200<br>Now if we wanted higher signal to noise ratio, it was just the signal divided by the noise.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:22,200 –&gt; 00:02:25,480<br>It requires either of lower noise that can be really expensive.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:25,480 –&gt; 00:02:28,360<br>It’s harder to make hardware with lower noise.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:28,360 –&gt; 00:02:31,360<br>Or a stronger signal requires that the signal be louder.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:31,360 –&gt; 00:02:35,720<br>This is for example why when you have more bars on your phone, it goes faster because the</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:35,720 –&gt; 00:02:41,520<br>signal to noise ratio of the data is faster because the signal to noise ratio is higher.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:41,520 –&gt; 00:02:45,120<br>And it turns out that building hardware for very high bandwidth, so signals that have a</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:45,120 –&gt; 00:02:47,599<br>tremendous bandwidth, it’s actually really hard.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:47,599 –&gt; 00:02:49,120<br>All these complications come into play.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:49,120 –&gt; 00:02:53,360<br>So it’s not like you can just easily build a communication system with arbitrary channel</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:53,360 –&gt; 00:02:54,360<br>capacity.</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:54,360 –&gt; 00:02:57,319<br>There are always engineering things that come into play, which is why we don’t suddenly</p>
<p>50<br>00:02:57,319 –&gt; 00:03:03,360<br>see a terabit ethernet.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:03,360 –&gt; 00:03:06,319<br>But so fun moments when we’re talking about the capacity of a channel, it’s talking about</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:06,319 –&gt; 00:03:08,520<br>bandwidth and signals noise.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:08,520 –&gt; 00:03:13,080<br>The way to think about this is in this how we generally represent signals is in terms of</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:13,080 –&gt; 00:03:14,080<br>analog signals.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:14,080 –&gt; 00:03:18,280<br>So we think sinusoid.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:18,280 –&gt; 00:03:24,040<br>And so when we’re talking about sinusoidal waves, here’s a simple one here.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:24,040 –&gt; 00:03:25,560<br>There are a couple properties we care about.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:25,560 –&gt; 00:03:28,920<br>They’re going to talk about in the rest of this and some future videos.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:28,920 –&gt; 00:03:31,000<br>The first is the amplitude of the wave.</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:31,000 –&gt; 00:03:40,000<br>So this is, so the amplitude denotes the actual one way to think of it is that how loud</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:40,000 –&gt; 00:03:44,000<br>it is, the signal strength, loudness.</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:44,000 –&gt; 00:03:48,840<br>The signal strength.</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:48,840 –&gt; 00:03:50,919<br>Second property is the wavelength.</p>
<p>64<br>00:03:50,919 –&gt; 00:03:53,479<br>So how long is one of these waves?</p>
<p>65<br>00:03:53,479 –&gt; 00:04:01,120<br>So the speed of light is approximately, so C, and in fact, it’s approximately one foot</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:01,120 –&gt; 00:04:03,319<br>per nanosecond.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:03,319 –&gt; 00:04:05,319<br>That’s a good rough rule of thumb.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:05,319 –&gt; 00:04:16,399<br>So one billion feet per second.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:16,399 –&gt; 00:04:24,279<br>And so if, for example, I’m sending a signal whose wavelength is one foot, this would</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:24,279 –&gt; 00:04:32,719<br>mean that it has a wavelength of one foot since the wave is traveling one billion feet</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:32,719 –&gt; 00:04:33,719<br>per second.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:33,720 –&gt; 00:04:36,720<br>It means there must be one billion waves per second.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:36,720 –&gt; 00:04:40,680<br>Because this wave is traveling at a billion feet per second, the wavelength is a foot,</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:40,680 –&gt; 00:04:43,840<br>unless the billion waves per second, this gives me the frequency.</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:43,840 –&gt; 00:04:45,720<br>So how many waves do I expect a second?</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:45,720 –&gt; 00:04:50,120<br>So one billion per second turns to be one gigahertz.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:50,120 –&gt; 00:04:57,160<br>So one gigahertz wave in, this is electromagnetic, this is light, just at lower frequencies,</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:57,160 –&gt; 00:05:01,840<br>a one-foot, a one gigahertz signal has a wavelength of about a foot.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:01,839 –&gt; 00:05:09,359<br>So Wi-Fi today, for example, operates at 2.4 gigahertz or around five gigahertz.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:09,359 –&gt; 00:05:22,159<br>So these have wavelengths of approximately five inches and 2.4 inches.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:22,159 –&gt; 00:05:26,079<br>So here I’m talking about the frequency, the wavelength of a given wave, the amplitude</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:26,079 –&gt; 00:05:27,079<br>of a given wave.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:27,079 –&gt; 00:05:30,399<br>But it turns out that we send signals, you don’t use a single frequency, you actually use</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:30,399 –&gt; 00:05:31,399<br>a range of frequencies.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:31,759 –&gt; 00:05:35,039<br>The bandwidth is the size of the frequency ranges that we use.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:35,039 –&gt; 00:05:41,439<br>For example, if you look at one Wi-Fi standard 802.11b, it’s an older one, you use that as</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:41,439 –&gt; 00:05:45,000<br>a common example because it’s one of the simpler ones since it’s older.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:45,000 –&gt; 00:05:49,879<br>In 802.11b, if you, those you have used it, you have to select a channel.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:49,879 –&gt; 00:05:53,759<br>So channels one through 11.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:53,759 –&gt; 00:05:58,319<br>Often people use one six and 11.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:58,319 –&gt; 00:06:03,360<br>Each of these channels is 20 megahertz wide.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:03,360 –&gt; 00:06:08,439<br>And so when you look at a frequency map for 802.11b, you can see that all these channels,</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:08,439 –&gt; 00:06:14,959<br>and here’s one, and here’s 11, and they take up about 20 megahertz of the frequency range,</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:14,959 –&gt; 00:06:18,959<br>like so.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:18,959 –&gt; 00:06:22,199<br>And so you actually use a range of frequencies, and I’ll show you why this happens and how</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:22,199 –&gt; 00:06:23,800<br>this happens.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:23,800 –&gt; 00:06:27,319<br>So finally, there’s what we call phase.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:27,319 –&gt; 00:06:30,920<br>And so this is actually the timing of the waves within a wavelength.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:30,920 –&gt; 00:06:35,800<br>So here we have, here’s a wave, which is at this particular phase where the peak is</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:35,800 –&gt; 00:06:36,800<br>occurring here.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:36,800 –&gt; 00:06:39,279<br>So let’s call this T0.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:39,279 –&gt; 00:06:48,560<br>It’s of course possible to send this exact same wave, but at a different phase.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:48,560 –&gt; 00:06:54,240<br>For example, we could send it like this.</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:54,240 –&gt; 00:07:03,639<br>It’s the same wave, but its phase is off set by one half of the wavelength, and therefore</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:03,639 –&gt; 00:07:05,639<br>180 degrees.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:05,639 –&gt; 00:07:09,920<br>So it turns out that things we do to control, as we’ll see in a second, that we do to control</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:09,920 –&gt; 00:07:14,160<br>waves, that we do to send signals involved changing the amplitude of waves, changing the frequency</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:14,160 –&gt; 00:07:16,319<br>of waves, as well as changing the phase of these waves.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:16,319 –&gt; 00:07:20,480<br>But fundamentally, these waves are what’s going on underneath in the system.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:20,480 –&gt; 00:07:24,160<br>So given that we’re using waves, there’s a whole bunch of waves we can represent bits.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:24,160 –&gt; 00:07:28,480<br>So in the simplest way, this is what we call amplitude shift keying, or ASK.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:28,480 –&gt; 00:07:30,640<br>And this process is called modulation.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:30,640 –&gt; 00:07:35,320<br>How do I take a signal, or take a particular bit of piece of data, and then modulate my</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:35,320 –&gt; 00:07:38,000<br>waves to represent that signal?</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:38,000 –&gt; 00:07:42,200<br>So here, to represent that data, how do I modulate the signal to represent the data?</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:42,200 –&gt; 00:07:47,440<br>So here, for example, I have an amplitude shift keying where one has a small amplitude,</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:47,440 –&gt; 00:07:50,480<br>I’m sorry, zero has a small amplitude, and one has a larger amplitude.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:50,480 –&gt; 00:07:51,720<br>So I want to send a zero.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:51,720 –&gt; 00:07:56,680<br>I send this smaller wave, and one has a smaller one, and one has a larger one.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:56,680 –&gt; 00:08:00,360<br>Another approach that you can use is called frequency shift keying, where you use two separate</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:00,360 –&gt; 00:08:01,520<br>frequencies.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:01,520 –&gt; 00:08:03,280<br>And so here’s a one, and here’s a zero.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:03,280 –&gt; 00:08:07,040<br>The zero happens to be the higher frequency, the one is the lower frequency.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:07,040 –&gt; 00:08:10,920<br>And then as I want to send out a stream of zeroes and ones, I just move these frequencies</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:10,920 –&gt; 00:08:11,920<br>back and forth.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:11,920 –&gt; 00:08:15,480<br>Oh, I’m sending one on one, so it’s longer, longer, longer, than zero, zero, zero, zero,</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:15,480 –&gt; 00:08:17,160<br>shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:17,160 –&gt; 00:08:20,400<br>The other side can decode these and then figure out what bits are being sent.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:20,399 –&gt; 00:08:25,399<br>So amplitude shift keying turns out to be very, it’s very commonly used, especially in</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:25,399 –&gt; 00:08:26,399<br>wired networks.</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:26,399 –&gt; 00:08:30,079<br>And the reason is that when you have a wire, your meeting is controlled, the signal you</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:30,079 –&gt; 00:08:33,679<br>put on one side, it decreases a little bit on the other side, but not by very much.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:33,679 –&gt; 00:08:38,399<br>Wires do not have a lot of resistance, that’s why they use them to carry power.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:38,399 –&gt; 00:08:42,639<br>And so amplitude shift keying is commonly used in wired systems, just because it’s very</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:42,639 –&gt; 00:08:44,879<br>simple, and it works great.</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:44,879 –&gt; 00:08:49,480<br>So most common wired ethernet today uses amplitude shift keying.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:49,480 –&gt; 00:08:56,200<br>For example, 100 base T and 1000 base T, there’s 100 megabit and gigabit ethernet, use what’s</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:56,200 –&gt; 00:09:01,039<br>called PAM5, which means five levels of amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:01,039 –&gt; 00:09:06,080<br>It’s called pulses, kyrsion, these pulses of these different amplitudes.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:06,080 –&gt; 00:09:12,200<br>So think of these basically as voltages minus two, minus one, zero, plus one, plus two.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:12,200 –&gt; 00:09:18,879<br>And so you’re sending these different voltages along the wire.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:18,879 –&gt; 00:09:26,159<br>There’s a 10 base T or 10 gigabit ethernet, more of the upcoming standard people are adopting.</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:26,159 –&gt; 00:09:30,439<br>Needs to use more levels of amplitudes in order to get all of its data through it.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:30,439 –&gt; 00:09:36,639<br>So it uses PAM16, so 16 levels rather than five.</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:36,639 –&gt; 00:09:41,919<br>So another form of modulation that’s really popular is what’s called phase shift keying.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:41,919 –&gt; 00:09:45,759<br>So unlike amplitude shift keying, you’re adjusting the amps through the waves, or frequency shift</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:45,759 –&gt; 00:09:47,240<br>keying, we’re using different frequencies.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:47,240 –&gt; 00:09:50,399<br>With phase shift keying, you adjust the phase of the waves.</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:50,399 –&gt; 00:09:56,159<br>So here, for example, let’s say zero, this is a phase of zero degrees.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:56,159 –&gt; 00:09:59,000<br>But then to send a one, as you can see, my phase is reversed.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:59,000 –&gt; 00:10:03,120<br>This is a phase of 180 degrees, right, or minus 180 degrees.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:03,120 –&gt; 00:10:04,759<br>The two are the same.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:04,759 –&gt; 00:10:10,519<br>And then here to send a zero again, I start sending at a phase of zero degrees again.</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:10,519 –&gt; 00:10:16,579<br>The phase shift keying is really useful when your channel, when your medium is such that</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:16,579 –&gt; 00:10:19,600<br>you can have significant variations in signal strength.</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:19,600 –&gt; 00:10:22,639<br>So amplitude shift keying needs to be able to figure out all the different amplitudes are.</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:22,639 –&gt; 00:10:28,340<br>So when the actual attenuation with signal strength is stable, like in a wire that’s great.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:28,340 –&gt; 00:10:32,199<br>But for example, in wireless situations, amplitude is a bit harder.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:32,199 –&gt; 00:10:34,360<br>Phase is much can be easier.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:34,360 –&gt; 00:10:38,679<br>So situations where phase shift keying is used are, I’d say, DSL digital subscriber lines,</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:38,679 –&gt; 00:10:45,120<br>you’ll get a long long phone lines where there could be weather and wire shaking and bad connections.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:45,120 –&gt; 00:10:49,799<br>But really long wires, cable modems, right, that are stretching out through an entire neighborhood.</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:49,799 –&gt; 00:10:53,039<br>Wireless systems, these all use phase shift keying.</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:53,039 –&gt; 00:10:59,319<br>I’m selling them also use amplitude, but they, unlike wire ethernet, all these systems use phase.</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:59,319 –&gt; 00:11:04,000<br>And so one kind of phase shift keying is binary phase shift keying, or BPSK.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:04,000 –&gt; 00:11:09,840<br>And so you basically have two phases, zero, zero degrees, and pi are 180 degrees.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:09,840 –&gt; 00:11:22,679<br>And so like in that prior picture, you’re either sending something at this phase, let’s say that zero,</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:22,679 –&gt; 00:11:26,799<br>or you’re sending it at this phase, which is say 180 degrees.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:26,799 –&gt; 00:11:29,959<br>So this is 180 degrees, pi.</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:34,959 –&gt; 00:11:37,879<br>This is zero, zero.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:37,879 –&gt; 00:11:44,719<br>So for example, BPSK is used in 802.11b and older Wi-Fi standard at low speeds, one megabit and two megabit per second.</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:46,879 –&gt; 00:11:50,399<br>There’s also a quadrature phase shift keying, keying, QPSK.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:50,399 –&gt; 00:11:52,039<br>We’re now we have four phases.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:52,039 –&gt; 00:11:56,679<br>And as you can imagine, just as we have zero and 180 degrees with QPSK,</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:56,679 –&gt; 00:12:05,079<br>we have zero, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270, or zero pi over two, pi, three pi over two, radians and computers respectively.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:05,079 –&gt; 00:12:09,120<br>So it turns out QPSK is also used in this older Wi-Fi standard AO2.11b.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:09,120 –&gt; 00:12:14,199<br>It’s used at the higher speeds, 5.5 megabits per second and 11 megabits per second.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:14,199 –&gt; 00:12:21,839<br>Now one thing that should come out from this is that the reason why we might use QPSK versus BPSK or PAM16 rather than PAM5</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:21,839 –&gt; 00:12:25,359<br>is that for a given signal we’re sending, we can send more information.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:25,360 –&gt; 00:12:29,960<br>So for example, BPSK, each wave we send carries one bit of information.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:29,960 –&gt; 00:12:31,720<br>Is it zero or pi?</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:31,720 –&gt; 00:12:35,800<br>In contrast for QPSK, each symbol that we send on the waves,</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:35,800 –&gt; 00:12:39,720<br>each little chunk of data we’re sending at the physical air contains two bits.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:39,720 –&gt; 00:12:43,440<br>Is it zero, pi over two, pi, or three pi over two?</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:43,440 –&gt; 00:12:48,080<br>You could say represent those as zero, zero, one, one, one, one.</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:48,080 –&gt; 00:12:52,840<br>That’s not actually how it’s done, but the idea is you can actually, by having these denser representations,</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:52,840 –&gt; 00:12:55,320<br>you’re sending more information per unit time.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:55,360 –&gt; 00:12:59,960<br>Now one reason why phase shift king is where popters actually turns out it’s very easy to shift phase.</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:59,960 –&gt; 00:13:05,120<br>So for example, here if I just have a carrier wave at say zero degrees,</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:05,120 –&gt; 00:13:08,640<br>and another carrier wave, you know, minus 90 degrees,</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:08,640 –&gt; 00:13:13,000<br>then any linear combination of these two allows me to create any intermediate frequency.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:13,000 –&gt; 00:13:18,120<br>So for example, here if I combine zero degrees with minus 90 degrees, just add these two waves up,</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:18,120 –&gt; 00:13:20,760<br>I’ll get something at minus 45 degrees.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:20,760 –&gt; 00:13:24,520<br>That’s if it’s a, you know, sort of one to one equality.</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:24,519 –&gt; 00:13:31,039<br>If, for example, instead I did 0.5, one, then we’d have something a little closer to,</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:31,039 –&gt; 00:13:33,919<br>uh, to the zero degrees, right?</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:33,919 –&gt; 00:13:37,519<br>Assuming that this is the minus 90 degrees, and this is the zero degrees.</p>
<p>198<br>00:13:37,519 –&gt; 00:13:45,039<br>Similarly, if I did, uh, rather than one one, if I did minus one one, so this is minus 90 degrees,</p>
<p>199<br>00:13:45,039 –&gt; 00:13:50,840<br>this is zero degrees, then what we’d see is rather than a wave between these two,</p>
<p>200<br>00:13:51,120 –&gt; 00:13:53,120<br>the wave would be,</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:57,040 –&gt; 00:13:59,399<br>the wave would be here, right?</p>
<p>202<br>00:13:59,399 –&gt; 00:14:03,560<br>It would be at plus 45 degrees with this setting.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:03,560 –&gt; 00:14:07,200<br>And so just for these two things, you can combine and create any intermediate frequency you want,</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:07,200 –&gt; 00:14:09,160<br>which turns to be really useful in hardware.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:09,160 –&gt; 00:14:13,440<br>And in fact, that’s exactly how hardware does it, using something called IQ modulation.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:13,440 –&gt; 00:14:16,400<br>Uh, so I means the in phase component, so at zero degrees,</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:16,400 –&gt; 00:14:18,680<br>Q is the quadratriter component and minus 90 degrees,</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:18,679 –&gt; 00:14:25,959<br>there’s just a complex way of saying, hey, if we want to create any, any, uh, phase between zero and,</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:25,959 –&gt; 00:14:30,559<br>you know, say 300, you know, zero and basically minus zero wrapping around, um,</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:30,559 –&gt; 00:14:35,519<br>we can just combine these two I and Q with some linear factor and get that.</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:35,519 –&gt; 00:14:38,599<br>Um, so for example, let’s look at those two,</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:38,599 –&gt; 00:14:41,519<br>there’s two things we had of BPS, PK and QPSK.</p>
<p>213<br>00:14:41,519 –&gt; 00:14:45,799<br>So BPSK has two phases, zero and 180 degrees.</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:45,799 –&gt; 00:14:47,799<br>What are the IQ values of those?</p>
<p>215<br>00:14:49,079 –&gt; 00:14:55,599<br>Well, so for zero degrees, it’s going to be 1, zero, right?</p>
<p>216<br>00:14:55,599 –&gt; 00:14:58,079<br>We want fully at zero degrees.</p>
<p>217<br>00:14:58,079 –&gt; 00:15:03,319<br>For 180 degrees, well, that’s the opposite of zero, right?</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:03,319 –&gt; 00:15:08,879<br>It’s if you were to think about it, you know, on the unit circle, say, here’s zero,</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:08,879 –&gt; 00:15:11,000<br>here’s 180 degrees.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:11,000 –&gt; 00:15:14,079<br>So just as here we had plus one, here we’re going to have minus one.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:14,079 –&gt; 00:15:17,439<br>So minus one, zero.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:17,440 –&gt; 00:15:19,720<br>For QPSK, we’re going to have four phases.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:19,720 –&gt; 00:15:22,520<br>Let’s say zero, two, seventy, one, 80 and 90.</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:22,520 –&gt; 00:15:26,160<br>So again, zero is going to be one comma zero.</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:26,160 –&gt; 00:15:31,360<br>But now 270, right, 270 is down here, right?</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:31,360 –&gt; 00:15:34,560<br>So here’s minus 90 slash 270.</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:34,560 –&gt; 00:15:35,560<br>Right?</p>
<p>228<br>00:15:35,560 –&gt; 00:15:39,760<br>So 270 is going to be zero comma one.</p>
<p>229<br>00:15:39,760 –&gt; 00:15:45,000<br>180 is going to be just like in BPSK, minus one comma zero.</p>
<p>230<br>00:15:45,000 –&gt; 00:15:50,840<br>And 90 is going to be zero comma minus one.</p>
<p>231<br>00:15:50,840 –&gt; 00:15:57,240<br>And so we can just by changing the scaling factors of the i and Q, create any phase we</p>
<p>232<br>00:15:57,240 –&gt; 00:15:58,240<br>want of a signal.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:58,240 –&gt; 00:16:01,840<br>That’s exactly what it looks like in hardware, is that we have these IQ values coming in,</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:01,840 –&gt; 00:16:06,200<br>these digital values, then we have these two carrier frequencies, and we end up adding</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:06,200 –&gt; 00:16:09,919<br>them up to come out on the R. Since then what comes out of the antenna.</p>
<p>236<br>00:16:09,919 –&gt; 00:16:14,200<br>So it’s actually how you build a hardware with these IQ, these IQ values.</p>
<p>237<br>00:16:14,200 –&gt; 00:16:17,560<br>But what’s really valuable, and the reason why I’m going into them about IQ constellations</p>
<p>238<br>00:16:17,560 –&gt; 00:16:22,960<br>is that they actually lend themselves to a really, really simple and easy to understand</p>
<p>239<br>00:16:22,960 –&gt; 00:16:27,560<br>graphical representation of what’s going on down in the physical layer.</p>
<p>240<br>00:16:27,560 –&gt; 00:16:31,000<br>And so the way I think this, if we take these IQ values and we just represent them on a 2D</p>
<p>241<br>00:16:31,000 –&gt; 00:16:36,080<br>grid, right, we can use what’s called an IQ constellation, this 2D plot.</p>
<p>242<br>00:16:36,080 –&gt; 00:16:41,879<br>In this case, in these 2D plots, the angle of your vector represents the phase of the</p>
<p>243<br>00:16:41,879 –&gt; 00:16:49,000<br>signal, right, like here say we have 45 degrees, right, here we have 135 degrees, and then</p>
<p>244<br>00:16:49,000 –&gt; 00:16:52,679<br>the length of this vector represents the amplitude of the signal.</p>
<p>245<br>00:16:52,679 –&gt; 00:16:56,600<br>So if we look at something like on-off-king where you either send something or it’s silent,</p>
<p>246<br>00:16:56,600 –&gt; 00:17:00,840<br>we see here’s an amplitude of 1, amplitude of 0, there’s more on-off-king, right, there’s</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:00,840 –&gt; 00:17:02,919<br>no change in the phase.</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:02,919 –&gt; 00:17:06,839<br>Amplitude shift-king where we have two different amplitudes to use, see here’s a 1, and</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:06,839 –&gt; 00:17:09,119<br>here’s a 0, we’re just changing the amplitudes.</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:09,119 –&gt; 00:17:13,679<br>We’re not actually changing the phase, we’re just changing the value of i.</p>
<p>251<br>00:17:13,679 –&gt; 00:17:18,919<br>BPSK, remember there are two phases, 0 and 180, and so that’s what we see here.</p>
<p>252<br>00:17:18,919 –&gt; 00:17:26,159<br>So here is 180 to say represent the 1, and here is 0, say to represent the 0.</p>
<p>253<br>00:17:26,159 –&gt; 00:17:32,159<br>QPSK also has four points, with these four different phases, I could have also rotated</p>
<p>254<br>00:17:32,159 –&gt; 00:17:36,559<br>them and say drawn them like this, but still easier to see them when they’re these four</p>
<p>255<br>00:17:36,559 –&gt; 00:17:38,599<br>corners like this.</p>
<p>256<br>00:17:38,599 –&gt; 00:17:43,199<br>So this is a way to represent what the wireless signals is, it’s this nice pictorial representation,</p>
<p>257<br>00:17:43,199 –&gt; 00:17:47,240<br>where we start talking about signal and noise, and those ratios, things will start to make</p>
<p>258<br>00:17:47,240 –&gt; 00:17:51,399<br>a little more sense, it’ll be a really clear depiction of what’s happening.</p>
<p>259<br>00:17:51,399 –&gt; 00:17:57,279<br>And so just recall, we can represent any intermediate phase from this 0 and minus 90, there’s</p>
<p>260<br>00:17:57,279 –&gt; 00:17:59,439<br>just some linear combination of those two.</p>
<p>261<br>00:17:59,439 –&gt; 00:18:04,379<br>Now at some point, at the link layer, we have bits, bits are coming in, we have some</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:04,380 –&gt; 00:18:08,820<br>packet, from the network layer, and we have some frame at the link layer with some bits,</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:08,820 –&gt; 00:18:14,180<br>and 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, organized into bytes and doctats, however.</p>
<p>264<br>00:18:14,180 –&gt; 00:18:19,300<br>But now at the physical error, we don’t necessarily can’t necessarily transmit a whole byte.</p>
<p>265<br>00:18:19,300 –&gt; 00:18:23,180<br>It might be that we can only transmit a couple bits at a time.</p>
<p>266<br>00:18:23,180 –&gt; 00:18:25,420<br>And so in the physical error, we talk about symbols.</p>
<p>267<br>00:18:25,420 –&gt; 00:18:31,900<br>And the symbol is the unit of transfer, the physical error can provide.</p>
<p>268<br>00:18:31,900 –&gt; 00:18:35,880<br>And often we talk about things at the link layer, we talk about, oh, we add a byte, but</p>
<p>269<br>00:18:35,880 –&gt; 00:18:38,820<br>that might not be the boundary down at the physical error.</p>
<p>270<br>00:18:38,820 –&gt; 00:18:42,420<br>The reason is, as I talked about before, a symbol can contain more than one bit.</p>
<p>271<br>00:18:42,420 –&gt; 00:18:45,940<br>So BPSK has one bit per symbol, there’s two phases.</p>
<p>272<br>00:18:45,940 –&gt; 00:18:50,259<br>QPSK has four phases, has two bits per symbol.</p>
<p>273<br>00:18:50,259 –&gt; 00:18:56,019<br>But then you also get situations like, like, PAM5 that’s used in 100 megabit and 1 gigabit</p>
<p>274<br>00:18:56,019 –&gt; 00:18:59,300<br>ethernet on a cat5 cable, where there’s these five voltage levels.</p>
<p>275<br>00:18:59,299 –&gt; 00:19:03,419<br>There are five different symbols that you can use.</p>
<p>276<br>00:19:03,419 –&gt; 00:19:08,099<br>And that doesn’t necessarily even map perfectly to a number of bits, right?</p>
<p>277<br>00:19:08,099 –&gt; 00:19:12,619<br>Five symbols is just over two bits.</p>
<p>278<br>00:19:12,619 –&gt; 00:19:16,379<br>It’s that’s important to realize that although up at the link layer even passed down to the</p>
<p>279<br>00:19:16,379 –&gt; 00:19:20,980<br>physical area of a sequence of bits, there’s this transformation that occurs, turning that sequence</p>
<p>280<br>00:19:20,980 –&gt; 00:19:29,139<br>of bits into a sequence of symbols down at the physical layer.</p>
<p>281<br>00:19:29,140 –&gt; 00:19:36,340<br>So finally, I talked about amplitude king, I’ve talked about phase king.</p>
<p>282<br>00:19:36,340 –&gt; 00:19:38,340<br>There’s this approach you use today.</p>
<p>283<br>00:19:38,340 –&gt; 00:19:39,340<br>It’s very, very common.</p>
<p>284<br>00:19:39,340 –&gt; 00:19:44,880<br>You see it almost all modern communication systems called QUAM, which really stands for</p>
<p>285<br>00:19:44,880 –&gt; 00:19:46,660<br>quadrature amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>286<br>00:19:46,660 –&gt; 00:19:57,540<br>Basically this means phase and amplitude king at the same time.</p>
<p>287<br>00:19:57,539 –&gt; 00:20:02,019<br>And so whereas ASK, amplitude shift king is only the amplitude and phase shift king is</p>
<p>288<br>00:20:02,019 –&gt; 00:20:05,940<br>only the phase and QUAM we use both.</p>
<p>289<br>00:20:05,940 –&gt; 00:20:09,940<br>So to give you an example, the way this is usually talked about, say 16 QUAM means that</p>
<p>290<br>00:20:09,940 –&gt; 00:20:11,859<br>we have 16 different symbols.</p>
<p>291<br>00:20:11,859 –&gt; 00:20:14,899<br>And so we can represent free symbol, we can represent four bits.</p>
<p>292<br>00:20:14,899 –&gt; 00:20:17,819<br>256 QUAM means there’s 256 different symbols.</p>
<p>293<br>00:20:17,819 –&gt; 00:20:21,740<br>And so we can represent for each symbol, we can represent eight bits.</p>
<p>294<br>00:20:21,740 –&gt; 00:20:27,460<br>And so returning to the IQ plot, we’re a modulation plot, here’s what 16 QUAM looks like.</p>
<p>295<br>00:20:27,460 –&gt; 00:20:34,460<br>So this is the constellation, the IQ constellation used in a just PDA, which is a 3G data standard.</p>
<p>296<br>00:20:34,460 –&gt; 00:20:39,100<br>And so you can see there are these values from 3, 3 to minus 3, minus 3.</p>
<p>297<br>00:20:39,100 –&gt; 00:20:41,660<br>And they map to different bits.</p>
<p>298<br>00:20:41,660 –&gt; 00:20:45,620<br>And so here I’ve shown in gray the I and Q values.</p>
<p>299<br>00:20:45,620 –&gt; 00:20:52,380<br>So here’s an IF3, a Q of 1, IF3, Q of 3, IF-1, Q of 1, sorry.</p>
<p>300<br>00:20:52,380 –&gt; 00:20:56,700<br>And then what the represented bits are above the physical layer.</p>
<p>301<br>00:20:56,700 –&gt; 00:21:00,500<br>And so here’s an example IQ constellation for 16 QUAM.</p>
<p>302<br>00:21:00,500 –&gt; 00:21:06,580<br>As we can see, it’s adjusting not only the amplitude, that is the length of the vector</p>
<p>303<br>00:21:06,580 –&gt; 00:21:13,140<br>coming out of the origin, but also the phase, which is the orientation of the vector coming</p>
<p>304<br>00:21:13,140 –&gt; 00:21:15,180<br>out of the origin.</p>
<p>305<br>00:21:15,180 –&gt; 00:21:21,500<br>Here’s an example IQ constellation used in modern 3G systems, 16 QUAM, 16 different</p>
<p>306<br>00:21:21,500 –&gt; 00:21:22,500<br>symbols.</p>
<p>307<br>00:21:22,500 –&gt; 00:21:25,259<br>And here’s how bits map to these symbols.</p>
<p>308<br>00:21:25,259 –&gt; 00:21:36,819<br>So for example, if I wanted to send a 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, I would send 1, 0, 1, 1,</p>
<p>309<br>00:21:36,819 –&gt; 00:21:37,819<br>1.</p>
<p>310<br>00:21:37,819 –&gt; 00:21:39,380<br>So it’s send this first.</p>
<p>311<br>00:21:39,380 –&gt; 00:21:45,660<br>This would be the first symbol that I send, number 1.</p>
<p>312<br>00:21:45,660 –&gt; 00:21:54,700<br>And 1, 0, 0, 1, I would send this symbol, second.</p>
<p>313<br>00:21:54,700 –&gt; 00:21:58,019<br>And so if we’re to go down and dig into and see what’s happening down in the physical</p>
<p>314<br>00:21:58,019 –&gt; 00:22:07,420<br>layer, we’re going to see a signal transmitted with a phase of what’s essentially 135 degrees,</p>
<p>315<br>00:22:07,420 –&gt; 00:22:08,420<br>right?</p>
<p>316<br>00:22:08,420 –&gt; 00:22:10,700<br>This is 135 degrees.</p>
<p>317<br>00:22:10,700 –&gt; 00:22:14,259<br>And an amplitude, let’s say, of x.</p>
<p>318<br>00:22:14,259 –&gt; 00:22:22,819<br>And the next symbol is going to be with this angle, with this phase, which is approximately,</p>
<p>319<br>00:22:22,819 –&gt; 00:22:26,339<br>let’s say 105 degrees.</p>
<p>320<br>00:22:26,339 –&gt; 00:22:30,099<br>And it’s slightly smaller amplitude, because this vector is longer.</p>
<p>321<br>00:22:30,099 –&gt; 00:22:35,819<br>And so that’s what you actually see in terms of the ways in the physical layer.</p>
<p>322<br>00:22:35,819 –&gt; 00:22:36,819<br>So what’s used today?</p>
<p>323<br>00:22:36,819 –&gt; 00:22:40,819<br>Well, as amplitude shift king, it’s basically all a wider than it uses the amplitude</p>
<p>324<br>00:22:40,819 –&gt; 00:22:41,819<br>shift king.</p>
<p>325<br>00:22:42,700 –&gt; 00:22:45,939<br>It’s very rare for communication systems to use frequency shift king.</p>
<p>326<br>00:22:45,939 –&gt; 00:22:49,379<br>There are some examples like the National Weather Services Weather Radio and Bluetooth</p>
<p>327<br>00:22:49,379 –&gt; 00:22:53,299<br>actually uses it in some forms.</p>
<p>328<br>00:22:53,299 –&gt; 00:22:58,539<br>Binary phase shift king is used basically by all the Wi-Fi standards, ABGM.</p>
<p>329<br>00:22:58,539 –&gt; 00:23:01,179<br>It’s also used in Wi-Max.</p>
<p>330<br>00:23:01,179 –&gt; 00:23:03,740<br>Quadrature phase shift king is used in Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>331<br>00:23:03,740 –&gt; 00:23:07,419<br>There’s low power wireless, like ZigBee called 8254.</p>
<p>332<br>00:23:07,419 –&gt; 00:23:10,179<br>3G, LTE, Wi-Max.</p>
<p>333<br>00:23:10,180 –&gt; 00:23:16,100<br>16 quam is used in Wi-Fi as well as these data standards for cellular phones, for mobile</p>
<p>334<br>00:23:16,100 –&gt; 00:23:17,860<br>phones, mobile telephony.</p>
<p>335<br>00:23:17,860 –&gt; 00:23:21,500<br>64 quam is used in Wi-Fi as well as LTE and Wi-Max.</p>
<p>336<br>00:23:21,500 –&gt; 00:23:28,140<br>And so you can see that there are these, the older, that the more modern standards, the</p>
<p>337<br>00:23:28,140 –&gt; 00:23:31,740<br>one that are using the denser constellations, people who made things go faster and faster.</p>
<p>338<br>00:23:31,740 –&gt; 00:23:33,299<br>So there’s an overview.</p>
<p>339<br>00:23:33,299 –&gt; 00:23:38,460<br>There are many different ways that you can take your bits and then represent them in terms</p>
<p>340<br>00:23:38,460 –&gt; 00:23:44,660<br>of a physical medium, convert them into voltages, phases, frequencies, etc.</p>
<p>341<br>00:23:44,660 –&gt; 00:23:49,019<br>Wired Ethernet and wired systems often use amplitude to represent signals.</p>
<p>342<br>00:23:49,019 –&gt; 00:23:56,380<br>Whereas most technologies today, wireless technologies or things that are over less control</p>
<p>343<br>00:23:56,380 –&gt; 00:24:01,940<br>of media like cable modems, DSL, use phase shift king or a combination phase in amplitude</p>
<p>344<br>00:24:01,940 –&gt; 00:24:05,660<br>called quam, quadrature amplitude modulation.</p>
<p>345<br>00:24:05,660 –&gt; 00:24:09,259<br>One of the key things that you can represent at quam symbol, in fact any of these, as a</p>
<p>346<br>00:24:09,259 –&gt; 00:24:12,019<br>linear combination of two things.</p>
<p>347<br>00:24:12,019 –&gt; 00:24:17,540<br>The in-phase component i at zero degrees and the quadrature component q at minus 90 degrees.</p>
<p>348<br>00:24:17,540 –&gt; 00:24:20,180<br>This is actually how circuits do it today.</p>
<p>349<br>00:24:20,180 –&gt; 00:24:27,500<br>And what’s really nice is that it gives you a very good pictorial representation of what</p>
<p>350<br>00:24:27,500 –&gt; 00:24:31,420<br>the signal looks like and how it’s controlled and how it’s modulated and how those</p>
<p>351<br>00:24:31,420 –&gt; 00:24:32,100<br>map to bits.</p>
