                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,080<br>So in this video about the physical error, we talk about bit errors and coding, a way to</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,080 –&gt; 00:00:10,400<br>introduce some redundancy into data is that you can protect yourself against bit errors.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,400 –&gt; 00:00:15,759<br>So recall that the Shannon limit, the capacity of a communication channel, is determined</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:15,759 –&gt; 00:00:21,600<br>by the bandwidth and then the base 2 log of 1 plus the signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,600 –&gt; 00:00:25,719<br>And so basically what this means is that in practice, the available data rate, the possible</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:25,719 –&gt; 00:00:30,519<br>data rate is bounded by this signal to noise ratio. So if your signal is stronger, you</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:30,519 –&gt; 00:00:35,320<br>can send data faster. If the noise on your circuit is lower, you can send data faster.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:35,320 –&gt; 00:00:39,759<br>So important is that this is a theoretical limit. Just because we know we can’t do better,</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:39,759 –&gt; 00:00:43,799<br>doesn’t we know how to get there. In fact, a few systems today can actually get there.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:43,799 –&gt; 00:00:48,000<br>We’re getting close, but doesn’t actually say how to do it just that it’s impossible</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,000 –&gt; 00:00:53,960<br>to do better. So often for a variety of reasons, your bandwidth is typically fixed. Say, if</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:53,960 –&gt; 00:00:59,480<br>you are operating in some unlicensed spectrum like your Wi-Fi or something, the FCC says,</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:59,480 –&gt; 00:01:03,280<br>hey, you can’t do more than this. You can’t use more than this bandwidth. And so often,</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:03,280 –&gt; 00:01:08,719<br>what systems are trying to do is improve the signal to noise ratio. But basically what</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,719 –&gt; 00:01:12,680<br>it means is that if your signal strength is higher, then you can transmit data faster.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,680 –&gt; 00:01:18,079<br>You can either transmit symbols shorter, you can transmit them for shorter periods of time,</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,079 –&gt; 00:01:22,400<br>or you can put more bits per symbol. You can make your actual constellation denser, the</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:22,400 –&gt; 00:01:31,280<br>IQ constellation. So here we’re transmitting this perfect black signal. But the problem is that</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,280 –&gt; 00:01:35,520<br>this perfect wave, because there’s noise on the receiver just in the hardware, what we</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:35,520 –&gt; 00:01:40,200<br>receive is closer to this red signal. All of this noise introduced. And so let’s take</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:40,200 –&gt; 00:01:44,680<br>a step back and think, what does that mean? How would that appear to a receiver? So let’s</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:44,680 –&gt; 00:01:49,520<br>go back to this 16-quam constellation I showed you when talking about IQ modulation and</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:49,519 –&gt; 00:01:53,799<br>signal modulation. So this is a constellation used in HSPA of 3G data standard. And so</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:53,799 –&gt; 00:01:59,000<br>recall, we have these 16 points with different I and Q values. Well, so if there’s no noise</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:59,000 –&gt; 00:02:04,439<br>in the system, then when a signal arrives, it’s going to be exactly on one of these points.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:04,439 –&gt; 00:02:12,639<br>But in practice, it’s not that there’s some noise the system is introduced. And so let’s</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:12,639 –&gt; 00:02:15,879<br>pretend, for example, that we have some very low noise reception, such that the signal</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:15,879 –&gt; 00:02:20,479<br>strength is much higher than the noise. Then, well, rather than seeing this exact point</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:20,479 –&gt; 00:02:24,960<br>here, we’re going to see something like this. The noise is going to cause the signal to</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:24,960 –&gt; 00:02:33,039<br>get around a bit, but it’s still pretty clear from the constellation that it’s this symbol.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:33,039 –&gt; 00:02:39,240<br>Similarly, if we were receiving this symbol, well, there’s going to be some noise, but because</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:39,240 –&gt; 00:02:44,840<br>the signal is much stronger than the noise, these little jitters aren’t very big, and it’s</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:44,840 –&gt; 00:02:51,480<br>clear that it’s this symbol. But now, what happens if we’re in a higher noise environment?</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:51,480 –&gt; 00:02:56,640<br>What that means is rather than the signal, the received signal, or what we’re going to observe,</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:56,640 –&gt; 00:03:03,560<br>being like this, it might be like this, where the noise causes the received signal to have</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:03,560 –&gt; 00:03:09,039<br>all kinds of different phases and amplitudes than we expect because of this noise in the system.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:09,039 –&gt; 00:03:15,639<br>And fundamentally, this means that there will be some points in which we get, we make</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:15,639 –&gt; 00:03:22,959<br>the wrong conclusion about what this symbol is. So in these cases, for example, while we</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:22,959 –&gt; 00:03:29,120<br>thought we were trying to receive, or system might think it was 0, 0, 1, 1, or 0, 0,</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:29,120 –&gt; 00:03:36,280<br>0, 1, or 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, or 0, 1, 0, 0, 0. So this is how bit errors are introduced.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:36,280 –&gt; 00:03:42,280<br>It’s when your constellation, it’s when the signal to noise ratio is such that some of</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:42,280 –&gt; 00:03:48,599<br>the symbols are misrecorder or misunderstood. And you can imagine if we had had a sparsher</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:48,599 –&gt; 00:03:53,800<br>constellation, like let’s say we only had two points here and here, and this degree of noise</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:53,800 –&gt; 00:03:57,400<br>would have been fine. It wouldn’t have caused us to jump all the way from here over onto</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:57,400 –&gt; 00:04:02,039<br>this side. But for this particular density of constellation, the noise was great enough</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:02,039 –&gt; 00:04:07,280<br>to introduce some bit errors. And so it turns out that there’s a really deep theory on exactly</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:07,280 –&gt; 00:04:10,919<br>how this works and what’s possible and what bit error rates are. And so you can say, given</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:10,919 –&gt; 00:04:15,680<br>for a given modulation scheme and a signal to noise ratio, you can just analytically compute</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:15,680 –&gt; 00:04:20,399<br>what your expected bit error rate is. There’s some mathematical assumptions that are made,</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:20,399 –&gt; 00:04:25,519<br>but this is the bedrock assumption and the bedrock principles of RF communication theory</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:25,519 –&gt; 00:04:30,560<br>that served us so well. What’s important here is that bit error rate can become arbitrarily</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:30,560 –&gt; 00:04:35,519<br>low, but it never reaches zero. The way noise behaves, it’s possible, although very</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:35,519 –&gt; 00:04:39,639<br>very much have this huge spike in noise just for a moment that happens to be at that point,</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:39,639 –&gt; 00:04:46,560<br>a whole bunch of things happen at once. And so the bit error rate never reaches zero. And</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:46,560 –&gt; 00:04:53,639<br>what this sort of turns out in practice is that in general, sending packets just as raw</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:53,639 –&gt; 00:04:59,360<br>bits, like say picking your constellation such that you have the right number of bits</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:59,360 –&gt; 00:05:05,360<br>per symbol and then just directly translating from bits in a packet into bits and symbols</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:05,360 –&gt; 00:05:10,120<br>turns out to rarely be the most efficient way to use the channel. Just because there’s</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:10,120 –&gt; 00:05:15,720<br>this non-zero small probability of bit error. But these show of course is that if you want</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:15,720 –&gt; 00:05:19,920<br>to make that probability very, very low, low enough that it’s unlikely that any bit will</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:19,920 –&gt; 00:05:26,080<br>be an error, well then just due to the way this works, you’re going to be doing much better</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:26,079 –&gt; 00:05:30,240<br>than you need to in general by optimizing for this very, very case of a tiny spike, which</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:30,240 –&gt; 00:05:36,319<br>might occur in any of the bits of your say, you know, 12,000 bit long or 1,500 byte packet.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:36,319 –&gt; 00:05:39,639<br>Many of the bits in terms of the actual symbols in terms of that constellation are doing</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:39,639 –&gt; 00:05:46,560<br>just absolutely great, but you’ve sort of overprotected for this one outlier. And so in</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:46,560 –&gt; 00:05:51,439<br>practice, if you just directly map your bits to the symbols, your system is going to operate</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:51,439 –&gt; 00:05:55,399<br>well, well below the capacity, well, well below the Shannon limit. And so in practice, what</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:55,399 –&gt; 00:06:00,199<br>you do with the physical layer is you take say here are bits, let’s say we have a message</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:00,199 –&gt; 00:06:07,759<br>that says hello. So H-E-L-L-O-O-O-Cama, which are these ASCII values, maps to these bits,</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:07,759 –&gt; 00:06:16,719<br>here are packet, here’s our packet data. Then do is transform this packet data into symbols</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:16,719 –&gt; 00:06:22,000<br>with some amount of redundancy. So some amount of error correcting codes. So the packet will</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:22,000 –&gt; 00:06:27,740<br>actually get a little longer in terms of the number of bits we’re sending at the physical</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:27,740 –&gt; 00:06:38,240<br>layer. So here say we have 48 bits. And we might send in terms of symbols say 60 bits.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:38,240 –&gt; 00:06:43,519<br>So there’s 12 extra bits. We arrange this in something called coding so that if a couple</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:43,519 –&gt; 00:06:47,600<br>of those bits are wrong, we can recover from that and still get the original 48 bits.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:47,600 –&gt; 00:06:52,879<br>So even if there are a couple of bit errors in here, we’ll still receive the packet and</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:52,879 –&gt; 00:06:57,600<br>be able to recover the data just fine. And so this is coding. The idea of adding a little</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:57,600 –&gt; 00:07:01,160<br>bit of redundancy at the physical layer, you can do it anywhere but it’s almost always</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:01,160 –&gt; 00:07:05,200<br>done in the physical layer so the coding is not a physical layer specific idea, to improve</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:05,200 –&gt; 00:07:09,280<br>your linked layer throughput. By adding a bit of redundancy, you could protect against</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:09,280 –&gt; 00:07:14,120<br>a few bit errors or some of which are expected rated bit errors are. And this will in aggregate,</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:14,120 –&gt; 00:07:17,520<br>although you’re making it a bit longer, we’ll improve the throughput of the system.</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:17,519 –&gt; 00:07:22,319<br>This true both in theory and in practice. So turn this off and use his coding gain, which</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:22,319 –&gt; 00:07:26,519<br>is the ratio of bits to the linked layer to the bits of the physical layer. So if you</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:26,519 –&gt; 00:07:31,560<br>hear somebody say one half code, what that means is that if I have a packet that’s n bits</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:31,560 –&gt; 00:07:39,599<br>long at the linked layer, I turn it into two n bits at the physical layer. Or a three</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:39,600 –&gt; 00:07:47,800<br>four code is each three bits, so three n bits become four n bits at the physical layer.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:47,800 –&gt; 00:07:53,640<br>So we have this redundancy so we can correct against some bit errors. So here’s an example</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:53,640 –&gt; 00:08:02,800<br>of a very simple wireless physical layer, 802.15.4, also called ZIGS. Also it’s used in ZIGB.</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:02,800 –&gt; 00:08:10,160<br>802.15.4 uses quadrature phase shift king. And so each one at each actual transmitted symbol</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:10,160 –&gt; 00:08:16,840<br>has two bits. And what 802.154 does is it combines two of these QPSAs, QPSK symbols,</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:16,840 –&gt; 00:08:21,639<br>into a four bit symbol. So it’s what it calls these four bit symbols. There are 16 of them,</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:21,639 –&gt; 00:08:32,720<br>two to the fourth. And each one then maps to 32 QPSK chips. So here it symbols at the</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:32,720 –&gt; 00:08:37,680<br>linked layer and here are symbols at the physical layer. And so we take say four bits at the</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:37,680 –&gt; 00:08:44,720<br>linked layer and turn it into 32 bits at the physical layer, which is 16 QPSK symbols.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:44,720 –&gt; 00:08:49,200<br>And so if I say I want to transmit a packet that has 0001, then actually it’s transmitted</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:49,200 –&gt; 00:08:54,639<br>at the physical layer is this sequence of bits in terms of QPSK symbols.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:54,639 –&gt; 00:08:58,320<br>So we can then figure out what’s the data rate or what’s the symbol rate, what’s going</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:58,800 –&gt; 00:09:05,200<br>on with 802.15.4. So it turns out the bit rate at the linked layer is a high of 250 kilobits per second.</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:05,920 –&gt; 00:09:13,920<br>The coding rate, you have 16 chips of two bits, that’s 32 bits, is that the physical layer</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:13,920 –&gt; 00:09:21,200<br>becomes four bits at the linked layer. So we have what is a one eighth code.</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:22,960 –&gt; 00:09:27,840<br>Four physical layer bits become one linked layer bit, although they’re in clusters of four in 32.</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:28,560 –&gt; 00:09:34,000<br>So based on this, if we are transmitting 250 kilobits per second at the linked layer and we have a</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:34,000 –&gt; 00:09:38,879<br>one eighth code, how many symbols are we transmitting per second? How quickly is 802.15.4</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:38,879 –&gt; 00:09:46,640<br>modulating the signal? Well, each of the symbols has two bits, and it’s this one eighth code.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:46,640 –&gt; 00:09:52,080<br>And so one we’ll look at is that the physical layer, we’re transmitting eight times that</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:52,160 –&gt; 00:10:00,639<br>bits per second. So eight times 250 kilobits per second, which is equal to two mega bits per second.</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:01,759 –&gt; 00:10:09,040<br>At the physical layer, since each symboled physical layer has two bits, this means that 802.15.4</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:09,040 –&gt; 00:10:18,560<br>transmits one million symbols per second, or in other ways each symbol is one micro second.</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:19,279 –&gt; 00:10:27,519<br>So let’s look at a more modern or sort of a more advanced physical layer. So this is what 802.11.n,</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:27,519 –&gt; 00:10:33,439<br>very reasonably recent Wi-Fi standard, uses. So most Wi-Fi stuff you buy today is 802.11.n.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:34,399 –&gt; 00:10:39,439<br>And so it turns out there’s all these different schemes it can use, but here’s just a subset of them.</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:39,439 –&gt; 00:10:44,559<br>And so you can see for these eight, there’s a bunch of different modulations, BPSK, binary fish</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:44,559 –&gt; 00:10:51,759<br>of king, quadrature fish of king, 16 quam, 64 quam, different coding gains. So one half,</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:51,759 –&gt; 00:10:57,839<br>one half, three quarter, one half, five sixth. And from that, you can then figure out, given the</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:57,839 –&gt; 00:11:02,399<br>data rate, here’s the actual data rate in mega bits per second. Here are the different data rates</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:02,399 –&gt; 00:11:07,199<br>of these physical layer supports. So for example, if you’re using MCX, index seven, this is with</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:07,759 –&gt; 00:11:14,399<br>determination, the standard of what the coding system is, we can get up to 150 mega bits per second.</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:14,639 –&gt; 00:11:18,159<br>And that’s if you’re using a 64 quam constellation with a five sixth coding.</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:20,319 –&gt; 00:11:26,319<br>As you notice here, that there’s these different channels. Remember that the data that we get is also</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:26,319 –&gt; 00:11:30,559<br>not only the signal to noise ratio, but is also based on the channel. And so here with the 20 mega</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:30,559 –&gt; 00:11:36,159<br>hertz versus 40 megahertz channel, you can see with the 40 megahertz channel, we’re a little better</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:36,159 –&gt; 00:11:41,439<br>than twice as fast. The reason why we’re a little better is because these time values are fixed.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:41,680 –&gt; 00:11:46,480<br>And so these things are fixed. We can do a little bit better than half. If there were no time values,</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:46,480 –&gt; 00:11:51,280<br>it would be directly half plus there’s also some guards. But so you can see generally, double the</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:51,280 –&gt; 00:11:57,520<br>channel. You’re just about doubling the throughput. So in overview, we want to talk about chips which</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:57,520 –&gt; 00:12:01,680<br>are down at the physical layer, the representation of the single physical layer versus bits, which is</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:01,680 –&gt; 00:12:05,280<br>the representation of the link layer. The link layer has a whole bunch of bits and then pass them</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:05,280 –&gt; 00:12:09,840<br>down the physical layer. They’re turned into chips. Now, physical layer has to deal with noise. It’s an</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:09,840 –&gt; 00:12:14,160<br>actual physical medium noise from the hardware circuits from the environment, et cetera. This can</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:14,160 –&gt; 00:12:19,680<br>cause chip errors. If you have a denser modulation, then you can have higher throughput because you</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:19,680 –&gt; 00:12:24,560<br>can represent more bits per symbol. But a denser modulation is less robust to noise because</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:24,560 –&gt; 00:12:29,759<br>it’s just the distance between the different symbols. And so a sparse modulation has fewer errors.</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:29,759 –&gt; 00:12:34,800<br>So a big tension is what exactly is the modulation used. We saw in 802 11n, there’s a bunch of different</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:34,799 –&gt; 00:12:39,599<br>modulations that are used for different signals and noise ratios, which give you different actual</p>
<p>136<br>00:12:39,599 –&gt; 00:12:45,039<br>throughputs. So now, how do you translate between these link layer bits and physical layer bits? It</p>
<p>137<br>00:12:45,039 –&gt; 00:12:50,799<br>turns out to just a one-to-one mapping is a rarely good idea. It might be the most efficient in terms</p>
<p>138<br>00:12:50,799 –&gt; 00:12:56,399<br>of just raw bits. But the problem is that the probability of bit errors mean you want some redundancy.</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:56,399 –&gt; 00:13:00,799<br>That’s rarely going to let you get close to the shannon capacity. So you talk about something called</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:00,799 –&gt; 00:13:07,919<br>a coding gain, which is the layer 2 to layer 1 ratio. And because layer 1 will represent each bit</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:07,919 –&gt; 00:13:13,679<br>at the link layer with more than one bit at its layer, you can recover from some chip errors.</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:13,679 –&gt; 00:13:19,120<br>So we saw an example 802 11n where you see anything from a 1 half coding gain to a 5-6th coding</p>
<p>143<br>00:13:19,120 –&gt; 00:13:25,039<br>gain under all kinds of different constellations ranging from BPSK, binary phase shift king to 64 quam,</p>
<p>144<br>00:13:25,039 –&gt; 00:13:27,120<br>64 quadratory amplitude modulation.</p>
