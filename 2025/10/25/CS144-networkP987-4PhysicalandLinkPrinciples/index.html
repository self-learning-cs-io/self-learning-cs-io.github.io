                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,639<br>So in this video about the physical and link layers, I’m going to talk about forward error correction or FEC.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,639 –&gt; 00:00:08,080<br>So I’ve called it for a given signal noise ratio, a modulation scheme.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,080 –&gt; 00:00:11,040<br>We can compute what the expected bid error rate is.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:11,040 –&gt; 00:00:16,240<br>Now this bid error rate, well it can become very, very small for say a very high signal strength.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:16,240 –&gt; 00:00:20,240<br>It will never read zero. There’s always a chance that there will be a bid error.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:20,240 –&gt; 00:00:25,679<br>So in practice what this means is that because these bid errors, although uncommon,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:25,679 –&gt; 00:00:31,439<br>you expect them to happen, directly turning your link layer bits into bits that the physical</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:31,439 –&gt; 00:00:36,640<br>layer is very, very inefficient in that the sparsity of the modulation need or the speed of the</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:36,640 –&gt; 00:00:41,840<br>symbols that you need in order to have a very, very low bid error rates that packet bid errors are</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:41,840 –&gt; 00:00:46,399<br>uncommon is really, really inefficient. It’s going to be very, very far from the Shannon limit.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,399 –&gt; 00:00:48,719<br>That’s not a good way to build a high throughput system.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:50,799 –&gt; 00:00:55,600<br>So instead, what you want to do is coding. So coding is a way where you add a little</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:55,600 –&gt; 00:00:59,679<br>bit of redundancy to the data. In this case, we’re talking about the physical error, which you can do in</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:59,679 –&gt; 00:01:05,840<br>all kinds of situations. So you add a little bit of redundancy to make up for these expected,</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:05,840 –&gt; 00:01:12,960<br>uncommon bid errors. And in adding in this little bit of redundancy, its cost is much, much smaller</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:12,960 –&gt; 00:01:17,040<br>than its benefit. By doing this, you can greatly, greatly improve your link throughput. Because</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:17,040 –&gt; 00:01:20,560<br>just by adding a little bit of redundancy, all your packets get through as opposed to almost</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:20,560 –&gt; 00:01:25,040<br>nine of your packets get through. And this true in theory as well as practice. So we talk about coding.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:25,040 –&gt; 00:01:29,520<br>We also talk about coding gain, which is the ratio of bits. In this case, the link error</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:29,520 –&gt; 00:01:32,800<br>to the bits, the physical error. Coding gains are general in that, but within networks,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:32,800 –&gt; 00:01:37,680<br>usually we’re talking about the physical error and the link error. So one half code means that we</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:37,680 –&gt; 00:01:42,560<br>turn one link error bet into two physical error bits. So there’s one redundant bit for every bit.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:42,560 –&gt; 00:01:46,480<br>Three quarter code, if you turn three link error bits into four bits at the physical error.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:47,280 –&gt; 00:01:51,120<br>And this process is forward error correction. The idea is,</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:51,200 –&gt; 00:01:57,680<br>peractively add some additional redundant data to protect, to retract and be able to correct</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:57,680 –&gt; 00:02:01,439<br>potential errors. It’s called forward error correction because you’re doing it peractively.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:01,439 –&gt; 00:02:05,840<br>Four, you’re saying, look, I don’t know if you’re going to have any errors, but beforehand,</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:05,840 –&gt; 00:02:09,439<br>I’m just going to add a bit of redundancies that you can recover from them. This is nice because</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:09,439 –&gt; 00:02:13,120<br>you don’t need any exchanges. The recipient will be able to just decode the data. It’s not going</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:13,120 –&gt; 00:02:18,159<br>to have to say, oh, there was an error. Can you resend this part? And so it saves you the cost</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:18,159 –&gt; 00:02:22,319<br>of those kinds of messages and changes. So how do you do this? Well, there’s all kinds of coding</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:22,319 –&gt; 00:02:26,960<br>algorithms out there. There’s lots of different ones, all kinds of different trade-offs. Here’s</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:26,960 –&gt; 00:02:32,960<br>just a couple of them. So in this video, I’m going to talk about one in particular, read Solomon.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:33,680 –&gt; 00:02:37,359<br>So I’m going to talk about read Solomon because it turns out compared to many of these others,</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:37,359 –&gt; 00:02:43,680<br>it’s actually mathematically pretty simple. It’s also tremendously commonly used. CDs use read</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:43,680 –&gt; 00:02:51,840<br>Solomon DVDs, DSL lines, Y-Max, RAID 6 storage arrays, all of these systems, all of these communication</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:51,840 –&gt; 00:02:57,680<br>storage systems you’d read Solomon. Further, we’re compared to some of these other coding algorithms.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:57,680 –&gt; 00:03:02,000<br>Read Solomon is actually pretty mathematically simple. I’m not going to go into all of the details.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:03,040 –&gt; 00:03:09,040<br>The basic concept is simple actually designing it so that you can implement it very fast,</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:09,040 –&gt; 00:03:12,879<br>involves a bit more math which I won’t go into, but the basic concept is very simple.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:12,879 –&gt; 00:03:18,079<br>The key idea behind read Solomon is that if I have a polynomial, like here, a polynomial,</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:18,079 –&gt; 00:03:24,799<br>like here, where I have a parabola, right? So I have some AX squared plus BX plus C.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:26,000 –&gt; 00:03:29,199<br>Then any polynomial of degree K, or here K equals two,</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:31,599 –&gt; 00:03:38,400<br>is uniquely determined by K plus one points. So that means is that if I give you three,</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:39,360 –&gt; 00:03:48,960<br>X, Y points, so three X, Y points will uniquely determine for a parabola A, B, and C.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:51,200 –&gt; 00:03:57,120<br>So why is this useful? So what I can do is I have some data that I want to encode with read Solomon.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:57,120 –&gt; 00:04:03,759<br>So I take K chunks of this data. These K chunks become coefficients of a K minus one degree</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:03,840 –&gt; 00:04:10,719<br>polynomial. So for example, I take three chunks of data and those three chunks become A, B, and C.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:10,719 –&gt; 00:04:18,159<br>These three coefficients. Then what I do is I compute N points along this polynomial,</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:18,719 –&gt; 00:04:23,199<br>where N is greater than or equal to K minus one. So it should be minus one.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:25,199 –&gt; 00:04:30,879<br>So I compute these N points and that’s what I send. I send those points along the polynomial.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:31,839 –&gt; 00:04:39,120<br>Now what happens is I’m sending N points, but because the original polynomial is of degree K minus one,</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:40,719 –&gt; 00:04:46,159<br>any of those K points, where K is less than N, would allow you to uniquely and correctly</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:46,159 –&gt; 00:04:52,560<br>determine what these coefficients were. So for example, I have a second degree polynomial,</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:52,560 –&gt; 00:04:59,680<br>which I generated from three chunks of data, A, B, and C. Then what I do is I compute 0.0, 0.1,</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:00,480 –&gt; 00:05:13,680<br>0.2, say 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6. And I send P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6. Now it turns out that</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:13,680 –&gt; 00:05:19,600<br>with any of these three points, right, with P1, P5, and P6, or with P4, P1, and P3,</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:20,399 –&gt; 00:05:25,199<br>you can, if you know this is a parabola, you can determine what A, B, and C are.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:26,079 –&gt; 00:05:32,079<br>So that’s the basic math. I compute points along a polynomial whose coefficients are the original data.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:32,959 –&gt; 00:05:37,920<br>And then if I’m able to recover enough for those points of the polynomial, I can reconstitute</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:37,920 –&gt; 00:05:43,759<br>what those coefficients were. There’s some complications to this. I can’t just like P2,</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:43,759 –&gt; 00:05:47,199<br>can’t be a million because how I represent a million, it’s going to take up more space.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:48,560 –&gt; 00:05:53,439<br>There’s some complications where the actual numbers you use aren’t just basic integers. There</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:53,439 –&gt; 00:05:58,560<br>are things, numbers on a finite field, which means sort of a mathematical construct where it’s closed</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:58,560 –&gt; 00:06:04,480<br>over operations. Which essentially means that hey, I can represent each of these points in a finite</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:04,480 –&gt; 00:06:11,279<br>number of bits. It’s not like suddenly A is a million, and then that means that P6 is something</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:11,279 –&gt; 00:06:16,480<br>totally off the charts. And I can’t represent it in a finite space. And so that’s one of the other</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:16,480 –&gt; 00:06:22,319<br>complications that I’m not going to go into. But this is the basic idea. Is that I represent the data</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:22,319 –&gt; 00:06:27,519<br>as coefficients of a polynomial? I compute points along the polynomial. Then I sand those points.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:28,480 –&gt; 00:06:32,159<br>And then the other side from those points can reconstitute the coefficients. Now a little bit</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:32,159 –&gt; 00:06:37,120<br>more detail in terms of what read Solomon can do for you. So it turns out in these kinds of systems,</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:37,120 –&gt; 00:06:40,800<br>there are two kinds of errors we care about. And it’s important to distinguish them. The first</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:40,800 –&gt; 00:06:46,240<br>are erasers. So these are errors we know that they occurred. Like that piece of data is missing.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:46,240 –&gt; 00:06:51,039<br>That’s an erasure. The other is a general error. We don’t know that where the error occurs. This is</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:51,040 –&gt; 00:06:55,439<br>what we normally think of in terms of say bit errors. Whereas erasced values are say, oh gosh,</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:55,439 –&gt; 00:07:00,640<br>this disdaincer. Oh, we missed that packet. And so what read Solomon does is you’re taking K</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:00,640 –&gt; 00:07:04,560<br>chunks of data and you’re coding into n chunks where n is greater than or equal to K.</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:05,280 –&gt; 00:07:10,160<br>Worth n is equal to K. You’re not actually doing any coding. And what read Solomon will do is</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:10,160 –&gt; 00:07:17,759<br>he can correct up to n minus K erasers. Because remember, if we code into n chunks, if we have K points</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:17,759 –&gt; 00:07:21,599<br>and we know those K points are correct, which is missing the others, we can reconstitute the data.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:22,240 –&gt; 00:07:28,480<br>But it can also correct up to n minus K divided by two errors. So let’s say we have a very common</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:28,480 –&gt; 00:07:38,480<br>read Solomon code is 223 255, which means that we take 223 bytes of data and turn into 255 coded</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:38,480 –&gt; 00:07:46,719<br>bytes of data. Well, 255 minus 223 is equal to 32. So I mean this particular read Solomon code</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:48,079 –&gt; 00:07:59,360<br>can protect against 32 erasers or 16 errors. We’re 32 of the 8-bit code words can be missing. As</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:59,360 –&gt; 00:08:04,319<br>long as we’ve got 223, we can reconstitute the original data. That’s 223 points on our 222</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:04,319 –&gt; 00:08:11,839<br>degree polynomial. Or if 16 of them are have bit errors in them, we can still reconstitute the</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:12,799 –&gt; 00:08:19,679<br>original data. So here’s that conceptually. Let’s take 223 8-bit values. So we’ve take our data,</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:21,519 –&gt; 00:08:26,319<br>break it into bytes, take 223 bytes, and we’re going to consider those now the coefficients of a</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:26,319 –&gt; 00:08:33,839<br>222 degree polynomial p within compute p of 0, p of 1, p of 2, etc, etc, etc. As 8-bit values,</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:33,839 –&gt; 00:08:39,120<br>there’s this again, this idea of using a field rather than arbitrary numbers. There’s that mathematical</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:39,200 –&gt; 00:08:46,799<br>concept. Obviously, we can then represent them as 8-bit values. We then send these 255, 255 points</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:46,799 –&gt; 00:08:53,600<br>along the polynomial. And so this is a 255 to 23 code. Each of these 255 code words come from</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:53,600 –&gt; 00:09:00,720<br>223 data words, 32 racers, 16 errors. So we send these 255 values. And that’s the basic idea is</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:00,720 –&gt; 00:09:05,919<br>that if I have up to 16 errors, I can still figure out which ones are wrong and I can reconstitute</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:05,919 –&gt; 00:09:10,479<br>the polynomial. I can reconstitute the polynomial coefficients or I can be missing 32 of them.</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:10,479 –&gt; 00:09:15,839<br>As long as I get 223, if I have 32 racers, I can still reconstitute the original polynomial.</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:16,799 –&gt; 00:09:22,639<br>So I said before, this isn’t exactly what’s done in practice for a bunch of reasons. These values</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:22,639 –&gt; 00:09:28,159<br>have to be in a concept called a field. It turns out that this exact scheme is actually pretty</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:28,159 –&gt; 00:09:33,839<br>expensive to decode, you have to consider all possible parameters and do an interpolation.</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:34,560 –&gt; 00:09:39,600<br>But it’s giving you the basic idea. The more modern ones are a bit more complex, but the basic idea</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:39,600 –&gt; 00:09:44,879<br>holds of you using the original data as coefficients on a polynomial, computing points along the</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:44,879 –&gt; 00:09:51,600<br>polynomial, and then sending those points. So here is a simple example. I take these six bytes that say</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:51,600 –&gt; 00:09:57,519<br>hello. I’m breaking them into chunks of data. I then do my read Solomon coding here.</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:58,399 –&gt; 00:10:05,120<br>Here is the basic concept. I’m adding my four-dare correction here, some redundant data.</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:06,159 –&gt; 00:10:12,159<br>Then when that data arrives, I can decode it and get the original data.</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:12,159 –&gt; 00:10:16,960<br>So let’s walk through this as a specific example. So in this case, let’s say we’re using a 7.5 code.</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:17,519 –&gt; 00:10:22,639<br>What this means is that each initial data word that we’re going to use is three bits long.</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:22,639 –&gt; 00:10:28,159<br>That’s determined by the 7, 2, and the 3 minus 1. So we’re breaking the data up into little chunks</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:28,159 –&gt; 00:10:34,399<br>of three bits. And so we’re going to start with five of these data words, so 15 bits.</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:34,399 –&gt; 00:10:39,120<br>And each 15 bits are going to be turned into seven code words. So here we have the first 15 bits,</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:39,120 –&gt; 00:10:44,159<br>the next 15 bits, the next 15 bits. So it turns out we have 48 bits here. 48 is not evenly</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:44,159 –&gt; 00:10:50,639<br>divisible by 15. So we have 45 plus 3. So just pad this with zeros. So original data is going to</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:50,639 –&gt; 00:10:57,439<br>grow from 48 to 60 bits. We then perform the read Solomon coding to turn these 15 bits</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:59,120 –&gt; 00:11:09,199<br>into 21 bits. And then send these total of 84 bits along, say, the wire or on the wireless.</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:09,919 –&gt; 00:11:15,759<br>Those 84 bits are transmitted, received, the other side gets these 84 coded bits,</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:15,759 –&gt; 00:11:22,240<br>then runs a read Solomon decoder, and from that can regenerate the original data.</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:24,960 –&gt; 00:11:32,799<br>So since this is a 7.5 code, that means that we can recover from one error or two erasers.</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:35,360 –&gt; 00:11:41,519<br>We note that these errors and erasers are for code words. And so it’s possible, in fact,</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:41,519 –&gt; 00:11:45,199<br>that if we have, let’s say we have bit errors that look like this, here’s a bit error,</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:46,159 –&gt; 00:11:52,159<br>here’s a bit error, here are two bit errors. Can I ask the question, will we be able to recover</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:52,159 –&gt; 00:11:58,559<br>from these bit errors? So for this first code block, the answer is yes, there’s a single bit error.</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:58,559 –&gt; 00:12:04,879<br>A single bit error will corrupt at most one code word. We can recover from one error,</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:04,879 –&gt; 00:12:10,720<br>one code word with an error. And so this first block will be able to successfully recover.</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:11,840 –&gt; 00:12:22,399<br>The same with the second code block. We have one bit error, that means one code will be an error,</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:22,399 –&gt; 00:12:29,039<br>so we can recover from that. For the third code block, well, this is a tricky question.</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:29,919 –&gt; 00:12:37,360<br>So one of our code words can be an error, and we have two bit errors. This now depends on where</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:37,440 –&gt; 00:12:43,840<br>those bit errors fall. Let’s say here are code words spaced out, here’s two, three, four, five,</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:43,840 –&gt; 00:12:48,720<br>six, seven. Let’s say they look like this. Well, if the two bit errors</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:51,279 –&gt; 00:12:56,080<br>are in the same code word, then we’ll be okay, because we just have one error, one code word with an</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:57,040 –&gt; 00:13:00,720<br>error. So in that case, we’ll be all right. However,</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:06,720 –&gt; 00:13:13,840<br>if the bit errors are in different code words, then we’ll not be all right. We’ll have two errors,</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:13,840 –&gt; 00:13:24,160<br>we can’t recover from two error. So this might not seem very good, but compared to what happens if</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:24,159 –&gt; 00:13:29,279<br>we were not to use any coding whatsoever, here we’ve been able to protect against at least two</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:29,279 –&gt; 00:13:39,039<br>bit errors, and maybe even up to four. So there’s one other trick that you can use. This is very</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:39,039 –&gt; 00:13:43,600<br>common, this for example is done in CDs. So one of the assumptions people you often have is that</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:43,600 –&gt; 00:13:48,399<br>errors in the physical layer, some of them are just interspersed in random, those are easy to handle,</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:48,399 –&gt; 00:13:54,480<br>what’s harder burst severe errors. And so the way you can make your coding scheme more robust</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:54,480 –&gt; 00:14:00,319<br>burst severe errors is through some of the called interleaving. So imagine, for example, I have,</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:00,319 –&gt; 00:14:05,360<br>here’s my data, and there’s 12 chunks of a seven five code. So that means that each of these chunks</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:05,360 –&gt; 00:14:12,159<br>is in terms of the coded data, is 21 bits long, remember from the prior showing its seven code words</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:12,159 –&gt; 00:14:20,319<br>that are three bits long each. And so here I have 12 code blocks from A to L with bits A0 to</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:20,319 –&gt; 00:14:27,439<br>A20 and say L0 to L20. So let’s think about what happens with a burst of errors. So it’s possible</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:28,319 –&gt; 00:14:34,879<br>with let’s say a burst of one error. Well, I know for sure I’m going to recover from that,</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:34,879 –&gt; 00:14:40,319<br>because that’s going to corrupt at most one code word in one block, and I can recover from one error.</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:40,320 –&gt; 00:14:42,720<br>So that will be okay. One bit error.</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:52,480 –&gt; 00:15:02,960<br>I’m okay. How about two bit errors? Well, again, call it’s going to matter on whether they fall</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:02,960 –&gt; 00:15:10,240<br>in the same code word, or if they say fall on different code words. In fact, it’s possible that</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:10,240 –&gt; 00:15:17,279<br>it could each fall on a burst of two errors. One falls on a code word in one block. That block</p>
<p>149<br>00:15:17,279 –&gt; 00:15:21,759<br>can be recovered. Another falls on a code word in another block. That can be recovered. We would be</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:21,759 –&gt; 00:15:33,039<br>okay. So in this case, we would be okay. If they both fell within a single code word, we would be okay.</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:34,000 –&gt; 00:15:41,919<br>But if they fell on two different code words within the same block, then we won’t be able to</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:41,919 –&gt; 00:15:47,199<br>recover from that. There will be two errors within a single block. In fact, it turns out if we were to</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:47,199 –&gt; 00:15:54,480<br>look at what’s the longest string of bit errors that we could possibly recover from. That’s a good</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:54,480 –&gt; 00:16:05,920<br>question. So it turns out that the longest that we can recover from is six bit errors.</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:08,399 –&gt; 00:16:15,120<br>And we can recover from a burst of six bit errors if and only if it happens to be that three of them</p>
<p>156<br>00:16:15,120 –&gt; 00:16:23,200<br>fall on the last code word of one block, and then three fall on the first code word of the next block.</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:23,200 –&gt; 00:16:27,440<br>You can imagine if we add one more, it’s going to crop to second code word. So that is possible,</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:27,440 –&gt; 00:16:32,879<br>but unlikely. So this is the longest possible string of errors we could correct from using just a</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:32,879 –&gt; 00:16:39,280<br>basic coding. So what we can do instead is something called interleaving. So rather than send our data</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:39,280 –&gt; 00:16:45,200<br>as a through a zero through a 20 b through b 20 within a burst of errors is concentrated on a block,</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:45,200 –&gt; 00:16:49,120<br>instead, what we send is these bits interleaved.</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:05,519 –&gt; 00:17:13,039<br>For example, we send a zero b zero c zero d zero, etc, etc, to L zero a one b one c one dot dot dot</p>
<p>163<br>00:17:13,119 –&gt; 00:17:19,279<br>to L one. Then at the end, we’re going to send k 20 L 20. And so now it happens that a burst of</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:19,279 –&gt; 00:17:26,799<br>errors the physical layer is spread out across all of the different code blocks. So in this case,</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:26,799 –&gt; 00:17:35,359<br>if we have even a string of 12 bit errors, a string of 12 bit errors is going to do cause one bit error</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:35,359 –&gt; 00:17:39,440<br>on every single one of the code blocks. So it’ll cause one bit R and a one bit R and b one bit R and</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:39,440 –&gt; 00:17:44,480<br>c one bit R and l. And so in that way, we’re suddenly become more robust with interleaving by</p>
<p>168<br>00:17:44,480 –&gt; 00:17:53,120<br>interleaving all of these bits. We can recover up to 12 bit errors with interleaving.</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:58,960 –&gt; 00:18:03,759<br>Where even when we didn’t have interleaving, even two bit errors can cause our system to fail.</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:03,759 –&gt; 00:18:07,680<br>And six bit errors the most we could ever do. But if all we do is interleave these bits,</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:07,680 –&gt; 00:18:13,759<br>we can deterministically, knowingly, recover a burst up to 12 bits long. So interleaving is a very</p>
<p>172<br>00:18:13,759 –&gt; 00:18:20,000<br>common and a very popular technique. So this concludes the video on coding. If you want to read more,</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:20,000 –&gt; 00:18:24,320<br>there’s all kinds of interesting coding out there. I also suggest if you want, dig into the</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:24,320 –&gt; 00:18:30,480<br>math read Solomon in terms of how it works in practice to make efficient coding and decoding.</p>
