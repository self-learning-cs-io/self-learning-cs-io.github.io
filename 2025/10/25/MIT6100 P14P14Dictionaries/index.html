                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:13,339<br>All right, everyone.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:13,339 –&gt; 00:00:15,040<br>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,040 –&gt; 00:00:18,440<br>So today’s lecture will be on this thing called dictionaries.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,440 –&gt; 00:00:22,640<br>And it’s not the dictionaries that our parents and grandparents used.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,640 –&gt; 00:00:29,640<br>Notice I never actually used regular book dictionaries either, maybe once in my entire life.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,640 –&gt; 00:00:32,119<br>But it’s actually on a Python dictionary.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,119 –&gt; 00:00:37,079<br>So this is going to be a new data type that we have not worked with before.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:37,079 –&gt; 00:00:41,799<br>But it’ll be a compound data type much like we’ve seen lists and tuples to be.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,799 –&gt; 00:00:46,039<br>It’s just going to be very different than lists and tuples.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:46,039 –&gt; 00:00:53,480<br>So before I introduce a bunch of syntax and what a Python dictionary is,</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:53,480 –&gt; 00:00:58,280<br>let’s try to just motivate the need for such a data structure.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:58,280 –&gt; 00:01:00,840<br>So suppose we have the following problem.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:00,840 –&gt; 00:01:04,439<br>We’ve been dealing with this problem in many of our lectures.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:04,439 –&gt; 00:01:09,200<br>But we once again want to store student information.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:09,200 –&gt; 00:01:15,680<br>So let’s say we want to store great information for a bunch of students.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,680 –&gt; 00:01:20,520<br>With what we know so far, we can store information using lists.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:20,520 –&gt; 00:01:25,280<br>It’s a very reasonable data structure to use because we might get new students in the class.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:25,280 –&gt; 00:01:27,879<br>Students might drop, grades might change, things like that.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:27,879 –&gt; 00:01:31,479<br>So let’s use this mutable data structure list.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:31,479 –&gt; 00:01:36,840<br>Let’s say we want to store names of students and their grades in the class,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:36,840 –&gt; 00:01:38,319<br>like their final letter grade.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:38,319 –&gt; 00:01:42,640<br>Additionally, we can store things like micro quiz grades and p-sets grades.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:42,640 –&gt; 00:01:46,519<br>But for now, let’s just assume we’re storing just the names and the final grades in the class.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:46,519 –&gt; 00:01:51,759<br>So if we do this using lists, one reasonable way to store this information is by saying,</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:51,759 –&gt; 00:01:55,280<br>well, I’m going to have a list of all the names of the students in my class.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:55,280 –&gt; 00:01:58,760<br>I’m going to have a list of all the grades of these students in the class.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:58,760 –&gt; 00:02:04,799<br>And I’m basically going to go index by index and make the rule that says,</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:04,799 –&gt; 00:02:09,159<br>at a particular index, I’m storing all the information related to this one person.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:09,159 –&gt; 00:02:11,000<br>So I have index zero here.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:11,000 –&gt; 00:02:14,240<br>I’m storing the name of the student and their grade.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:14,240 –&gt; 00:02:18,639<br>At index one, I’m storing the name of that student, John, and their grade.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:18,639 –&gt; 00:02:22,000<br>At index two, I’m storing the name of that student and their grade.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:22,000 –&gt; 00:02:24,240<br>And at index three and so on and so on.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:24,240 –&gt; 00:02:28,320<br>So I now basically have to remember that for a particular index,</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:28,320 –&gt; 00:02:34,200<br>I am storing all the information related to that student.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:34,200 –&gt; 00:02:39,040<br>Okay, so seems like a reasonable way to do this.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:39,040 –&gt; 00:02:44,200<br>Now let’s say that I want it to look up the grade for a particular student.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:44,200 –&gt; 00:02:48,280<br>So I write this function called get grade.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:48,280 –&gt; 00:02:49,719<br>It takes in some parameters.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:49,719 –&gt; 00:02:52,680<br>So the first thing it’ll take in is the name of the student.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:52,680 –&gt; 00:02:58,159<br>So Anna, for example, and I would pass in the list of all the names in my class</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:58,159 –&gt; 00:02:59,960<br>and the list of all the grades in the class.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:59,960 –&gt; 00:03:03,520<br>So these are these two lists that I’ve previously created.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:03,520 –&gt; 00:03:05,920<br>So these get passed in to this function.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:05,920 –&gt; 00:03:08,599<br>So you can imagine if we have a list of everybody at MIT,</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:08,599 –&gt; 00:03:13,159<br>these lists are going to be pretty large that we’re passing in as parameters.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:13,159 –&gt; 00:03:17,480<br>How do we actually grab the letter grade associated with a student?</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:17,480 –&gt; 00:03:21,680<br>Well, we’re going to use the fact that the letter grade for the student</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:21,680 –&gt; 00:03:31,599<br>at index i is in the grade list is going to be grabbing the letter grade</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:31,599 –&gt; 00:03:34,599<br>for the student at that same index in the name list.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:34,599 –&gt; 00:03:39,240<br>Okay, so we have to figure out this particular student being passed in here,</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:39,240 –&gt; 00:03:42,840<br>what index they’re at in the names list.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:42,840 –&gt; 00:03:44,640<br>So that’s what this line of code is doing.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:44,640 –&gt; 00:03:50,400<br>It’s using this index function on the name list with a parameter,</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:50,400 –&gt; 00:03:51,879<br>for example, Anna.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:51,879 –&gt; 00:03:56,960<br>So this will return for us the index where Anna is in my list.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:56,960 –&gt; 00:04:02,920<br>So from the previous example, it’s going to say that it’s going to turn the number zero</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:02,920 –&gt; 00:04:07,080<br>because Anna is stored in the name list at index zero.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:07,080 –&gt; 00:04:10,920<br>So now that I have that index in hand, sort of variable i,</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:10,920 –&gt; 00:04:14,920<br>I can just index into the grade list at that same index.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:14,920 –&gt; 00:04:19,439<br>Okay, so I can get grades list at index zero will return from either grade</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:19,439 –&gt; 00:04:24,639<br>that I got for that particular class or whatever we’re storing here.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:24,639 –&gt; 00:04:28,439<br>Okay, and then we just return the two-pole student comma grade.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:28,439 –&gt; 00:04:30,759<br>So this becomes really messy, right?</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:30,759 –&gt; 00:04:34,000<br>I already mentioned that if I have a list of a whole bunch of students</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:34,000 –&gt; 00:04:37,600<br>for a really large class or, you know, the entire university,</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:37,600 –&gt; 00:04:42,079<br>then it becomes really unwieldy to just keep passing in all these lists.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:42,079 –&gt; 00:04:46,800<br>If I have, in addition, all these micro quiz lists and all these problem-set lists</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:46,840 –&gt; 00:04:49,600<br>that also store additional information for the student,</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:49,600 –&gt; 00:04:53,600<br>I then have to pass those in for their respective functions.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:53,600 –&gt; 00:04:56,439<br>And so it gets really messy, right?</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:56,439 –&gt; 00:04:59,639<br>Writing these functions that retrieve this information.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:59,639 –&gt; 00:05:03,400<br>And additionally, if we’re mutating these lists like if a new student comes in</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:03,400 –&gt; 00:05:05,160<br>and we need to add all their information,</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:05,160 –&gt; 00:05:08,840<br>I need to make sure to update every single one of these lists that I’m maintaining.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:08,840 –&gt; 00:05:11,519<br>If a student leaves, right, or drops the class,</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:11,519 –&gt; 00:05:16,080<br>I need to remember to remove that index from all of these different lists.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:16,079 –&gt; 00:05:20,879<br>So really, really messy situation that we could get into by using this method</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:20,879 –&gt; 00:05:24,919<br>to store information about students.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:24,919 –&gt; 00:05:27,399<br>So let’s try a different approach.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:27,399 –&gt; 00:05:30,360<br>Instead of using all of these different lists,</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:30,360 –&gt; 00:05:34,560<br>let’s say that we’re going to store everything in a master list.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:34,560 –&gt; 00:05:36,479<br>So we’re not storing many lists.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:36,479 –&gt; 00:05:39,560<br>We’ll just store one list for the grades in the class.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:39,560 –&gt; 00:05:43,399<br>And the way that it’ll be stored, according to this,</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:43,399 –&gt; 00:05:46,919<br>in the slide is going to be this grades list.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:46,919 –&gt; 00:05:49,839<br>So this is one list with three elements in it.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:49,839 –&gt; 00:05:51,799<br>And you can imagine if we have more students,</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:51,799 –&gt; 00:05:55,439<br>we would just put all these students in this master list.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:55,439 –&gt; 00:06:00,599<br>So what is each one of these student elements?</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:00,599 –&gt; 00:06:03,159<br>Well, each student element is itself a list.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:03,159 –&gt; 00:06:05,479<br>So already I’ve got my master list,</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:05,479 –&gt; 00:06:08,519<br>and each element within this list is also a list.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:08,519 –&gt; 00:06:11,159<br>So this is a list for Eric, a list for Anna,</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:11,160 –&gt; 00:06:12,240<br>and a list for John.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:12,240 –&gt; 00:06:14,720<br>These are variable names.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:14,720 –&gt; 00:06:17,720<br>What are these lists going to be comprised of?</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:17,720 –&gt; 00:06:20,000<br>Well, they will be comprised of three things.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:20,000 –&gt; 00:06:22,480<br>So notice, right, two commas here.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:22,480 –&gt; 00:06:24,480<br>So the first thing is their name.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:24,480 –&gt; 00:06:27,960<br>The second thing is another list containing their problem</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:27,960 –&gt; 00:06:29,040<br>set grades.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:29,040 –&gt; 00:06:33,320<br>And I’m kind of using this element of that list</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:33,320 –&gt; 00:06:36,960<br>to denote what that set of numbers represents.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:36,960 –&gt; 00:06:40,240<br>And then another list as my third element,</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:40,240 –&gt; 00:06:43,120<br>being for the micro, being the scores for the micro quiz grades.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:43,120 –&gt; 00:06:46,960<br>And again, I’m denoting the first element of that list,</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:46,960 –&gt; 00:06:50,920<br>telling me what this list contains.</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:50,920 –&gt; 00:06:55,960<br>OK, so I’ve got master list with three sublists</p>
<p>110<br>00:06:55,960 –&gt; 00:06:57,040<br>for my three students.</p>
<p>111<br>00:06:57,040 –&gt; 00:06:59,319<br>And each one of those lists contains three elements,</p>
<p>112<br>00:06:59,319 –&gt; 00:07:01,120<br>a string, a list, and another list.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:01,120 –&gt; 00:07:05,439<br>And those two lists are then also comprised of a string</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:05,439 –&gt; 00:07:06,800<br>and a list themselves.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:06,800 –&gt; 00:07:10,199<br>So super complex, a data structure,</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:10,199 –&gt; 00:07:12,120<br>a sort of composition or design choice</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:12,120 –&gt; 00:07:13,960<br>that I’ve made here.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:13,960 –&gt; 00:07:17,319<br>But it solves the problem of maintaining</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:17,319 –&gt; 00:07:21,600<br>all these different lists in separate variables.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:21,600 –&gt; 00:07:24,040<br>So now, let’s say I wanted to write a function that</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:24,040 –&gt; 00:07:26,600<br>gets the grades for a particular student</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:26,600 –&gt; 00:07:31,400<br>for either problem set or micro quizzes grades.</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:31,400 –&gt; 00:07:33,120<br>This is a function that does that.</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:33,120 –&gt; 00:07:37,319<br>So again, it’s not looking super nice.</p>
<p>125<br>00:07:37,319 –&gt; 00:07:39,399<br>So what is this function going to take in?</p>
<p>126<br>00:07:39,399 –&gt; 00:07:41,920<br>The who is going to be a string representing the name?</p>
<p>127<br>00:07:41,920 –&gt; 00:07:46,720<br>So for example, Anna, the what will be also a string representing</p>
<p>128<br>00:07:46,720 –&gt; 00:07:51,959<br>what information I’d like to grab, either PS or MQ.</p>
<p>129<br>00:07:51,959 –&gt; 00:07:55,800<br>And the data is going to be my master list of all the grades.</p>
<p>130<br>00:07:55,800 –&gt; 00:07:59,519<br>So this grade equals this list of everybody.</p>
<p>131<br>00:07:59,519 –&gt; 00:08:01,000<br>So what is this code going to do?</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:01,000 –&gt; 00:08:06,120<br>Well, it has a for loop down here and a nested for loop</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:06,120 –&gt; 00:08:07,480<br>inside it.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:07,480 –&gt; 00:08:10,000<br>The outer for loop basically looks</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:10,000 –&gt; 00:08:13,079<br>through each one of these elements here</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:13,079 –&gt; 00:08:16,120<br>and looks at the element at index 0.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:16,120 –&gt; 00:08:20,240<br>So either Eric, Anna, or John, and grabs only the list</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:20,240 –&gt; 00:08:25,519<br>where that piece, the string here, matches the who.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:25,519 –&gt; 00:08:29,240<br>So if student at index 0 equals who right here,</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:29,240 –&gt; 00:08:31,280<br>then we’ve found the student I’m interested in grabbing</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:31,280 –&gt; 00:08:33,039<br>the information for.</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:33,039 –&gt; 00:08:33,720<br>Cool.</p>
<p>143<br>00:08:33,720 –&gt; 00:08:37,960<br>So now I’ve grabbed the right piece, the right list.</p>
<p>144<br>00:08:37,960 –&gt; 00:08:42,519<br>And now I’m interested in their grades for a particular what?</p>
<p>145<br>00:08:42,519 –&gt; 00:08:44,320<br>So either MQ or PS.</p>
<p>146<br>00:08:44,320 –&gt; 00:08:48,320<br>So I do the exact same thing again for that list here.</p>
<p>147<br>00:08:48,320 –&gt; 00:08:52,480<br>So if I’m interested in Anna’s PS grades,</p>
<p>148<br>00:08:52,480 –&gt; 00:08:56,680<br>I grab these lists here.</p>
<p>149<br>00:08:56,679 –&gt; 00:09:01,079<br>And then I’m going to check if the info at index 0,</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:01,079 –&gt; 00:09:04,279<br>so either this PS or this MQ matches the what?</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:04,279 –&gt; 00:09:06,839<br>So either PS or MQ to match what I’m</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:06,839 –&gt; 00:09:08,839<br>interested in grabbing the information,</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:08,839 –&gt; 00:09:10,439<br>what information I’m interested in grabbing.</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:10,439 –&gt; 00:09:14,279<br>And then I’m going to go inside this if statement</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:14,279 –&gt; 00:09:17,439<br>if they match, and then I return the who in the info.</p>
<p>156<br>00:09:17,439 –&gt; 00:09:19,120<br>So again, super complex.</p>
<p>157<br>00:09:19,120 –&gt; 00:09:21,279<br>No need to understand this that well,</p>
<p>158<br>00:09:21,279 –&gt; 00:09:24,240<br>because we’re not going to use this method for long.</p>
<p>159<br>00:09:24,240 –&gt; 00:09:27,120<br>So this get grades here.</p>
<p>160<br>00:09:27,120 –&gt; 00:09:30,320<br>For example, if I grab Irox micro quiz grades</p>
<p>161<br>00:09:30,320 –&gt; 00:09:34,919<br>and I run the code, it will return for me this tuple that</p>
<p>162<br>00:09:34,919 –&gt; 00:09:36,879<br>returns for me the name of the student.</p>
<p>163<br>00:09:36,879 –&gt; 00:09:39,720<br>And then just this sublist of the thing</p>
<p>164<br>00:09:39,720 –&gt; 00:09:42,320<br>that I was interested in in this case, micro quiz.</p>
<p>165<br>00:09:42,320 –&gt; 00:09:43,960<br>And it grabs for me all the grades.</p>
<p>166<br>00:09:43,960 –&gt; 00:09:47,240<br>And then I can then index into this returned tuple</p>
<p>167<br>00:09:47,240 –&gt; 00:09:49,639<br>to grab either the first quiz or the second quiz grades.</p>
<p>168<br>00:09:50,319 –&gt; 00:09:52,319<br>OK.</p>
<p>169<br>00:09:52,319 –&gt; 00:09:54,399<br>And same for Anna, right?</p>
<p>170<br>00:09:54,399 –&gt; 00:09:58,120<br>In this particular case, it grabs for me just the tuple</p>
<p>171<br>00:09:58,120 –&gt; 00:10:01,720<br>with my name and then that sublist with the promsite grades.</p>
<p>172<br>00:10:04,720 –&gt; 00:10:08,120<br>OK, so again, really messy.</p>
<p>173<br>00:10:08,120 –&gt; 00:10:09,799<br>I’ve made my design choice for how</p>
<p>174<br>00:10:09,799 –&gt; 00:10:13,480<br>to create all these lists with sublists and sublists</p>
<p>175<br>00:10:13,480 –&gt; 00:10:15,519<br>within those.</p>
<p>176<br>00:10:15,519 –&gt; 00:10:17,759<br>And so I’d have to document that probably</p>
<p>177<br>00:10:17,759 –&gt; 00:10:19,240<br>if I was using this method.</p>
<p>178<br>00:10:19,240 –&gt; 00:10:22,159<br>And then this function to grab this information,</p>
<p>179<br>00:10:22,159 –&gt; 00:10:27,279<br>again, super complex, hard to read.</p>
<p>180<br>00:10:27,279 –&gt; 00:10:30,240<br>So it’s not really a great way to store information either.</p>
<p>181<br>00:10:30,240 –&gt; 00:10:35,480<br>But the idea behind this, which is to try to store some data</p>
<p>182<br>00:10:35,480 –&gt; 00:10:40,759<br>associated with some sort of key, the PS or MQ,</p>
<p>183<br>00:10:40,759 –&gt; 00:10:43,039<br>or in this case, I’m storing a bunch of grades</p>
<p>184<br>00:10:43,039 –&gt; 00:10:44,360<br>for Eric or Anna or Tom.</p>
<p>185<br>00:10:44,360 –&gt; 00:10:47,399<br>That idea we can explore.</p>
<p>186<br>00:10:47,399 –&gt; 00:10:50,439<br>And that’s basically what dictionaries will do for us.</p>
<p>187<br>00:10:50,439 –&gt; 00:10:53,519<br>It will allow us to create data structures</p>
<p>188<br>00:10:53,519 –&gt; 00:10:59,079<br>that map some sort of custom index, a key, to some value.</p>
<p>189<br>00:10:59,079 –&gt; 00:11:01,439<br>So much like a book dictionary does, right?</p>
<p>190<br>00:11:01,439 –&gt; 00:11:04,319<br>It maps the word to its definition.</p>
<p>191<br>00:11:04,319 –&gt; 00:11:06,399<br>We’ll be able to create our own dictionaries that</p>
<p>192<br>00:11:06,399 –&gt; 00:11:10,039<br>map some object to another object.</p>
<p>193<br>00:11:10,039 –&gt; 00:11:14,919<br>So when we create a dictionary, we call every sort of quote</p>
<p>194<br>00:11:15,199 –&gt; 00:11:17,679<br>element in the dictionary an entry.</p>
<p>195<br>00:11:17,679 –&gt; 00:11:22,839<br>And that entry is that mapping of a key to a value.</p>
<p>196<br>00:11:22,839 –&gt; 00:11:26,000<br>So just to draw a parallel with a list,</p>
<p>197<br>00:11:26,000 –&gt; 00:11:30,559<br>we can think of a list as mapping something to another something.</p>
<p>198<br>00:11:30,559 –&gt; 00:11:37,399<br>The thing that a list maps is this index, number 0, 1, 2, 3,</p>
<p>199<br>00:11:37,399 –&gt; 00:11:38,399<br>in that order, right?</p>
<p>200<br>00:11:38,399 –&gt; 00:11:41,559<br>So it has to start, have an element at index 0,</p>
<p>201<br>00:11:41,559 –&gt; 00:11:45,799<br>and then that index increases by 1 from there on.</p>
<p>202<br>00:11:45,799 –&gt; 00:11:48,239<br>And for each one of these indices,</p>
<p>203<br>00:11:48,239 –&gt; 00:11:53,599<br>I’m mapping that index to some element in my list.</p>
<p>204<br>00:11:53,599 –&gt; 00:11:54,959<br>That’s basically what the list does.</p>
<p>205<br>00:11:54,959 –&gt; 00:11:56,839<br>There’s something associated with index 0,</p>
<p>206<br>00:11:56,839 –&gt; 00:11:59,919<br>something associated with index 1, and so on.</p>
<p>207<br>00:11:59,919 –&gt; 00:12:04,159<br>So it’s kind of like a very restrictive dictionary.</p>
<p>208<br>00:12:04,159 –&gt; 00:12:08,439<br>An actual Python dictionary works in similar way,</p>
<p>209<br>00:12:08,440 –&gt; 00:12:13,960<br>except that now I am not putting any restrictions on my indices.</p>
<p>210<br>00:12:13,960 –&gt; 00:12:18,840<br>My indices here become these sort of custom indices, call the key.</p>
<p>211<br>00:12:18,840 –&gt; 00:12:24,280<br>And so now I’m able to associate a value equivalent element</p>
<p>212<br>00:12:24,280 –&gt; 00:12:26,680<br>in my list with that key.</p>
<p>213<br>00:12:26,680 –&gt; 00:12:30,320<br>So I can have an element associated with any object.</p>
<p>214<br>00:12:33,080 –&gt; 00:12:35,760<br>So I am using the term value here.</p>
<p>215<br>00:12:35,759 –&gt; 00:12:41,600<br>And in a dictionary, the key is associated with a value.</p>
<p>216<br>00:12:41,600 –&gt; 00:12:43,960<br>And that’s one entry in the dictionary.</p>
<p>217<br>00:12:43,960 –&gt; 00:12:45,840<br>Now this is going to be a little bit confusing,</p>
<p>218<br>00:12:45,840 –&gt; 00:12:49,080<br>because we’ve been using the term value</p>
<p>219<br>00:12:49,080 –&gt; 00:12:52,679<br>to refer to just some object’s value, right?</p>
<p>220<br>00:12:52,679 –&gt; 00:12:58,120<br>Like, variable A has value 5, or something like that.</p>
<p>221<br>00:12:58,120 –&gt; 00:13:00,319<br>But now I’m going to try to make a conscious effort.</p>
<p>222<br>00:13:00,319 –&gt; 00:13:02,879<br>Now that we’re introducing dictionary and dictionary values</p>
<p>223<br>00:13:02,879 –&gt; 00:13:08,559<br>associated with a key, whenever I’m talking about the dictionary’s value</p>
<p>224<br>00:13:08,559 –&gt; 00:13:11,960<br>to say dictionary value, just so it’s not confusing.</p>
<p>225<br>00:13:11,960 –&gt; 00:13:13,679<br>But just keep that in mind.</p>
<p>226<br>00:13:13,679 –&gt; 00:13:15,759<br>It can be a little bit confusing at first.</p>
<p>227<br>00:13:15,759 –&gt; 00:13:20,080<br>Now that we’re using the same terminology for two different things.</p>
<p>228<br>00:13:20,080 –&gt; 00:13:22,399<br>So we’re going to go through in this lecture,</p>
<p>229<br>00:13:22,399 –&gt; 00:13:26,240<br>we’re going to introduce a bunch of syntax and operations with dictionaries.</p>
<p>230<br>00:13:26,240 –&gt; 00:13:28,200<br>And there are lots of you try it exercises</p>
<p>231<br>00:13:28,200 –&gt; 00:13:30,600<br>just to give you a little bit of practice with the syntax,</p>
<p>232<br>00:13:30,600 –&gt; 00:13:33,840<br>because this is kind of a syntax heavy lecture.</p>
<p>233<br>00:13:33,840 –&gt; 00:13:36,159<br>So hopefully it helps a little bit.</p>
<p>234<br>00:13:36,159 –&gt; 00:13:41,080<br>But let’s first see how to store data in a Python dictionary.</p>
<p>235<br>00:13:41,080 –&gt; 00:13:45,320<br>So as I mentioned, a Python dictionary stores entries.</p>
<p>236<br>00:13:45,320 –&gt; 00:13:48,680<br>And that entry is a key value pair.</p>
<p>237<br>00:13:48,680 –&gt; 00:13:53,000<br>So you’re mapping one key to its value.</p>
<p>238<br>00:13:53,000 –&gt; 00:13:54,960<br>The key can be any immutable object,</p>
<p>239<br>00:13:54,960 –&gt; 00:13:57,080<br>and we’re going to see what this means in a little bit.</p>
<p>240<br>00:13:57,080 –&gt; 00:13:59,360<br>And the value associated with that key,</p>
<p>241<br>00:13:59,360 –&gt; 00:14:01,840<br>or the Python value associated with that key,</p>
<p>242<br>00:14:01,840 –&gt; 00:14:07,279<br>can be any object you’d like, even lists or other dictionaries.</p>
<p>243<br>00:14:07,279 –&gt; 00:14:09,680<br>So the way we create a Python dictionary</p>
<p>244<br>00:14:09,680 –&gt; 00:14:14,039<br>is by using these open and closed curly braces.</p>
<p>245<br>00:14:14,039 –&gt; 00:14:16,639<br>So tuples were open and closed parentheses.</p>
<p>246<br>00:14:16,639 –&gt; 00:14:19,039<br>Lists were open and closed square brackets.</p>
<p>247<br>00:14:19,039 –&gt; 00:14:22,000<br>Dictionaries are open and closed curly braces.</p>
<p>248<br>00:14:22,000 –&gt; 00:14:24,920<br>And this creates inside memory an empty dictionary.</p>
<p>249<br>00:14:24,920 –&gt; 00:14:27,480<br>So an dictionary with zero entries.</p>
<p>250<br>00:14:27,480 –&gt; 00:14:30,960<br>So the length of that dictionary is zero.</p>
<p>251<br>00:14:30,960 –&gt; 00:14:33,480<br>To create a dictionary with one entry in it,</p>
<p>252<br>00:14:33,480 –&gt; 00:14:35,879<br>again, we have curly braces.</p>
<p>253<br>00:14:35,879 –&gt; 00:14:37,480<br>And we add one entry in it.</p>
<p>254<br>00:14:37,480 –&gt; 00:14:40,360<br>So this something colon, something else,</p>
<p>255<br>00:14:40,360 –&gt; 00:14:43,440<br>is an entry in my dictionary, one entry.</p>
<p>256<br>00:14:43,440 –&gt; 00:14:46,879<br>And the thing before the colon is the key.</p>
<p>257<br>00:14:46,879 –&gt; 00:14:49,360<br>And the thing after the colon is the value associated</p>
<p>258<br>00:14:49,360 –&gt; 00:14:49,960<br>with that key.</p>
<p>259<br>00:14:53,680 –&gt; 00:14:56,399<br>So you can think of it if we’re drawing a parallel to lists.</p>
<p>260<br>00:14:56,399 –&gt; 00:15:00,959<br>This is now mapping at this custom index 4,</p>
<p>261<br>00:15:00,959 –&gt; 00:15:02,360<br>we’re putting elements 16.</p>
<p>262<br>00:15:05,639 –&gt; 00:15:07,879<br>OK, so we can also create dictionaries</p>
<p>263<br>00:15:07,879 –&gt; 00:15:09,959<br>that aren’t just full of integers.</p>
<p>264<br>00:15:09,959 –&gt; 00:15:12,639<br>And you can mix and match data types as you’d like.</p>
<p>265<br>00:15:12,639 –&gt; 00:15:15,439<br>But usually in dictionaries, we have</p>
<p>266<br>00:15:15,439 –&gt; 00:15:17,879<br>the keys all be the same type.</p>
<p>267<br>00:15:17,879 –&gt; 00:15:20,840<br>And the values all be the same type.</p>
<p>268<br>00:15:20,840 –&gt; 00:15:23,559<br>But you can certainly mix and match types just like it.</p>
<p>269<br>00:15:23,559 –&gt; 00:15:26,519<br>You could create lists and tuples full of an integer</p>
<p>270<br>00:15:26,519 –&gt; 00:15:31,359<br>and the float and another list and mix and match in that way.</p>
<p>271<br>00:15:31,359 –&gt; 00:15:33,279<br>So here I’m creating a dictionary.</p>
<p>272<br>00:15:33,279 –&gt; 00:15:36,759<br>Again, open and close curly braces starts my dictionary.</p>
<p>273<br>00:15:36,759 –&gt; 00:15:39,359<br>And it has four elements in it.</p>
<p>274<br>00:15:39,359 –&gt; 00:15:41,719<br>So each four entries in it.</p>
<p>275<br>00:15:41,719 –&gt; 00:15:45,000<br>And each entry is separated by a comma.</p>
<p>276<br>00:15:45,000 –&gt; 00:15:47,199<br>I’ve got here my first entry.</p>
<p>277<br>00:15:47,200 –&gt; 00:15:54,400<br>So it is mapping the key Anna to the dictionary value b.</p>
<p>278<br>00:15:54,400 –&gt; 00:15:58,080<br>My second entry maps key map to value a.</p>
<p>279<br>00:15:58,080 –&gt; 00:16:00,480<br>Third entry maps key drawn to value b.</p>
<p>280<br>00:16:00,480 –&gt; 00:16:03,759<br>And last entry maps key Katie to value a.</p>
<p>281<br>00:16:03,759 –&gt; 00:16:07,360<br>So this is a dictionary that essentially maps strings</p>
<p>282<br>00:16:07,360 –&gt; 00:16:09,920<br>to other strings.</p>
<p>283<br>00:16:09,920 –&gt; 00:16:12,960<br>So you can see here, I’ve kind of visualized</p>
<p>284<br>00:16:12,960 –&gt; 00:16:15,400<br>the dictionary that we just created.</p>
<p>285<br>00:16:15,399 –&gt; 00:16:18,079<br>We’ve got these custom indices.</p>
<p>286<br>00:16:18,079 –&gt; 00:16:25,240<br>So we’re basically mapping names to letter grades.</p>
<p>287<br>00:16:25,240 –&gt; 00:16:26,399<br>Everything OK so far.</p>
<p>288<br>00:16:26,399 –&gt; 00:16:27,759<br>Does it make sense?</p>
<p>289<br>00:16:27,759 –&gt; 00:16:29,120<br>I guess conceptually.</p>
<p>290<br>00:16:29,120 –&gt; 00:16:29,639<br>OK.</p>
<p>291<br>00:16:29,639 –&gt; 00:16:32,120<br>Awesome.</p>
<p>292<br>00:16:32,120 –&gt; 00:16:35,199<br>OK, so the first thing we’d like to do</p>
<p>293<br>00:16:35,199 –&gt; 00:16:38,120<br>is once we have a dictionary full of a bunch of entries,</p>
<p>294<br>00:16:38,120 –&gt; 00:16:40,439<br>how do we grab an entry?</p>
<p>295<br>00:16:40,439 –&gt; 00:16:45,079<br>How do we look up a value associated with a key?</p>
<p>296<br>00:16:45,080 –&gt; 00:16:49,440<br>So the way we do that is in a very similar way</p>
<p>297<br>00:16:49,440 –&gt; 00:16:54,160<br>to the way we look up an element in a list.</p>
<p>298<br>00:16:54,160 –&gt; 00:16:58,480<br>A key in a dictionary is just a custom index.</p>
<p>299<br>00:16:58,480 –&gt; 00:17:00,560<br>So how did we look up an element in a list?</p>
<p>300<br>00:17:00,560 –&gt; 00:17:03,240<br>So if I wanted the element at index three,</p>
<p>301<br>00:17:03,240 –&gt; 00:17:05,920<br>I would basically say L square brackets three.</p>
<p>302<br>00:17:05,920 –&gt; 00:17:09,200<br>And that grabs for me the value at that index.</p>
<p>303<br>00:17:09,200 –&gt; 00:17:12,400<br>Well now I’ve got my custom indices.</p>
<p>304<br>00:17:12,400 –&gt; 00:17:15,680<br>My custom indices are these strings.</p>
<p>305<br>00:17:15,680 –&gt; 00:17:17,640<br>The syntax will be exactly the same.</p>
<p>306<br>00:17:17,640 –&gt; 00:17:20,120<br>I’ve got this custom index I’d like to look up.</p>
<p>307<br>00:17:20,120 –&gt; 00:17:26,680<br>So I say dictionary, name, square bracket, custom index.</p>
<p>308<br>00:17:26,680 –&gt; 00:17:31,160<br>So if I say grade, square bracket, John, Python will go in</p>
<p>309<br>00:17:31,160 –&gt; 00:17:33,200<br>to my dictionary named grades.</p>
<p>310<br>00:17:33,200 –&gt; 00:17:36,040<br>It’ll look up the key, John.</p>
<p>311<br>00:17:36,040 –&gt; 00:17:39,880<br>And it’ll return for me the value associated with that key.</p>
<p>312<br>00:17:39,880 –&gt; 00:17:42,200<br>B.</p>
<p>313<br>00:17:42,200 –&gt; 00:17:46,559<br>So this entire expression here is evaluate or gets</p>
<p>314<br>00:17:46,559 –&gt; 00:17:50,279<br>replaced with the string B. Just like when we indexed into a list,</p>
<p>315<br>00:17:50,279 –&gt; 00:17:54,120<br>L square brackets three, we replaced that entire indexing</p>
<p>316<br>00:17:54,120 –&gt; 00:17:57,640<br>operation with the value of the element at that location.</p>
<p>317<br>00:17:57,640 –&gt; 00:17:59,880<br>So similar here.</p>
<p>318<br>00:17:59,880 –&gt; 00:18:04,559<br>If I try to index into a dictionary and that key doesn’t exist,</p>
<p>319<br>00:18:04,559 –&gt; 00:18:07,440<br>so notice my dictionary has no string grace,</p>
<p>320<br>00:18:07,440 –&gt; 00:18:09,120<br>Python will give me a keyer.</p>
<p>321<br>00:18:09,120 –&gt; 00:18:11,240<br>So if you run code with dictionaries</p>
<p>322<br>00:18:11,240 –&gt; 00:18:15,000<br>and you get a keyer exception being raised in the console,</p>
<p>323<br>00:18:15,000 –&gt; 00:18:18,079<br>you’ll know that you’re trying to index into a key that</p>
<p>324<br>00:18:18,079 –&gt; 00:18:19,160<br>doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>325<br>00:18:22,160 –&gt; 00:18:25,640<br>So the question might be, yes, we’re</p>
<p>326<br>00:18:25,640 –&gt; 00:18:29,759<br>able to look up a value given a key.</p>
<p>327<br>00:18:29,759 –&gt; 00:18:32,079<br>Can we do the same thing but backwards?</p>
<p>328<br>00:18:32,079 –&gt; 00:18:37,000<br>Given a key, sorry, given a value like a, b, c, whatever,</p>
<p>329<br>00:18:37,000 –&gt; 00:18:39,920<br>can we look up a key associated with that value?</p>
<p>330<br>00:18:39,920 –&gt; 00:18:41,240<br>And the answer is no.</p>
<p>331<br>00:18:41,240 –&gt; 00:18:44,960<br>We’d have to write some sort of loop or some sort of code</p>
<p>332<br>00:18:44,960 –&gt; 00:18:47,400<br>that goes through every item in my dictionary</p>
<p>333<br>00:18:47,400 –&gt; 00:18:52,560<br>to check each value and see whether the key associated</p>
<p>334<br>00:18:52,560 –&gt; 00:18:54,960<br>with that value is equivalent to the one I’m looking for.</p>
<p>335<br>00:18:54,960 –&gt; 00:18:58,920<br>So there is no nice expression to do that backward operation.</p>
<p>336<br>00:18:58,920 –&gt; 00:19:01,279<br>And that’s because the values in my dictionary</p>
<p>337<br>00:19:01,279 –&gt; 00:19:02,120<br>can be repeated.</p>
<p>338<br>00:19:02,120 –&gt; 00:19:05,880<br>So if I look up the value b, and I want what’s</p>
<p>339<br>00:19:05,880 –&gt; 00:19:09,519<br>the key associated with b, well, there’s actually two of them.</p>
<p>340<br>00:19:09,519 –&gt; 00:19:11,960<br>So how does Python know I want both of them?</p>
<p>341<br>00:19:11,960 –&gt; 00:19:14,000<br>How does it know I want only one of them?</p>
<p>342<br>00:19:14,000 –&gt; 00:19:16,759<br>How does it know I want maybe a list of all these things</p>
<p>343<br>00:19:16,759 –&gt; 00:19:17,440<br>it doesn’t?</p>
<p>344<br>00:19:17,440 –&gt; 00:19:20,960<br>So you’d have to write code that does something</p>
<p>345<br>00:19:20,960 –&gt; 00:19:22,759<br>for that operation.</p>
<p>346<br>00:19:22,759 –&gt; 00:19:26,119<br>And we’re going to see how to do that later.</p>
<p>347<br>00:19:26,119 –&gt; 00:19:28,200<br>OK, so let’s have you work on this you try it.</p>
<p>348<br>00:19:28,200 –&gt; 00:19:31,480<br>And this is just an exercise in looking up a value.</p>
<p>349<br>00:19:31,480 –&gt; 00:19:33,920<br>So this is a function.</p>
<p>350<br>00:19:33,920 –&gt; 00:19:36,119<br>I’d like to write according to the specification.</p>
<p>351<br>00:19:36,119 –&gt; 00:19:38,559<br>So it’s called find grades.</p>
<p>352<br>00:19:38,559 –&gt; 00:19:41,960<br>Grades is a dictionary mapping student names to grades.</p>
<p>353<br>00:19:41,960 –&gt; 00:19:46,759<br>So string to string exactly like we’ve seen in the previous slide.</p>
<p>354<br>00:19:46,759 –&gt; 00:19:50,559<br>And students is going to be a list of student names.</p>
<p>355<br>00:19:50,559 –&gt; 00:19:54,119<br>So in the example here, I’ve got my input dictionary</p>
<p>356<br>00:19:54,119 –&gt; 00:19:55,559<br>this thing we just saw.</p>
<p>357<br>00:19:55,559 –&gt; 00:19:58,240<br>And then my list of student grades is, for example,</p>
<p>358<br>00:19:58,240 –&gt; 00:20:01,519<br>these two strings, mat and Katie.</p>
<p>359<br>00:20:01,519 –&gt; 00:20:04,000<br>For a bunch of these questions, especially</p>
<p>360<br>00:20:04,000 –&gt; 00:20:05,599<br>even on microquiz and things like that,</p>
<p>361<br>00:20:05,599 –&gt; 00:20:08,199<br>if it gets a little confusing when I</p>
<p>362<br>00:20:08,199 –&gt; 00:20:13,039<br>try to write the specification in a very detailed way</p>
<p>363<br>00:20:13,039 –&gt; 00:20:16,879<br>to make it clear what I’d like from this function,</p>
<p>364<br>00:20:16,879 –&gt; 00:20:19,599<br>it’s important to try to use the example</p>
<p>365<br>00:20:19,599 –&gt; 00:20:21,639<br>to help you figure out what we’d like.</p>
<p>366<br>00:20:21,639 –&gt; 00:20:23,399<br>Because we’re writing the specification</p>
<p>367<br>00:20:23,399 –&gt; 00:20:24,639<br>in a general sense.</p>
<p>368<br>00:20:24,639 –&gt; 00:20:26,439<br>But the example should hopefully make</p>
<p>369<br>00:20:26,439 –&gt; 00:20:28,919<br>things really clear for what we’d like.</p>
<p>370<br>00:20:28,919 –&gt; 00:20:32,559<br>So in this particular case, what we want the function to return</p>
<p>371<br>00:20:32,559 –&gt; 00:20:38,000<br>is a list of the grades for the students being pasted.</p>
<p>372<br>00:20:38,000 –&gt; 00:20:40,599<br>So we look up mat, we see their grades as c,</p>
<p>373<br>00:20:40,599 –&gt; 00:20:42,559<br>we look up Katie, their grade is an a.</p>
<p>374<br>00:20:42,559 –&gt; 00:20:45,799<br>So I want to return the list c comma a in the same order</p>
<p>375<br>00:20:45,799 –&gt; 00:20:48,039<br>that I passed in my students.</p>
<p>376<br>00:20:48,039 –&gt; 00:20:50,000<br>So I’ll give you a couple of minutes to work on that,</p>
<p>377<br>00:20:50,000 –&gt; 00:20:51,599<br>and then we can write it together.</p>
<p>378<br>00:20:51,599 –&gt; 00:20:58,119<br>So that’s line 94.</p>
<p>379<br>00:20:58,119 –&gt; 00:21:01,079<br>So this is just the exercise on looking up values in the dictionary.</p>
<p>380<br>00:21:02,559 –&gt; 00:21:04,200<br>All right, does anybody have a start for me?</p>
<p>381<br>00:21:09,200 –&gt; 00:21:10,679<br>Yes, please.</p>
<p>382<br>00:21:10,679 –&gt; 00:21:11,679<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>383<br>00:21:11,679 –&gt; 00:21:12,839<br>I have a question.</p>
<p>384<br>00:21:12,839 –&gt; 00:21:14,039<br>Yep, I’ll knew.</p>
<p>385<br>00:21:14,039 –&gt; 00:21:17,319<br>How about that?</p>
<p>386<br>00:21:17,319 –&gt; 00:21:19,319<br>So this will be my results list.</p>
<p>387<br>00:21:19,319 –&gt; 00:21:19,839<br>Yep.</p>
<p>388<br>00:21:19,839 –&gt; 00:21:21,639<br>I have three.</p>
<p>389<br>00:21:21,639 –&gt; 00:21:22,639<br>I have three.</p>
<p>390<br>00:21:22,639 –&gt; 00:21:23,639<br>Yep, for a loop.</p>
<p>391<br>00:21:23,639 –&gt; 00:21:25,639<br>I have a L and two here.</p>
<p>392<br>00:21:32,839 –&gt; 00:21:41,720<br>Yep, so grade square bracket LM looks up the value associated</p>
<p>393<br>00:21:41,720 –&gt; 00:21:45,519<br>with my student named LM.</p>
<p>394<br>00:21:45,519 –&gt; 00:21:47,919<br>And maybe we can save it like this.</p>
<p>395<br>00:21:47,919 –&gt; 00:21:49,559<br>Grade equals this.</p>
<p>396<br>00:21:49,559 –&gt; 00:21:51,559<br>And then you set a pen.</p>
<p>397<br>00:21:51,559 –&gt; 00:21:57,480<br>Yep, so we can do lnu dot append the grade.</p>
<p>398<br>00:21:57,480 –&gt; 00:21:59,799<br>Anything else?</p>
<p>399<br>00:21:59,799 –&gt; 00:22:00,639<br>Yep, a return.</p>
<p>400<br>00:22:00,639 –&gt; 00:22:04,079<br>So we can return lnu.</p>
<p>401<br>00:22:04,079 –&gt; 00:22:07,039<br>Yep, so very reasonable code.</p>
<p>402<br>00:22:07,039 –&gt; 00:22:08,000<br>I like it a lot.</p>
<p>403<br>00:22:11,159 –&gt; 00:22:12,720<br>Besides the first lecture, I don’t know</p>
<p>404<br>00:22:12,720 –&gt; 00:22:15,159<br>that we’ve written any code that didn’t involve a loop.</p>
<p>405<br>00:22:15,159 –&gt; 00:22:19,480<br>So your best bet for writing code for any sort of thing</p>
<p>406<br>00:22:19,480 –&gt; 00:22:22,359<br>in this class is to think what loop can I do.</p>
<p>407<br>00:22:22,359 –&gt; 00:22:26,480<br>So let’s run the code, and it should return for me to see comma a,</p>
<p>408<br>00:22:26,480 –&gt; 00:22:27,000<br>and it does.</p>
<p>409<br>00:22:30,799 –&gt; 00:22:34,519<br>Now that we can iterate, so I mentioned this before,</p>
<p>410<br>00:22:34,519 –&gt; 00:22:37,359<br>but once we’re iterating over two pulls and lists and things</p>
<p>411<br>00:22:37,359 –&gt; 00:22:40,399<br>like that, one thing I would add it just for debugging purposes</p>
<p>412<br>00:22:40,399 –&gt; 00:22:45,879<br>is say something like LM is, and then you can say an example</p>
<p>413<br>00:22:45,879 –&gt; 00:22:49,319<br>of what it could be like Anna or Matt or whatever.</p>
<p>414<br>00:22:49,319 –&gt; 00:22:54,119<br>It could be just to remind yourself that that loop variable</p>
<p>415<br>00:22:54,119 –&gt; 00:22:55,159<br>is a string.</p>
<p>416<br>00:22:55,159 –&gt; 00:22:56,720<br>And so it’s one less thing to remember</p>
<p>417<br>00:22:56,720 –&gt; 00:22:58,559<br>as you’re writing for their code.</p>
<p>418<br>00:22:58,679 –&gt; 00:22:59,639<br>This is really nice.</p>
<p>419<br>00:23:04,000 –&gt; 00:23:06,960<br>OK, so dictionaries are already proving</p>
<p>420<br>00:23:06,960 –&gt; 00:23:09,240<br>to be really, really useful.</p>
<p>421<br>00:23:09,240 –&gt; 00:23:14,119<br>We can create values associated with custom indices.</p>
<p>422<br>00:23:14,119 –&gt; 00:23:16,319<br>And if we want to grab the value associated</p>
<p>423<br>00:23:16,319 –&gt; 00:23:19,000<br>with that custom index, it’s really just</p>
<p>424<br>00:23:19,000 –&gt; 00:23:23,519<br>a matter of indexing using a key, using that specific key,</p>
<p>425<br>00:23:23,519 –&gt; 00:23:26,359<br>much like we did indexing into a list.</p>
<p>426<br>00:23:26,359 –&gt; 00:23:27,240<br>No need to loop.</p>
<p>427<br>00:23:27,240 –&gt; 00:23:29,599<br>None of that iteration.</p>
<p>428<br>00:23:29,599 –&gt; 00:23:35,159<br>It’s just a single line of code that indexes into the list.</p>
<p>429<br>00:23:35,159 –&gt; 00:23:36,599<br>So let’s see a few more operations</p>
<p>430<br>00:23:36,599 –&gt; 00:23:38,839<br>before we do the next, you try it.</p>
<p>431<br>00:23:38,839 –&gt; 00:23:41,479<br>So I’ve got my list of grades that we’ve</p>
<p>432<br>00:23:41,479 –&gt; 00:23:44,119<br>been working with in the past couple of slides.</p>
<p>433<br>00:23:44,119 –&gt; 00:23:48,679<br>Let’s say that we now want to add a new student in their grade.</p>
<p>434<br>00:23:48,679 –&gt; 00:23:52,759<br>The way we do that is very similar to the way</p>
<p>435<br>00:23:52,759 –&gt; 00:23:56,200<br>that we would add an element to a list</p>
<p>436<br>00:23:56,200 –&gt; 00:24:00,119<br>once we already have an index for that list.</p>
<p>437<br>00:24:00,119 –&gt; 00:24:04,039<br>Here, notice, we don’t actually have a slot for grace.</p>
<p>438<br>00:24:04,039 –&gt; 00:24:07,160<br>Yet I’d like to add her to my dictionary.</p>
<p>439<br>00:24:07,160 –&gt; 00:24:09,039<br>That’s OK.</p>
<p>440<br>00:24:09,039 –&gt; 00:24:14,079<br>With this particular syntax here, so grades at key grace,</p>
<p>441<br>00:24:14,079 –&gt; 00:24:18,720<br>if Python does not find grace in my dictionary of keys,</p>
<p>442<br>00:24:18,720 –&gt; 00:24:20,119<br>it’ll just add her.</p>
<p>443<br>00:24:20,119 –&gt; 00:24:22,119<br>OK.</p>
<p>444<br>00:24:22,119 –&gt; 00:24:23,639<br>Which is really nice.</p>
<p>445<br>00:24:23,639 –&gt; 00:24:26,079<br>I don’t need to check if she’s already in there.</p>
<p>446<br>00:24:26,079 –&gt; 00:24:27,079<br>There’s no looping.</p>
<p>447<br>00:24:27,079 –&gt; 00:24:29,719<br>You just say grades at grace equals a.</p>
<p>448<br>00:24:29,719 –&gt; 00:24:30,000<br>Boom.</p>
<p>449<br>00:24:30,000 –&gt; 00:24:32,799<br>It adds it for you.</p>
<p>450<br>00:24:32,799 –&gt; 00:24:35,839<br>What if I want to change an entry in my dictionary?</p>
<p>451<br>00:24:35,839 –&gt; 00:24:39,679<br>Well, let’s say I want to change grace as grade to a C.</p>
<p>452<br>00:24:39,679 –&gt; 00:24:43,719<br>Grades at custom index grace equals C.</p>
<p>453<br>00:24:43,719 –&gt; 00:24:46,759<br>We’ll go in, look at my keys.</p>
<p>454<br>00:24:46,759 –&gt; 00:24:51,119<br>When grace didn’t exist, Python added her with her value.</p>
<p>455<br>00:24:51,119 –&gt; 00:24:53,359<br>But she already exists there, so Python will just</p>
<p>456<br>00:24:53,359 –&gt; 00:24:56,879<br>overwrite her value.</p>
<p>457<br>00:24:56,879 –&gt; 00:24:58,679<br>So really nice.</p>
<p>458<br>00:24:58,679 –&gt; 00:25:00,719<br>Something to look out for in case you already</p>
<p>459<br>00:25:00,719 –&gt; 00:25:03,039<br>have values in the dictionary.</p>
<p>460<br>00:25:03,039 –&gt; 00:25:04,319<br>You want to be careful if you actually</p>
<p>461<br>00:25:04,319 –&gt; 00:25:05,719<br>do want to overwrite things.</p>
<p>462<br>00:25:05,719 –&gt; 00:25:07,679<br>But it’s really, really nice behavior.</p>
<p>463<br>00:25:07,679 –&gt; 00:25:10,879<br>And it’s different than lists, right?</p>
<p>464<br>00:25:10,879 –&gt; 00:25:13,959<br>Especially adding an entry to the dictionary.</p>
<p>465<br>00:25:17,000 –&gt; 00:25:19,359<br>You can delete entries much like we deleted entries</p>
<p>466<br>00:25:19,359 –&gt; 00:25:21,479<br>from a list.</p>
<p>467<br>00:25:21,479 –&gt; 00:25:24,519<br>We use the Dell function.</p>
<p>468<br>00:25:24,519 –&gt; 00:25:29,159<br>And the Dell function says what entry you’d like to delete</p>
<p>469<br>00:25:29,159 –&gt; 00:25:30,000<br>from what lists.</p>
<p>470<br>00:25:30,000 –&gt; 00:25:35,079<br>So here we just say the name of our dictionary at index Anna.</p>
<p>471<br>00:25:35,079 –&gt; 00:25:38,959<br>So this will completely remove Anna and her value</p>
<p>472<br>00:25:38,959 –&gt; 00:25:41,799<br>and the value associated with Anna from the dictionary.</p>
<p>473<br>00:25:46,359 –&gt; 00:25:48,159<br>So what I want to make a note of is</p>
<p>474<br>00:25:48,160 –&gt; 00:25:50,320<br>that our dictionary is being mutated</p>
<p>475<br>00:25:50,320 –&gt; 00:25:52,800<br>with all of these different methods or all</p>
<p>476<br>00:25:52,800 –&gt; 00:25:54,880<br>of these different functions, right?</p>
<p>477<br>00:25:54,880 –&gt; 00:25:58,600<br>So here, when I added grace, I’ve mutated my original dictionary.</p>
<p>478<br>00:25:58,600 –&gt; 00:26:02,160<br>The animation didn’t make a copy of this dictionary</p>
<p>479<br>00:26:02,160 –&gt; 00:26:05,080<br>with grace added, leaving the original unchanged.</p>
<p>480<br>00:26:05,080 –&gt; 00:26:08,519<br>I’ve literally gone in and mutated my original dictionary</p>
<p>481<br>00:26:08,519 –&gt; 00:26:09,680<br>to add grace.</p>
<p>482<br>00:26:09,680 –&gt; 00:26:13,160<br>I’ve mutated the original dictionary to change her grade.</p>
<p>483<br>00:26:13,160 –&gt; 00:26:15,200<br>I’ve mutated the original dictionary</p>
<p>484<br>00:26:15,200 –&gt; 00:26:17,200<br>to remove Anna from the dictionary.</p>
<p>485<br>00:26:17,200 –&gt; 00:26:23,200<br>So all these functions are actually mutating my dictionary.</p>
<p>486<br>00:26:23,200 –&gt; 00:26:28,000<br>OK, one other very useful thing that you can do with dictionaries</p>
<p>487<br>00:26:28,000 –&gt; 00:26:31,880<br>is to check if a key is in my dictionary.</p>
<p>488<br>00:26:31,880 –&gt; 00:26:35,360<br>So we do this using the inoperator, the in keyword.</p>
<p>489<br>00:26:35,360 –&gt; 00:26:39,200<br>We’ve seen the in keyword being used to check</p>
<p>490<br>00:26:39,200 –&gt; 00:26:43,080<br>if an element is in a list, to check if a substring</p>
<p>491<br>00:26:43,080 –&gt; 00:26:45,360<br>or a character is in a string, to check</p>
<p>492<br>00:26:45,360 –&gt; 00:26:47,080<br>if some element is in a tuple.</p>
<p>493<br>00:26:47,079 –&gt; 00:26:53,639<br>We can also use it to check if an element or a key is in my dictionary.</p>
<p>494<br>00:26:53,639 –&gt; 00:26:57,319<br>So I want to make a note, it’s only checking the keys.</p>
<p>495<br>00:26:57,319 –&gt; 00:27:00,319<br>It does not look for the values in the dictionary.</p>
<p>496<br>00:27:00,319 –&gt; 00:27:03,639<br>We’ll see how to check if some value is in the dictionary</p>
<p>497<br>00:27:03,639 –&gt; 00:27:04,240<br>in a little bit.</p>
<p>498<br>00:27:04,240 –&gt; 00:27:06,439<br>But the in keyword specifically only</p>
<p>499<br>00:27:06,439 –&gt; 00:27:08,439<br>looks at the keys in the dictionary.</p>
<p>500<br>00:27:08,439 –&gt; 00:27:11,359<br>So if I have the expression, you know,</p>
<p>501<br>00:27:11,359 –&gt; 00:27:14,079<br>the string John is in grades, Python only</p>
<p>502<br>00:27:14,079 –&gt; 00:27:17,679<br>looks at the keys and say, yep, there it is.</p>
<p>503<br>00:27:17,679 –&gt; 00:27:19,359<br>I don’t care what values associated with it.</p>
<p>504<br>00:27:19,359 –&gt; 00:27:22,240<br>I just care that it’s in my keys.</p>
<p>505<br>00:27:22,240 –&gt; 00:27:26,519<br>So this entire expression here, John in grades will evaluate.</p>
<p>506<br>00:27:26,519 –&gt; 00:27:28,480<br>So we replaced with true.</p>
<p>507<br>00:27:28,480 –&gt; 00:27:31,240<br>Daniel obviously is not in my dictionary keys.</p>
<p>508<br>00:27:31,240 –&gt; 00:27:32,519<br>So it returns false.</p>
<p>509<br>00:27:32,519 –&gt; 00:27:38,039<br>B is not in my dictionary keys, even though it’s in my values.</p>
<p>510<br>00:27:38,039 –&gt; 00:27:41,039<br>It still returns false because it only looks at the keys.</p>
<p>511<br>00:27:44,720 –&gt; 00:27:49,599<br>All right, let’s have you try this exercise.</p>
<p>512<br>00:27:49,599 –&gt; 00:27:53,720<br>So function is called find in L. Again,</p>
<p>513<br>00:27:53,720 –&gt; 00:27:56,439<br>we can use the specifications and the example</p>
<p>514<br>00:27:56,439 –&gt; 00:27:59,960<br>to help us figure out what we’d like from this function.</p>
<p>515<br>00:27:59,960 –&gt; 00:28:04,960<br>So LD is going to be a list of dictionaries.</p>
<p>516<br>00:28:04,960 –&gt; 00:28:09,639<br>So in the example here, I’ve got three dictionaries defined.</p>
<p>517<br>00:28:09,639 –&gt; 00:28:12,799<br>And the first parameter here, the thing</p>
<p>518<br>00:28:12,799 –&gt; 00:28:18,039<br>being passed as LD is the list with d1, d2, d3 as my elements.</p>
<p>519<br>00:28:18,039 –&gt; 00:28:21,680<br>And k is just an integer.</p>
<p>520<br>00:28:21,680 –&gt; 00:28:26,119<br>What I’d like to do is return true from the function</p>
<p>521<br>00:28:26,119 –&gt; 00:28:31,519<br>if that k is a key in any of these dictionaries</p>
<p>522<br>00:28:31,519 –&gt; 00:28:32,599<br>and false otherwise.</p>
<p>523<br>00:28:32,599 –&gt; 00:28:36,119<br>So as soon as I see a key that matches k,</p>
<p>524<br>00:28:36,119 –&gt; 00:28:37,919<br>I want to return true.</p>
<p>525<br>00:28:37,920 –&gt; 00:28:44,640<br>So in this example here, when I look for the k2 inside these dictionaries,</p>
<p>526<br>00:28:44,640 –&gt; 00:28:46,640<br>d1 doesn’t have it, but d2 has it.</p>
<p>527<br>00:28:46,640 –&gt; 00:28:49,160<br>So I would return true.</p>
<p>528<br>00:28:49,160 –&gt; 00:28:53,039<br>When I look for 25 in that same list of dictionaries,</p>
<p>529<br>00:28:53,039 –&gt; 00:28:57,080<br>25 is a value in one of these in d3,</p>
<p>530<br>00:28:57,080 –&gt; 00:28:59,600<br>but it’s not a key in d1, d2, or d3.</p>
<p>531<br>00:28:59,600 –&gt; 00:29:00,759<br>So that would return false.</p>
<p>532<br>00:29:01,000 –&gt; 00:29:05,000<br>All right.</p>
<p>533<br>00:29:05,000 –&gt; 00:29:11,039<br>So that’s just a little lower line 115.</p>
<p>534<br>00:29:11,039 –&gt; 00:29:14,519<br>Give you a couple moments and then we can write it together like usual.</p>
<p>535<br>00:29:14,519 –&gt; 00:29:16,039<br>All right, does anyone want to start me off here?</p>
<p>536<br>00:29:16,039 –&gt; 00:29:19,519<br>So how can we do this?</p>
<p>537<br>00:29:22,640 –&gt; 00:29:25,160<br>Create a loop, yes?</p>
<p>538<br>00:29:25,160 –&gt; 00:29:25,960<br>Four?</p>
<p>539<br>00:29:25,960 –&gt; 00:29:28,559<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>540<br>00:29:28,559 –&gt; 00:29:29,360<br>Yep.</p>
<p>541<br>00:29:29,360 –&gt; 00:29:36,680<br>OK, so that means that d is, I can say like k1 mapped to v1 or something like that,</p>
<p>542<br>00:29:36,680 –&gt; 00:29:37,039<br>right?</p>
<p>543<br>00:29:37,039 –&gt; 00:29:37,840<br>Key to a value.</p>
<p>544<br>00:29:44,079 –&gt; 00:29:49,720<br>If k in d, yep.</p>
<p>545<br>00:29:49,720 –&gt; 00:29:54,880<br>So that will check for me my keys in that particular dictionary that I’m looking at right now.</p>
<p>546<br>00:29:56,960 –&gt; 00:29:59,799<br>Yep, we can immediately return true.</p>
<p>547<br>00:29:59,799 –&gt; 00:30:02,600<br>Right, as soon as we found it, no need to check the other dictionaries,</p>
<p>548<br>00:30:02,600 –&gt; 00:30:05,559<br>just pop out of the function and return true.</p>
<p>549<br>00:30:11,680 –&gt; 00:30:16,440<br>Same inside the if or inside the four outside the four.</p>
<p>550<br>00:30:16,440 –&gt; 00:30:19,240<br>Outside the four, we can return false.</p>
<p>551<br>00:30:19,240 –&gt; 00:30:20,880<br>Yep.</p>
<p>552<br>00:30:20,880 –&gt; 00:30:24,680<br>I like this code a lot.</p>
<p>553<br>00:30:24,680 –&gt; 00:30:28,720<br>It uses this inoperator to do that the task.</p>
<p>554<br>00:30:28,720 –&gt; 00:30:33,560<br>So the return false outside of the four loop works really well because if I’ve gone through</p>
<p>555<br>00:30:33,560 –&gt; 00:30:39,200<br>every d inside ld here, then I’m checking every single dictionary.</p>
<p>556<br>00:30:39,200 –&gt; 00:30:40,200<br>Right.</p>
<p>557<br>00:30:40,200 –&gt; 00:30:49,160<br>As soon as I find one that has that key, this return true acts like a break and a return.</p>
<p>558<br>00:30:49,160 –&gt; 00:30:52,680<br>Right, so breaks out of the loop and returns immediately.</p>
<p>559<br>00:30:52,680 –&gt; 00:30:56,080<br>And it doesn’t return false.</p>
<p>560<br>00:30:56,080 –&gt; 00:31:03,400<br>But if I’ve gone through every dictionary and didn’t find the key matching k, then I return false.</p>
<p>561<br>00:31:03,400 –&gt; 00:31:04,400<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>562<br>00:31:04,400 –&gt; 00:31:14,120<br>Did anybody try it a different way or is this?</p>
<p>563<br>00:31:14,120 –&gt; 00:31:17,240<br>We could certainly try it with a boolean flag, right?</p>
<p>564<br>00:31:17,240 –&gt; 00:31:22,160<br>We could flag the fact that we found it through some loop and keep track of it and at the</p>
<p>565<br>00:31:22,160 –&gt; 00:31:24,040<br>end just return that flag.</p>
<p>566<br>00:31:24,040 –&gt; 00:31:25,279<br>That’s another way to do it.</p>
<p>567<br>00:31:25,279 –&gt; 00:31:30,840<br>But this is probably the most Pythonically.</p>
<p>568<br>00:31:30,840 –&gt; 00:31:33,400<br>So we can run it on these two examples here, right?</p>
<p>569<br>00:31:33,400 –&gt; 00:31:38,640<br>So I’m expecting to looking up two to return true and looking up 25 to return false.</p>
<p>570<br>00:31:38,640 –&gt; 00:31:40,600<br>And it does.</p>
<p>571<br>00:31:40,600 –&gt; 00:31:44,640<br>Questions about this code or dictionary so far is everything.</p>
<p>572<br>00:31:44,640 –&gt; 00:31:47,640<br>Okay, so far.</p>
<p>573<br>00:31:47,640 –&gt; 00:31:48,640<br>Okay.</p>
<p>574<br>00:31:49,640 –&gt; 00:31:52,400<br>All right, a couple more operations.</p>
<p>575<br>00:31:52,400 –&gt; 00:31:55,320<br>So so far we’ve looked up values in a dictionary.</p>
<p>576<br>00:31:55,320 –&gt; 00:31:57,000<br>We’ve added stuff to the dictionary.</p>
<p>577<br>00:31:57,000 –&gt; 00:31:59,800<br>We’ve deleted stuff from the dictionary.</p>
<p>578<br>00:31:59,800 –&gt; 00:32:06,960<br>One really useful thing to do is to be able to look at every single entry in my dictionary.</p>
<p>579<br>00:32:06,960 –&gt; 00:32:13,480<br>The reason why we’d want to do this is because we should assume that when we create our dictionaries,</p>
<p>580<br>00:32:13,480 –&gt; 00:32:15,920<br>there’s no order to them.</p>
<p>581<br>00:32:15,920 –&gt; 00:32:17,920<br>This is very much unlike lists.</p>
<p>582<br>00:32:17,920 –&gt; 00:32:19,519<br>List had an order to them.</p>
<p>583<br>00:32:19,519 –&gt; 00:32:23,279<br>We knew that the first element in our list was at index zero.</p>
<p>584<br>00:32:23,279 –&gt; 00:32:25,519<br>The next one was at index one and so on, right?</p>
<p>585<br>00:32:25,519 –&gt; 00:32:29,120<br>List were ordered sequences of elements.</p>
<p>586<br>00:32:29,120 –&gt; 00:32:34,720<br>But dictionaries are not ordered sequences of elements.</p>
<p>587<br>00:32:34,720 –&gt; 00:32:36,920<br>That’s not super true.</p>
<p>588<br>00:32:36,920 –&gt; 00:32:42,080<br>There are up until a very recent version of Python, there was no guarantee to order.</p>
<p>589<br>00:32:42,079 –&gt; 00:32:46,960<br>They would put in some order that couldn’t, that I didn’t, I couldn’t figure out how it</p>
<p>590<br>00:32:46,960 –&gt; 00:32:48,919<br>was determined.</p>
<p>591<br>00:32:48,919 –&gt; 00:32:54,480<br>But I forget which Python version maybe 3.6 or something like that started to guarantee</p>
<p>592<br>00:32:54,480 –&gt; 00:32:59,480<br>an order when you in for for the list for the dictionary elements.</p>
<p>593<br>00:32:59,480 –&gt; 00:33:05,000<br>And that order was the same order that you inserted the elements.</p>
<p>594<br>00:33:05,000 –&gt; 00:33:09,319<br>But if you’d like to write robust code that could be run by people, you know, using</p>
<p>595<br>00:33:09,319 –&gt; 00:33:14,879<br>an older version of Python, you should write the code assuming that no such order exists.</p>
<p>596<br>00:33:14,879 –&gt; 00:33:19,720<br>And it’s okay, it doesn’t make the code that much harder to write.</p>
<p>597<br>00:33:19,720 –&gt; 00:33:26,240<br>But if we’re not assuming any order to Python entries in the dictionary, then that means</p>
<p>598<br>00:33:26,240 –&gt; 00:33:31,159<br>a lot of times we actually have to look at each entry in the dictionary to do some sort</p>
<p>599<br>00:33:31,159 –&gt; 00:33:33,359<br>of task.</p>
<p>600<br>00:33:33,359 –&gt; 00:33:37,879<br>So one of the first things you might want to do is to iterate through all the keys in</p>
<p>601<br>00:33:37,880 –&gt; 00:33:39,600<br>the dictionary.</p>
<p>602<br>00:33:39,600 –&gt; 00:33:44,880<br>To do that, we use a function called grades.keys.</p>
<p>603<br>00:33:44,880 –&gt; 00:33:50,600<br>And this grades.keys function here doesn’t mutate the dictionary at all, but instead it</p>
<p>604<br>00:33:50,600 –&gt; 00:33:57,880<br>returns for me an iterable, a sequence of values, which are all the keys in my dictionary.</p>
<p>605<br>00:33:57,880 –&gt; 00:34:04,200<br>Now the data type of this return value is called Dict underscore keys.</p>
<p>606<br>00:34:04,200 –&gt; 00:34:06,880<br>It’s not a data type we’ve worked with before.</p>
<p>607<br>00:34:06,880 –&gt; 00:34:09,200<br>It looks really weird.</p>
<p>608<br>00:34:09,200 –&gt; 00:34:14,380<br>But if you’d like, and you don’t have to do this, you can always cast this sequence of values</p>
<p>609<br>00:34:14,380 –&gt; 00:34:18,160<br>that’s type Dict keys to a list like this.</p>
<p>610<br>00:34:18,160 –&gt; 00:34:24,240<br>So if you cast to a list grades.keys, it gives for us this more recognizable list with</p>
<p>611<br>00:34:24,240 –&gt; 00:34:28,760<br>each key being an element in the list.</p>
<p>612<br>00:34:28,760 –&gt; 00:34:33,640<br>You don’t have to do this, but if it makes it easier for you, you can.</p>
<p>613<br>00:34:33,639 –&gt; 00:34:37,039<br>So this line of code here, grades.keys returns for you.</p>
<p>614<br>00:34:37,039 –&gt; 00:34:41,440<br>You can think of it like this, iterable, this list of all the keys in the dictionary.</p>
<p>615<br>00:34:41,440 –&gt; 00:34:42,920<br>Again, they’re not ordered, right?</p>
<p>616<br>00:34:42,920 –&gt; 00:34:46,519<br>I mean, they’re ordered in the order that I added them into the dictionary, right?</p>
<p>617<br>00:34:46,519 –&gt; 00:34:48,400<br>Anna then Matt then John then Katie.</p>
<p>618<br>00:34:48,400 –&gt; 00:34:50,960<br>But they’re not sorted in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>619<br>00:34:50,960 –&gt; 00:34:54,079<br>If you have integers, they won’t be sorted in ascending or descending order.</p>
<p>620<br>00:34:54,079 –&gt; 00:34:58,759<br>So it’s best to just not assume an order to begin with.</p>
<p>621<br>00:34:58,759 –&gt; 00:35:03,359<br>Similarly, we can get an iterable of all the values in the dictionary.</p>
<p>622<br>00:35:03,360 –&gt; 00:35:08,360<br>And to do this, no surprise there, we use grades.values.</p>
<p>623<br>00:35:08,360 –&gt; 00:35:12,840<br>And this is again a function where it doesn’t mutate the grades at all, but instead it gets</p>
<p>624<br>00:35:12,840 –&gt; 00:35:16,680<br>replaced with this Dict values data type.</p>
<p>625<br>00:35:16,680 –&gt; 00:35:18,640<br>Never seen it before either.</p>
<p>626<br>00:35:18,640 –&gt; 00:35:22,680<br>And you can cast it to a list if you’d like because it makes more sense to us at this</p>
<p>627<br>00:35:22,680 –&gt; 00:35:28,840<br>point in time, which just returns for us this list of every single value in my dictionary.</p>
<p>628<br>00:35:28,840 –&gt; 00:35:30,160<br>Again, no order, right?</p>
<p>629<br>00:35:30,159 –&gt; 00:35:37,159<br>We can see that there’s no order except for the order that we actually added the element.</p>
<p>630<br>00:35:37,159 –&gt; 00:35:38,159<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>631<br>00:35:38,159 –&gt; 00:35:42,159<br>When you said like an act like a bubble, do you mean like if I do grade something,</p>
<p>632<br>00:35:42,159 –&gt; 00:35:47,159<br>another time you’ll print out the same list?</p>
<p>633<br>00:35:47,159 –&gt; 00:35:51,399<br>Yeah, yeah, and print out the same, the same, iterable, I guess.</p>
<p>634<br>00:35:51,399 –&gt; 00:35:52,399<br>If you do it again, yeah.</p>
<p>635<br>00:35:52,399 –&gt; 00:35:59,639<br>If you’re just iterating, or the dictionary, there can be chances for like to come up to the order.</p>
<p>636<br>00:35:59,639 –&gt; 00:36:05,199<br>If you’re iterating over the dictionary, not in the Python version we’re using, but in a</p>
<p>637<br>00:36:05,199 –&gt; 00:36:09,920<br>previous version, if you ran, you know, you’re on your machine, or if I ran the same code</p>
<p>638<br>00:36:09,920 –&gt; 00:36:15,359<br>on my machine, it might have given me a different order.</p>
<p>639<br>00:36:15,359 –&gt; 00:36:18,679<br>But in the versions we’re using from now on in Python, right?</p>
<p>640<br>00:36:18,679 –&gt; 00:36:22,759<br>Because you guys all probably downloaded the latest version of, you know, an Aconda and</p>
<p>641<br>00:36:22,759 –&gt; 00:36:28,159<br>Spyder, it will guarantee the order that you inserted the elements in.</p>
<p>642<br>00:36:28,159 –&gt; 00:36:32,839<br>But if somebody using an older version of Python takes your code and runs it, they might</p>
<p>643<br>00:36:32,839 –&gt; 00:36:40,719<br>actually get, you know, AAB, B, or some other order for these functions here.</p>
<p>644<br>00:36:40,719 –&gt; 00:36:43,920<br>Yeah, you’re welcome.</p>
<p>645<br>00:36:43,920 –&gt; 00:36:52,159<br>So these being iterable just means that we can have something like 4k in grades.keys,</p>
<p>646<br>00:36:52,159 –&gt; 00:37:01,039<br>basically giving us a loop where k is going to be each element in this list.</p>
<p>647<br>00:37:01,039 –&gt; 00:37:01,879<br>So that’s fine.</p>
<p>648<br>00:37:01,879 –&gt; 00:37:05,440<br>So we can iterate over the keys, or we can iterate over the values directly.</p>
<p>649<br>00:37:05,440 –&gt; 00:37:11,519<br>But what I find personally most effective is to iterate over each entry in the dictionary.</p>
<p>650<br>00:37:11,519 –&gt; 00:37:17,139<br>So not just over the keys or the values by themselves, it’s to iterate over the keys and the</p>
<p>651<br>00:37:17,139 –&gt; 00:37:19,159<br>values together.</p>
<p>652<br>00:37:19,159 –&gt; 00:37:26,079<br>So to do that, we use this function called grades.items.</p>
<p>653<br>00:37:26,079 –&gt; 00:37:31,399<br>And unsurprisingly, this will return also an iterable where each element in my iterable</p>
<p>654<br>00:37:31,399 –&gt; 00:37:38,480<br>is not just the key or the value, it’s a tuple of the key comma, the value.</p>
<p>655<br>00:37:38,480 –&gt; 00:37:42,799<br>And again, we can cast it to a list to give us something that’s more recognizable.</p>
<p>656<br>00:37:42,799 –&gt; 00:37:47,199<br>You can see now each element in the returned list is going to be the tuple where I have</p>
<p>657<br>00:37:47,199 –&gt; 00:37:48,199<br>an entry, right?</p>
<p>658<br>00:37:48,199 –&gt; 00:37:53,159<br>So my entry and a comma be is this first element in my returned list and then mat a and</p>
<p>659<br>00:37:53,159 –&gt; 00:37:54,359<br>then John B and then KDA.</p>
<p>660<br>00:37:54,359 –&gt; 00:37:59,960<br>So I grab these entries together where I have access to both the key and the value for</p>
<p>661<br>00:37:59,960 –&gt; 00:38:01,399<br>that entry.</p>
<p>662<br>00:38:01,399 –&gt; 00:38:05,559<br>Which means, and this is the important part, that we can do something like this.</p>
<p>663<br>00:38:05,559 –&gt; 00:38:08,279<br>And we can do this for the previous slide as well.</p>
<p>664<br>00:38:08,279 –&gt; 00:38:17,039<br>But for this particular grades.items iteration, if we’re grabbing a key value pair out of</p>
<p>665<br>00:38:17,039 –&gt; 00:38:23,880<br>items, that means we can do something like this for K comma V in grades.items.</p>
<p>666<br>00:38:23,880 –&gt; 00:38:30,759<br>Means that Python will map K to the key for that entry and V to the value for that entry,</p>
<p>667<br>00:38:30,759 –&gt; 00:38:34,400<br>as I’m iterating over each one of these pairs.</p>
<p>668<br>00:38:34,400 –&gt; 00:38:39,360<br>So with each iteration, I have access to both the key and the value for that entry, which</p>
<p>669<br>00:38:39,360 –&gt; 00:38:41,759<br>is pretty useful.</p>
<p>670<br>00:38:41,760 –&gt; 00:38:49,200<br>So if I have this line of code here, if I print K has value V, the K and the V will change</p>
<p>671<br>00:38:49,200 –&gt; 00:38:50,600<br>with each entry, right?</p>
<p>672<br>00:38:50,600 –&gt; 00:38:53,440<br>And I’m just grabbing both the key and the value for that entry.</p>
<p>673<br>00:38:53,440 –&gt; 00:38:54,440<br>Yeah, question.</p>
<p>674<br>00:38:54,440 –&gt; 00:38:56,440<br>You use the greatest item.</p>
<p>675<br>00:38:56,440 –&gt; 00:38:59,400<br>It’s actually like, it’s actually tuple, like the actual item.</p>
<p>676<br>00:38:59,400 –&gt; 00:39:00,400<br>It’s not a tuple.</p>
<p>677<br>00:39:00,400 –&gt; 00:39:05,160<br>So the actual object type is this thing, dict underscore items.</p>
<p>678<br>00:39:05,160 –&gt; 00:39:09,480<br>So again, not a type that we’ve worked with before, but that’s just the type, right?</p>
<p>679<br>00:39:09,480 –&gt; 00:39:14,960<br>We’ve seen lists, tuples, dictionaries, dict underscore items is another data type.</p>
<p>680<br>00:39:14,960 –&gt; 00:39:15,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>681<br>00:39:15,960 –&gt; 00:39:17,719<br>But the cool thing is that it’s an iterable.</p>
<p>682<br>00:39:17,719 –&gt; 00:39:22,519<br>So it’s a sequence of values, which means that you can cast it to a list, which is also</p>
<p>683<br>00:39:22,519 –&gt; 00:39:25,240<br>a sequence of values in and knows how to do that casting.</p>
<p>684<br>00:39:25,240 –&gt; 00:39:30,519<br>And you get the more recognizable list that we’ve been using.</p>
<p>685<br>00:39:30,519 –&gt; 00:39:32,039<br>Other questions?</p>
<p>686<br>00:39:32,039 –&gt; 00:39:37,519<br>Okay, so I really like using grades.items to iterate over entries.</p>
<p>687<br>00:39:37,519 –&gt; 00:39:39,280<br>So let’s have you try this exercise.</p>
<p>688<br>00:39:39,280 –&gt; 00:39:42,560<br>So it’s a function called count matches.</p>
<p>689<br>00:39:42,560 –&gt; 00:39:46,560<br>It takes in one dictionary, d.</p>
<p>690<br>00:39:46,560 –&gt; 00:39:50,400<br>I didn’t say what the elements are, but you can mix and match.</p>
<p>691<br>00:39:50,400 –&gt; 00:39:54,120<br>So here I have a dictionary with just mapped to ints.</p>
<p>692<br>00:39:54,120 –&gt; 00:39:59,080<br>And here I’ve got a dictionary where it maps ints and strings and things like that.</p>
<p>693<br>00:39:59,080 –&gt; 00:40:04,240<br>And what I want this function to do is tell me how many entries in this input dictionaries</p>
<p>694<br>00:40:04,240 –&gt; 00:40:06,880<br>have the key match its value.</p>
<p>695<br>00:40:06,880 –&gt; 00:40:12,800<br>So here, in this first example, the key here is one, the values two, so they don’t match.</p>
<p>696<br>00:40:12,800 –&gt; 00:40:16,200<br>These don’t match and these don’t match, so the count should be zero.</p>
<p>697<br>00:40:16,200 –&gt; 00:40:20,400<br>But down here in this example, the one doesn’t match two, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>698<br>00:40:20,400 –&gt; 00:40:27,039<br>But the key A matches its value, one count, key five matches its value, two counts.</p>
<p>699<br>00:40:27,039 –&gt; 00:40:31,360<br>So this should return count to.</p>
<p>700<br>00:40:31,360 –&gt; 00:40:36,720<br>All right, let’s have you work on that down by line 137.</p>
<p>701<br>00:40:36,719 –&gt; 00:40:41,199<br>And then we’ll write it together.</p>
<p>702<br>00:40:41,199 –&gt; 00:40:45,159<br>All right, how could I start this?</p>
<p>703<br>00:40:45,159 –&gt; 00:40:47,159<br>Yes.</p>
<p>704<br>00:40:47,159 –&gt; 00:40:49,519<br>Account, yes?</p>
<p>705<br>00:40:49,519 –&gt; 00:40:50,019<br>Zero?</p>
<p>706<br>00:40:50,019 –&gt; 00:40:51,119<br>Yep.</p>
<p>707<br>00:40:51,119 –&gt; 00:40:52,359<br>A for loop.</p>
<p>708<br>00:40:52,359 –&gt; 00:40:53,359<br>A for loop, yep.</p>
<p>709<br>00:41:00,559 –&gt; 00:41:02,359<br>Yep, as a function, yep.</p>
<p>710<br>00:41:02,360 –&gt; 00:41:07,039<br>V equal k, yep.</p>
<p>711<br>00:41:07,039 –&gt; 00:41:14,079<br>So this is where my value equals my key for that particular entry.</p>
<p>712<br>00:41:14,079 –&gt; 00:41:18,280<br>Count equals count plus one, perfect.</p>
<p>713<br>00:41:18,280 –&gt; 00:41:21,440<br>Yep, return count.</p>
<p>714<br>00:41:21,440 –&gt; 00:41:23,680<br>Did anybody do it a different way?</p>
<p>715<br>00:41:23,680 –&gt; 00:41:27,559<br>Nope, okay, awesome.</p>
<p>716<br>00:41:27,559 –&gt; 00:41:28,559<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>717<br>00:41:28,559 –&gt; 00:41:35,840<br>Why do you have to call it like, so we added a derivative, why is it not so correct?</p>
<p>718<br>00:41:35,840 –&gt; 00:41:36,840<br>We can write it, yeah.</p>
<p>719<br>00:41:36,840 –&gt; 00:41:42,159<br>Yeah, I did, like, the count equals zero, and then I did like, for x, and it thinks, like,</p>
<p>720<br>00:41:42,159 –&gt; 00:41:48,079<br>that it was just going to call it the value, and say, I got to take both x and, like,</p>
<p>721<br>00:41:48,079 –&gt; 00:41:49,079<br>that, it counts.</p>
<p>722<br>00:41:49,079 –&gt; 00:41:52,079<br>I got to know that it was going to call it.</p>
<p>723<br>00:41:52,079 –&gt; 00:41:56,480<br>Yeah, so we can say for xnd.keys or something like that, right?</p>
<p>724<br>00:41:56,480 –&gt; 00:41:59,199<br>Something like that or no?</p>
<p>725<br>00:41:59,199 –&gt; 00:42:03,880<br>We can also say for xnd, I think, that might work too, because it will grab the key for</p>
<p>726<br>00:42:03,880 –&gt; 00:42:07,920<br>us, but just to be safe, keys.</p>
<p>727<br>00:42:07,920 –&gt; 00:42:11,800<br>And now we need to grab the value, so how do you grab the value associated with kx?</p>
<p>728<br>00:42:11,800 –&gt; 00:42:19,079<br>Yeah, score bracket, it’s just indexing, right?</p>
<p>729<br>00:42:19,079 –&gt; 00:42:26,440<br>So d-score brackets x, oops, if d-score brackets x equals, so that’s the value.</p>
<p>730<br>00:42:26,440 –&gt; 00:42:30,240<br>Value equals the key, right?</p>
<p>731<br>00:42:30,240 –&gt; 00:42:33,920<br>Then again, we, you know, count plus one.</p>
<p>732<br>00:42:33,920 –&gt; 00:42:37,400<br>So this is the other way.</p>
<p>733<br>00:42:37,400 –&gt; 00:42:45,119<br>Yeah, so we don’t have to use items, but it just, items makes things easier because we</p>
<p>734<br>00:42:45,119 –&gt; 00:42:50,039<br>have in hand a variable that’s, you know, the value and the variable that’s the key, and</p>
<p>735<br>00:42:50,039 –&gt; 00:43:00,159<br>doing things like indexing starts to get confusing if, you know, I mean, it can be confusing.</p>
<p>736<br>00:43:00,159 –&gt; 00:43:05,759<br>But yeah, both ways are very valid, so let’s run it, and it should work.</p>
<p>737<br>00:43:05,759 –&gt; 00:43:10,239<br>Yeah, so the first count is zero, as we expected, and the second count is two.</p>
<p>738<br>00:43:10,239 –&gt; 00:43:13,119<br>Is that any questions about this code?</p>
<p>739<br>00:43:13,119 –&gt; 00:43:14,119<br>Does it make sense?</p>
<p>740<br>00:43:14,119 –&gt; 00:43:17,840<br>Is there another way that somebody tried it?</p>
<p>741<br>00:43:17,840 –&gt; 00:43:24,840<br>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>742<br>00:43:24,840 –&gt; 00:43:31,960<br>Okay, so dictionaries are mutable objects, right?</p>
<p>743<br>00:43:31,960 –&gt; 00:43:34,880<br>So all the aliasing and cloning rules apply.</p>
<p>744<br>00:43:34,880 –&gt; 00:43:41,760<br>Remember when we talked about lists and using the equal sign between a list and another</p>
<p>745<br>00:43:41,760 –&gt; 00:43:43,880<br>variable name?</p>
<p>746<br>00:43:43,880 –&gt; 00:43:48,920<br>Just a plain old equal sign means that you are making an alias for that list.</p>
<p>747<br>00:43:48,920 –&gt; 00:43:50,480<br>Same thing applies to dictionaries.</p>
<p>748<br>00:43:50,480 –&gt; 00:43:55,200<br>So using, you know, saying d1 equals d2, where d2 is a dictionary means that you’ve just</p>
<p>749<br>00:43:55,200 –&gt; 00:43:57,440<br>created an alias for that dictionary.</p>
<p>750<br>00:43:57,440 –&gt; 00:44:01,760<br>So if you change the dictionary through either of those variables, you’re changing the object</p>
<p>751<br>00:44:01,760 –&gt; 00:44:03,160<br>itself.</p>
<p>752<br>00:44:03,160 –&gt; 00:44:07,760<br>If you want to actually make a copy, you use d.copy, where d is the name of the dictionary.</p>
<p>753<br>00:44:07,760 –&gt; 00:44:11,360<br>You’d like a copy, and that gets you a copy of that dictionary, and then you can change</p>
<p>754<br>00:44:11,720 –&gt; 00:44:15,320<br>it without changing the original one.</p>
<p>755<br>00:44:15,320 –&gt; 00:44:19,840<br>So let’s talk a little bit about the values for a dictionary and the keys, because there</p>
<p>756<br>00:44:19,840 –&gt; 00:44:23,559<br>are some restrictions on the keys for the dictionary.</p>
<p>757<br>00:44:23,559 –&gt; 00:44:25,559<br>No restrictions on the values.</p>
<p>758<br>00:44:25,559 –&gt; 00:44:28,400<br>So dictionary values can be any type, right?</p>
<p>759<br>00:44:28,400 –&gt; 00:44:32,840<br>You can have a dictionary value that’s a float, int, string, tuple.</p>
<p>760<br>00:44:32,840 –&gt; 00:44:36,200<br>You can have a dictionary value that’s a list, right, which is a mutable object.</p>
<p>761<br>00:44:36,200 –&gt; 00:44:39,720<br>You could have a dictionary value that’s another dictionary.</p>
<p>762<br>00:44:39,719 –&gt; 00:44:43,279<br>All are okay, whatever you’d like for the values to be.</p>
<p>763<br>00:44:43,279 –&gt; 00:44:47,759<br>You can have dictionary values that are duplicates, so you can have one key that maps to value</p>
<p>764<br>00:44:47,759 –&gt; 00:44:51,359<br>five, another key that maps to value five.</p>
<p>765<br>00:44:51,359 –&gt; 00:44:52,839<br>All good.</p>
<p>766<br>00:44:52,839 –&gt; 00:44:53,839<br>Okay.</p>
<p>767<br>00:44:53,839 –&gt; 00:44:57,359<br>So the key, so the values don’t need to be unique.</p>
<p>768<br>00:44:57,359 –&gt; 00:45:00,719<br>We do have restrictions on the keys though.</p>
<p>769<br>00:45:00,719 –&gt; 00:45:05,359<br>The first restriction on the keys is that it has to be unique, right?</p>
<p>770<br>00:45:05,360 –&gt; 00:45:17,440<br>So if you’re mapping a key one to value five, you cannot map a key one to value six, because</p>
<p>771<br>00:45:17,440 –&gt; 00:45:23,200<br>if you go and look up the value associated with one, how does Python know which value you’d</p>
<p>772<br>00:45:23,200 –&gt; 00:45:26,400<br>like, the five or the six, right?</p>
<p>773<br>00:45:26,400 –&gt; 00:45:30,400<br>So the keys have to be unique, first of all.</p>
<p>774<br>00:45:30,400 –&gt; 00:45:37,200<br>Back in, the keys have to be immutable, technically hashable, but for the purposes of this class,</p>
<p>775<br>00:45:37,200 –&gt; 00:45:39,720<br>just think of them as having to be immutable.</p>
<p>776<br>00:45:39,720 –&gt; 00:45:44,480<br>So a key can only be one of these types that we’ve seen so far, int, float, string, tuple,</p>
<p>777<br>00:45:44,480 –&gt; 00:45:45,400<br>or bool.</p>
<p>778<br>00:45:45,400 –&gt; 00:45:48,920<br>You cannot have a key that’s a list, you cannot have a key that’s a dictionary, because</p>
<p>779<br>00:45:48,920 –&gt; 00:45:51,800<br>they’re mutable objects.</p>
<p>780<br>00:45:51,800 –&gt; 00:45:56,400<br>So let’s look at that a little bit further in detail.</p>
<p>781<br>00:45:56,400 –&gt; 00:46:03,840<br>So the reason why we can’t have a key that is mutable is because of the way keys are stored</p>
<p>782<br>00:46:03,840 –&gt; 00:46:08,639<br>in Python, sorry, the way the dictionaries are stored in Python.</p>
<p>783<br>00:46:08,639 –&gt; 00:46:10,760<br>So I’m going to show you an example on the next slide.</p>
<p>784<br>00:46:10,760 –&gt; 00:46:14,200<br>First I’m going to explain how they’re stored, and then we’ll go through an example showing</p>
<p>785<br>00:46:14,200 –&gt; 00:46:19,639<br>you exactly why you can’t have a mutable structure.</p>
<p>786<br>00:46:19,639 –&gt; 00:46:25,559<br>So the way the way dictionaries are stored in Python is you first need a key, right, to</p>
<p>787<br>00:46:25,559 –&gt; 00:46:27,119<br>associate with a value.</p>
<p>788<br>00:46:27,119 –&gt; 00:46:31,440<br>So everything starts off with the key you’d like to add to your dictionary.</p>
<p>789<br>00:46:31,440 –&gt; 00:46:38,159<br>So Python basically runs a function called a hash function on the key.</p>
<p>790<br>00:46:38,159 –&gt; 00:46:41,360<br>For simplicity sake, let’s say the key you’re trying to store is a number.</p>
<p>791<br>00:46:41,360 –&gt; 00:46:46,079<br>That hash function might return that same number, it might return something else.</p>
<p>792<br>00:46:46,079 –&gt; 00:46:51,159<br>If you’re trying to store a string as a key, Python again runs maybe a different hash</p>
<p>793<br>00:46:51,159 –&gt; 00:46:56,279<br>function that takes in that string, which might be a bunch of characters, and it converts</p>
<p>794<br>00:46:56,279 –&gt; 00:46:57,879<br>it to some number.</p>
<p>795<br>00:46:57,879 –&gt; 00:47:05,079<br>So the hash function always takes in your key and converts it to a number.</p>
<p>796<br>00:47:05,079 –&gt; 00:47:10,359<br>That number, think of it like representing a memory location where you’re going to store</p>
<p>797<br>00:47:10,359 –&gt; 00:47:13,799<br>the value associated with that key.</p>
<p>798<br>00:47:13,799 –&gt; 00:47:19,480<br>So you’re always grabbing a number that represents a memory location.</p>
<p>799<br>00:47:19,480 –&gt; 00:47:22,320<br>At that memory location, you’ll store the value.</p>
<p>800<br>00:47:22,320 –&gt; 00:47:26,840<br>So next time you want to look up the value associated with a key, you just run that same</p>
<p>801<br>00:47:26,840 –&gt; 00:47:27,840<br>hash function.</p>
<p>802<br>00:47:27,840 –&gt; 00:47:29,840<br>The function won’t change.</p>
<p>803<br>00:47:29,840 –&gt; 00:47:33,960<br>You run the same hash function on your object and you’ll be able to get that same integer</p>
<p>804<br>00:47:33,960 –&gt; 00:47:34,960<br>back.</p>
<p>805<br>00:47:34,960 –&gt; 00:47:37,440<br>You’ll be able to grab that same value back.</p>
<p>806<br>00:47:37,440 –&gt; 00:47:41,519<br>But if you’re storing mutable objects, that means that object can change.</p>
<p>807<br>00:47:41,519 –&gt; 00:47:45,920<br>So if you run the hash function, the thing that gives you a number on something that’s</p>
<p>808<br>00:47:45,920 –&gt; 00:47:50,240<br>changed, that number might not be the same.</p>
<p>809<br>00:47:50,240 –&gt; 00:47:55,000<br>Because you’ve changed the thing that you’re passing into the function, so why would it</p>
<p>810<br>00:47:55,000 –&gt; 00:47:57,400<br>give you the same value back?</p>
<p>811<br>00:47:57,400 –&gt; 00:47:58,880<br>So let’s look at this example.</p>
<p>812<br>00:47:58,880 –&gt; 00:48:00,800<br>So again, we’re storing grades.</p>
<p>813<br>00:48:00,800 –&gt; 00:48:04,200<br>And let’s say we’re trying to store a bunch of grades inside our memory.</p>
<p>814<br>00:48:04,200 –&gt; 00:48:10,400<br>And let’s say our memory is just 16 locations, so 0 through 15.</p>
<p>815<br>00:48:10,400 –&gt; 00:48:14,920<br>So at these locations, I’m going to store grades associated with a person.</p>
<p>816<br>00:48:14,920 –&gt; 00:48:19,920<br>The function I’m going to run on the student is using their name.</p>
<p>817<br>00:48:19,920 –&gt; 00:48:23,680<br>So I’m going to store Anna’s grade somewhere.</p>
<p>818<br>00:48:23,680 –&gt; 00:48:29,920<br>But I need to run a function that takes in the string A and A and gets for me a number.</p>
<p>819<br>00:48:29,920 –&gt; 00:48:32,680<br>That number is where I’m going to store my grade.</p>
<p>820<br>00:48:32,680 –&gt; 00:48:37,960<br>So a simple hash function we might do is to say, well, I’m going to take A and map it</p>
<p>821<br>00:48:37,960 –&gt; 00:48:41,760<br>to 1, B, map it to 2, C, map it to 3, and so on.</p>
<p>822<br>00:48:41,760 –&gt; 00:48:48,760<br>I can sum all of those numbers associated with my letters in my name, 16.</p>
<p>823<br>00:48:48,760 –&gt; 00:48:54,160<br>And then I can mod it with 16, which is how many entries I have in my memory.</p>
<p>824<br>00:48:54,160 –&gt; 00:48:58,760<br>So if I mod it with 16, that’s going to give me a number 0 through 15.</p>
<p>825<br>00:48:58,760 –&gt; 00:49:03,360<br>If you take the remainder when you divide by 16, you’ll either get 0 all the way up through</p>
<p>826<br>00:49:03,360 –&gt; 00:49:04,640<br>15.</p>
<p>827<br>00:49:04,639 –&gt; 00:49:13,639<br>So if I mod my name, that means I’m going to store my grade at a memory location 0.</p>
<p>828<br>00:49:13,639 –&gt; 00:49:16,079<br>So far so good.</p>
<p>829<br>00:49:16,079 –&gt; 00:49:21,440<br>So I’m basically, I made up this hash function that tells me where to put my grade.</p>
<p>830<br>00:49:21,440 –&gt; 00:49:23,440<br>Now I add another person.</p>
<p>831<br>00:49:23,440 –&gt; 00:49:28,639<br>Again, I’m going to convert the letters in their name to numbers so that I can easily get</p>
<p>832<br>00:49:28,639 –&gt; 00:49:32,039<br>a number out of their letters.</p>
<p>833<br>00:49:32,039 –&gt; 00:49:37,039<br>So I’m basically hashing their letters to a number.</p>
<p>834<br>00:49:37,039 –&gt; 00:49:41,320<br>Again summing this for Eric is 35, I’m going to mod it with 16, which means I’m going</p>
<p>835<br>00:49:41,320 –&gt; 00:49:45,719<br>to put Eric’s grade at location 3.</p>
<p>836<br>00:49:45,719 –&gt; 00:49:47,360<br>Next person, John, same thing.</p>
<p>837<br>00:49:47,360 –&gt; 00:49:51,880<br>I add the numbers, mod 16, I’m going to put John at location 15.</p>
<p>838<br>00:49:51,880 –&gt; 00:49:56,719<br>So this is my memory where I’m storing the values associated with these students.</p>
<p>839<br>00:49:56,719 –&gt; 00:50:03,079<br>So if I want to grab back my grade, I run the exact same hash function.</p>
<p>840<br>00:50:03,079 –&gt; 00:50:05,799<br>So I’m going to run the same hash function on my name.</p>
<p>841<br>00:50:05,799 –&gt; 00:50:07,039<br>My name hasn’t changed, right?</p>
<p>842<br>00:50:07,039 –&gt; 00:50:08,239<br>It’s still the string.</p>
<p>843<br>00:50:08,239 –&gt; 00:50:10,639<br>I’m not allowed to change it because it’s a string.</p>
<p>844<br>00:50:10,639 –&gt; 00:50:13,599<br>And so I’m going to get the same value back 0.</p>
<p>845<br>00:50:13,599 –&gt; 00:50:17,759<br>So that means to grab the letter associated with my name, I just need to go straight into</p>
<p>846<br>00:50:17,759 –&gt; 00:50:23,879<br>my memory location and look up the value at that memory location.</p>
<p>847<br>00:50:23,879 –&gt; 00:50:26,480<br>So I know it’s going to be a C.</p>
<p>848<br>00:50:26,480 –&gt; 00:50:35,320<br>Now let’s say I’m storing a list, a student name as a list.</p>
<p>849<br>00:50:35,320 –&gt; 00:50:38,840<br>So again, Anna, Eric and John are immutable, right?</p>
<p>850<br>00:50:38,840 –&gt; 00:50:40,119<br>They will not change.</p>
<p>851<br>00:50:40,119 –&gt; 00:50:43,760<br>But if I store Kate as a list, her name might change.</p>
<p>852<br>00:50:43,760 –&gt; 00:50:46,800<br>Again, I can run the same hash function on her name.</p>
<p>853<br>00:50:46,800 –&gt; 00:50:51,679<br>That means her grade when I first store it is going to be at location 5.</p>
<p>854<br>00:50:51,679 –&gt; 00:50:54,800<br>So I’m storing Kate at location 5.</p>
<p>855<br>00:50:54,800 –&gt; 00:51:00,320<br>All these three strings, I know I can get back because they cannot change.</p>
<p>856<br>00:51:00,320 –&gt; 00:51:05,880<br>But let’s say that Kate goes and changes her name with a K to Kate with a C.</p>
<p>857<br>00:51:05,880 –&gt; 00:51:08,760<br>It’s the same object, right?</p>
<p>858<br>00:51:08,760 –&gt; 00:51:12,600<br>The same person, she earned her grade B originally.</p>
<p>859<br>00:51:12,600 –&gt; 00:51:17,200<br>So if I want to grab her grade back, even though her name has changed, I would still like</p>
<p>860<br>00:51:17,200 –&gt; 00:51:21,600<br>to grab the B associated with her as a person.</p>
<p>861<br>00:51:21,599 –&gt; 00:51:29,119<br>But Kate with a C, if I run that same hash function that I ran to put her grade in my table,</p>
<p>862<br>00:51:29,119 –&gt; 00:51:34,079<br>tells me that I now need to look up her grade at memory location 13.</p>
<p>863<br>00:51:34,079 –&gt; 00:51:38,199<br>No longer at memory location 5.</p>
<p>864<br>00:51:38,199 –&gt; 00:51:41,880<br>She’s not there.</p>
<p>865<br>00:51:41,880 –&gt; 00:51:45,039<br>So now it’s like, did the student disappear?</p>
<p>866<br>00:51:45,039 –&gt; 00:51:46,839<br>All that stuff.</p>
<p>867<br>00:51:46,840 –&gt; 00:51:54,280<br>So you see now that’s the reason why I cannot have a mutable object as a key to my list.</p>
<p>868<br>00:51:54,280 –&gt; 00:51:58,960<br>Because if that object changes running that hash function on that changed object, might</p>
<p>869<br>00:51:58,960 –&gt; 00:52:03,440<br>not give me the same memory location where I originally stored the value associated with</p>
<p>870<br>00:52:03,440 –&gt; 00:52:06,000<br>that object.</p>
<p>871<br>00:52:06,000 –&gt; 00:52:08,440<br>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>872<br>00:52:08,440 –&gt; 00:52:09,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>873<br>00:52:09,960 –&gt; 00:52:12,360<br>So let’s revisit our original example.</p>
<p>874<br>00:52:12,360 –&gt; 00:52:16,920<br>The one where we tried to store everything in a master list, all these grades in a master</p>
<p>875<br>00:52:16,920 –&gt; 00:52:18,240<br>list.</p>
<p>876<br>00:52:18,240 –&gt; 00:52:22,320<br>Now let’s store it in a master dictionary.</p>
<p>877<br>00:52:22,320 –&gt; 00:52:27,160<br>So I’ve got my grades, notice curly bracket, curly bracket is a dictionary.</p>
<p>878<br>00:52:27,160 –&gt; 00:52:31,440<br>I’ve got two students in my class, Anna, right?</p>
<p>879<br>00:52:31,440 –&gt; 00:52:33,400<br>So this is Anna’s information and Bob.</p>
<p>880<br>00:52:33,400 –&gt; 00:52:37,079<br>That’s Bob’s information.</p>
<p>881<br>00:52:37,079 –&gt; 00:52:39,840<br>So just two students in my master dictionary.</p>
<p>882<br>00:52:39,840 –&gt; 00:52:45,760<br>So the key Anna is going to be one entry, one entry key.</p>
<p>883<br>00:52:45,760 –&gt; 00:52:48,000<br>Key Bob is the other entry key.</p>
<p>884<br>00:52:48,000 –&gt; 00:52:51,000<br>And what’s the information associated with these keys?</p>
<p>885<br>00:52:51,000 –&gt; 00:52:55,800<br>Well with Anna, I’ve got this dictionary associated with her name.</p>
<p>886<br>00:52:55,800 –&gt; 00:52:57,360<br>So that’s this big thing here.</p>
<p>887<br>00:52:57,360 –&gt; 00:52:59,240<br>I’ll explain it in a bit.</p>
<p>888<br>00:52:59,240 –&gt; 00:53:03,519<br>And similarly with Bob, Bob has one thing associated with him.</p>
<p>889<br>00:53:03,519 –&gt; 00:53:07,720<br>And it’s another dictionary.</p>
<p>890<br>00:53:07,719 –&gt; 00:53:10,879<br>So I’m mapping strings to dictionaries here.</p>
<p>891<br>00:53:10,879 –&gt; 00:53:16,119<br>And that’s fine because values in a dictionary can be other dictionaries.</p>
<p>892<br>00:53:16,119 –&gt; 00:53:19,519<br>So what are these dictionaries about?</p>
<p>893<br>00:53:19,519 –&gt; 00:53:25,359<br>Well, the number of items in the dictionary for a particular person, there’s three elements,</p>
<p>894<br>00:53:25,359 –&gt; 00:53:26,359<br>right?</p>
<p>895<br>00:53:26,359 –&gt; 00:53:28,559<br>So comma, comma separates my three elements.</p>
<p>896<br>00:53:28,559 –&gt; 00:53:32,439<br>The first one is going to be mapped with key MQ.</p>
<p>897<br>00:53:32,439 –&gt; 00:53:35,359<br>The second one mapped with key PS for problem set.</p>
<p>898<br>00:53:35,360 –&gt; 00:53:39,480<br>And the last one mapped with the string fin for final.</p>
<p>899<br>00:53:39,480 –&gt; 00:53:42,800<br>So each one of these students has this dictionary associated with them.</p>
<p>900<br>00:53:42,800 –&gt; 00:53:47,440<br>And that dictionary then itself has three entries, one for the micro quiz, one for the</p>
<p>901<br>00:53:47,440 –&gt; 00:53:51,079<br>PS one for the final scores.</p>
<p>902<br>00:53:51,079 –&gt; 00:53:54,440<br>So now what’s the values associated with those keys?</p>
<p>903<br>00:53:54,440 –&gt; 00:53:56,760<br>Well, the micro quiz is going to be a list.</p>
<p>904<br>00:53:56,760 –&gt; 00:53:58,440<br>The problem set is going to be a list.</p>
<p>905<br>00:53:58,440 –&gt; 00:54:00,480<br>And the final is going to be a string.</p>
<p>906<br>00:54:00,480 –&gt; 00:54:05,719<br>So a really nice representation of my class.</p>
<p>907<br>00:54:05,719 –&gt; 00:54:08,199<br>And same for Bob.</p>
<p>908<br>00:54:08,199 –&gt; 00:54:16,039<br>So now what if we want to grab a student’s exam grade or the student’s list of exam grades?</p>
<p>909<br>00:54:16,039 –&gt; 00:54:21,400<br>Remember that big function with the two nested four loops and the nested ifs?</p>
<p>910<br>00:54:21,400 –&gt; 00:54:25,480<br>That becomes this line.</p>
<p>911<br>00:54:25,480 –&gt; 00:54:28,880<br>Isn’t that cool?</p>
<p>912<br>00:54:28,880 –&gt; 00:54:29,880<br>I like that.</p>
<p>913<br>00:54:29,880 –&gt; 00:54:30,880<br>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>914<br>00:54:30,880 –&gt; 00:54:34,480<br>We should applaud this because look how easy it is now to grab.</p>
<p>915<br>00:54:34,480 –&gt; 00:54:35,480<br>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>916<br>00:54:35,480 –&gt; 00:54:36,480<br>Yes.</p>
<p>917<br>00:54:36,480 –&gt; 00:54:39,240<br>Dictionaries are awesome guys.</p>
<p>918<br>00:54:39,240 –&gt; 00:54:44,880<br>So yeah, so look, that line becomes this, you know, grabbing one, one quiz score becomes</p>
<p>919<br>00:54:44,880 –&gt; 00:54:47,720<br>this single line of code right here.</p>
<p>920<br>00:54:47,720 –&gt; 00:54:49,800<br>So let’s break it down.</p>
<p>921<br>00:54:49,800 –&gt; 00:54:54,880<br>Again we do left to right whenever we’ve got this chain of stuff going on.</p>
<p>922<br>00:54:54,880 –&gt; 00:54:59,320<br>So the first thing we say is, well, we’re looking upgrades at some index.</p>
<p>923<br>00:54:59,320 –&gt; 00:55:02,240<br>So grades at some index gives me that dictionary.</p>
<p>924<br>00:55:02,240 –&gt; 00:55:05,599<br>So something like this whole thing here.</p>
<p>925<br>00:55:05,599 –&gt; 00:55:06,599<br>Right.</p>
<p>926<br>00:55:06,599 –&gt; 00:55:07,599<br>Okay.</p>
<p>927<br>00:55:07,599 –&gt; 00:55:08,599<br>Good.</p>
<p>928<br>00:55:08,599 –&gt; 00:55:09,599<br>That’s first chain.</p>
<p>929<br>00:55:09,599 –&gt; 00:55:14,320<br>Now this box here gets replaced with that dictionary and I’m doing another index into</p>
<p>930<br>00:55:14,320 –&gt; 00:55:15,320<br>that dictionary.</p>
<p>931<br>00:55:15,320 –&gt; 00:55:23,640<br>So that means I’m going to grab the mq associated with that dictionary.</p>
<p>932<br>00:55:23,639 –&gt; 00:55:30,119<br>So the value associated with mq is going to be this list 544.</p>
<p>933<br>00:55:30,119 –&gt; 00:55:33,920<br>So this box here gets replaced with the list 544.</p>
<p>934<br>00:55:33,920 –&gt; 00:55:38,159<br>And then if I want to grab just the first quiz value, I say now I’m going to index in the</p>
<p>935<br>00:55:38,159 –&gt; 00:55:40,279<br>list 544 and index 0.</p>
<p>936<br>00:55:40,279 –&gt; 00:55:42,199<br>So that grabs for me just the 5.</p>
<p>937<br>00:55:42,199 –&gt; 00:55:45,879<br>So then the first quiz score for Anna was a 5.</p>
<p>938<br>00:55:45,879 –&gt; 00:55:49,440<br>That’s pretty bad.</p>
<p>939<br>00:55:49,440 –&gt; 00:55:53,480<br>Okay.</p>
<p>940<br>00:55:53,480 –&gt; 00:55:59,519<br>So let’s have you think about this.</p>
<p>941<br>00:55:59,519 –&gt; 00:56:01,400<br>This is a function.</p>
<p>942<br>00:56:01,400 –&gt; 00:56:03,320<br>Nothing to code here, just to think.</p>
<p>943<br>00:56:03,320 –&gt; 00:56:16,039<br>This is a function that grabs the average of every single thing where that thing is what</p>
<p>944<br>00:56:16,039 –&gt; 00:56:17,519<br>in the class.</p>
<p>945<br>00:56:17,519 –&gt; 00:56:24,199<br>So if what is mq as, you know, is in down here in this example, if what is mq, this code</p>
<p>946<br>00:56:24,199 –&gt; 00:56:29,519<br>is supposed to get the average of all of the micro quizzes for all the students in the class.</p>
<p>947<br>00:56:29,519 –&gt; 00:56:35,239<br>So you basically want to grab the average of 10 plus 8 plus 3.</p>
<p>948<br>00:56:35,239 –&gt; 00:56:39,920<br>And if it’s PS, I would like to grab the average of all the problem sets for all the students</p>
<p>949<br>00:56:39,920 –&gt; 00:56:40,920<br>in the class.</p>
<p>950<br>00:56:40,920 –&gt; 00:56:47,480<br>So the average of 10, 10, 7, 8, and 0.</p>
<p>951<br>00:56:47,480 –&gt; 00:56:51,679<br>So we’ve got a loop that goes through other students in the keys.</p>
<p>952<br>00:56:51,679 –&gt; 00:56:59,679<br>So the student studs, stud here is going to be this dictionary.</p>
<p>953<br>00:56:59,679 –&gt; 00:57:05,960<br>So given this dictionary, what line should you insert here such that you’re creating a</p>
<p>954<br>00:57:05,960 –&gt; 00:57:10,480<br>list, just a single top level list of all of the values in there.</p>
<p>955<br>00:57:10,480 –&gt; 00:57:14,480<br>So the thing you actually want to end up with, and if we’re looking at the PS scores, just</p>
<p>956<br>00:57:14,480 –&gt; 00:57:23,320<br>because it’s a little easier to think about, is going to be 10, 10, 7, 8, and 0.</p>
<p>957<br>00:57:23,320 –&gt; 00:57:28,199<br>So in the end, what I would like to get in my all data, this list that I’m maintaining</p>
<p>958<br>00:57:28,199 –&gt; 00:57:33,800<br>here, is something like this for the PS.</p>
<p>959<br>00:57:33,800 –&gt; 00:57:41,639<br>So think about which one of these lines will accomplish that.</p>
<p>960<br>00:57:41,639 –&gt; 00:57:50,119<br>And just to help you out, we can say student is my dictionary of who thinks it’s the first</p>
<p>961<br>00:57:50,119 –&gt; 00:58:02,920<br>one, second one, third one, fourth one.</p>
<p>962<br>00:58:02,920 –&gt; 00:58:07,799<br>Nobody thought it’s the first one, you guys sure?</p>
<p>963<br>00:58:07,799 –&gt; 00:58:09,839<br>Why do you think it’s the second one?</p>
<p>964<br>00:58:09,840 –&gt; 00:58:12,079<br>Is it because of the append?</p>
<p>965<br>00:58:12,079 –&gt; 00:58:13,079<br>Yeah?</p>
<p>966<br>00:58:13,079 –&gt; 00:58:14,079<br>Let’s think about it.</p>
<p>967<br>00:58:14,079 –&gt; 00:58:17,039<br>So all data is a list.</p>
<p>968<br>00:58:17,039 –&gt; 00:58:18,440<br>And what are we appending?</p>
<p>969<br>00:58:18,440 –&gt; 00:58:23,960<br>So what is data at stud at what going to give us?</p>
<p>970<br>00:58:23,960 –&gt; 00:58:30,240<br>Data at student is the dictionary, this dictionary here, right?</p>
<p>971<br>00:58:30,240 –&gt; 00:58:33,200<br>This value here.</p>
<p>972<br>00:58:33,200 –&gt; 00:58:38,880<br>And if we take this value and index into the what, will it be an integer or will it be</p>
<p>973<br>00:58:38,880 –&gt; 00:58:43,400<br>a list?</p>
<p>974<br>00:58:43,400 –&gt; 00:58:51,519<br>So when we append a list to another list, what is that going to give us?</p>
<p>975<br>00:58:51,519 –&gt; 00:58:58,440<br>So if we have a list already with ABC, if I append another list to this, will it put</p>
<p>976<br>00:58:58,440 –&gt; 00:59:01,800<br>the element within that list or the list itself?</p>
<p>977<br>00:59:01,800 –&gt; 00:59:06,039<br>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>978<br>00:59:06,039 –&gt; 00:59:08,840<br>So that’s not going to work for us.</p>
<p>979<br>00:59:08,840 –&gt; 00:59:11,720<br>Clearly, D is not right either.</p>
<p>980<br>00:59:11,720 –&gt; 00:59:17,120<br>And definitely indexing into data at student at what is not going to be right.</p>
<p>981<br>00:59:17,120 –&gt; 00:59:23,680<br>So that leaves one other choice, the first one.</p>
<p>982<br>00:59:23,680 –&gt; 00:59:27,039<br>So let’s see why the first one works.</p>
<p>983<br>00:59:27,039 –&gt; 00:59:28,480<br>We’re concatenating, right?</p>
<p>984<br>00:59:28,480 –&gt; 00:59:30,600<br>So the plus concatenates.</p>
<p>985<br>00:59:30,600 –&gt; 00:59:36,400<br>So let’s say I already have a list, ABC, I’m going to concatenate something I already</p>
<p>986<br>00:59:36,400 –&gt; 00:59:40,920<br>have with data at student at what, which we said is what?</p>
<p>987<br>00:59:40,920 –&gt; 00:59:43,599<br>Is it a single element or another list?</p>
<p>988<br>00:59:43,599 –&gt; 00:59:44,200<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>989<br>00:59:44,200 –&gt; 00:59:49,280<br>So we concatenate with something like 10, 10 or something like that.</p>
<p>990<br>00:59:49,280 –&gt; 00:59:57,280<br>So that will return for us, ABC, 10, 10, which will allow us to do something like getting</p>
<p>991<br>00:59:57,280 –&gt; 01:00:01,000<br>the sum of all these elements.</p>
<p>992<br>01:00:01,000 –&gt; 01:00:01,840<br>Questions about that?</p>
<p>993<br>01:00:01,840 –&gt; 01:00:02,680<br>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>994<br>01:00:02,680 –&gt; 01:00:03,639<br>Is that all right?</p>
<p>995<br>01:00:03,639 –&gt; 01:00:04,480<br>Yes.</p>
<p>996<br>01:00:04,480 –&gt; 01:00:08,480<br>So I didn’t mind.</p>
<p>997<br>01:00:08,480 –&gt; 01:00:10,480<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>998<br>01:00:10,480 –&gt; 01:00:11,480<br>But why would we?</p>
<p>999<br>01:00:18,480 –&gt; 01:00:24,320<br>Like, how come the element returns 10 to the empty?</p>
<p>1000<br>01:00:24,320 –&gt; 01:00:27,000<br>Because we’re indexing into mq.</p>
<p>1001<br>01:00:27,000 –&gt; 01:00:30,199<br>So if you index into mq, mq is your key.</p>
<p>1002<br>01:00:30,199 –&gt; 01:00:32,840<br>So you grab the value associated with that key.</p>
<p>1003<br>01:00:32,840 –&gt; 01:00:38,920<br>So that would be this list here, the 10 or for PS, it would be the list 10, 10.</p>
<p>1004<br>01:00:38,920 –&gt; 01:00:44,640<br>So quick recap on list’s indexionaries before we do one final longer example.</p>
<p>1005<br>01:00:44,640 –&gt; 01:00:47,760<br>So again, lists are ordered sequences of elements, right?</p>
<p>1006<br>01:00:47,760 –&gt; 01:00:49,880<br>There is some element at index 0.</p>
<p>1007<br>01:00:49,880 –&gt; 01:00:52,720<br>There’s some element in index 1, some element in index 2.</p>
<p>1008<br>01:00:52,720 –&gt; 01:00:56,880<br>So we do have these, quote unquote, indices, right?</p>
<p>1009<br>01:00:56,880 –&gt; 01:00:59,360<br>But there’s an order to these indices.</p>
<p>1010<br>01:00:59,360 –&gt; 01:01:04,800<br>And there has to be an element in index 0 and further up from there, right?</p>
<p>1011<br>01:01:04,800 –&gt; 01:01:09,039<br>Dictionaries also have these quote unquote indices, which we call keys.</p>
<p>1012<br>01:01:09,039 –&gt; 01:01:10,039<br>But these are custom.</p>
<p>1013<br>01:01:10,039 –&gt; 01:01:16,000<br>So you can basically rearrange, you could think of it as being allowed to rearrange</p>
<p>1014<br>01:01:16,000 –&gt; 01:01:17,680<br>indices, however you’d like, right?</p>
<p>1015<br>01:01:17,680 –&gt; 01:01:22,640<br>There’s no order to the indices in a dictionary.</p>
<p>1016<br>01:01:22,640 –&gt; 01:01:25,480<br>There are some restrictions on the keys or these indices.</p>
<p>1017<br>01:01:25,480 –&gt; 01:01:29,200<br>So they can’t be immutable, okay, hashable.</p>
<p>1018<br>01:01:29,199 –&gt; 01:01:35,480<br>But other than that, the things that you store related to that key can be any type,</p>
<p>1019<br>01:01:35,480 –&gt; 01:01:38,919<br>just like you can store any type in a list.</p>
<p>1020<br>01:01:40,079 –&gt; 01:01:44,079<br>So the last thing I’d like to go through is a larger example.</p>
<p>1021<br>01:01:44,079 –&gt; 01:01:47,599<br>And this was showcased a whole bunch of things that we’ve been talking about so</p>
<p>1022<br>01:01:47,599 –&gt; 01:01:47,919<br>far.</p>
<p>1023<br>01:01:47,919 –&gt; 01:01:51,960<br>It was showcased sort of how to, first of all,</p>
<p>1024<br>01:01:51,960 –&gt; 01:01:54,279<br>create dictionaries, which is what we did today.</p>
<p>1025<br>01:01:54,279 –&gt; 01:01:57,960<br>It was showcased how to reuse functions, how to write functions and</p>
<p>1026<br>01:01:57,960 –&gt; 01:02:00,199<br>reuse functions in other places.</p>
<p>1027<br>01:02:00,199 –&gt; 01:02:02,720<br>It was showcased a little bit of mutability as well.</p>
<p>1028<br>01:02:04,159 –&gt; 01:02:06,679<br>But this is all in a larger example.</p>
<p>1029<br>01:02:06,679 –&gt; 01:02:12,000<br>And if I go a little bit faster this, I’ve given you Python Tutor links and</p>
<p>1030<br>01:02:12,000 –&gt; 01:02:16,000<br>it’s also in the file to run on your own.</p>
<p>1031<br>01:02:16,000 –&gt; 01:02:24,920<br>So the goal of this last example is to basically find the most common words in a song’s lyrics.</p>
<p>1032<br>01:02:24,920 –&gt; 01:02:28,880<br>And dictionaries are going to be really useful for doing something like this.</p>
<p>1033<br>01:02:28,880 –&gt; 01:02:31,599<br>So I’m going to show you, first of all, what we want to end up with.</p>
<p>1034<br>01:02:31,599 –&gt; 01:02:36,119<br>And then we can talk about how to divide this larger problem into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>1035<br>01:02:38,240 –&gt; 01:02:41,760<br>So, okay, so those are all the pieces.</p>
<p>1036<br>01:02:41,760 –&gt; 01:02:49,000<br>But basically what I want to end up with is I want to have a song be stored as a string.</p>
<p>1037<br>01:02:49,880 –&gt; 01:02:50,880<br>Okay?</p>
<p>1038<br>01:02:50,880 –&gt; 01:02:53,960<br>You’ll recognize these, but these are very old.</p>
<p>1039<br>01:02:53,960 –&gt; 01:02:56,280<br>I actually haven’t updated these songs for a few years.</p>
<p>1040<br>01:02:56,280 –&gt; 01:02:58,199<br>But yeah, anyway, don’t judge.</p>
<p>1041<br>01:02:58,199 –&gt; 01:03:00,760<br>So I’ve got a song stored as a string.</p>
<p>1042<br>01:03:02,360 –&gt; 01:03:05,000<br>And I’m going to run each individual function.</p>
<p>1043<br>01:03:05,000 –&gt; 01:03:10,760<br>But in the end, what I’d like to do is come up with something like this.</p>
<p>1044<br>01:03:10,760 –&gt; 01:03:16,239<br>So I want to present the user the top most common words in the song.</p>
<p>1045<br>01:03:17,239 –&gt; 01:03:18,599<br>So here I have a list.</p>
<p>1046<br>01:03:18,599 –&gt; 01:03:21,279<br>So you can see OpenCloseCirc bracket tells me it’s a list.</p>
<p>1047<br>01:03:21,279 –&gt; 01:03:23,039<br>And I’ve got elements in my list.</p>
<p>1048<br>01:03:23,039 –&gt; 01:03:29,679<br>So here’s the first element in my list, which tells the user that the word I occurs 18 times.</p>
<p>1049<br>01:03:30,839 –&gt; 01:03:36,039<br>The next element in my list tells the user that the word we occurs 17 times.</p>
<p>1050<br>01:03:36,039 –&gt; 01:03:42,319<br>The next element tells the user that the words ain’t ever getting older occur all 16 times.</p>
<p>1051<br>01:03:42,319 –&gt; 01:03:43,399<br>And then so on, right?</p>
<p>1052<br>01:03:43,400 –&gt; 01:03:48,400<br>So we’re decreasing in frequency with the most common word occurring 18 times.</p>
<p>1053<br>01:03:48,400 –&gt; 01:03:56,519<br>And then I’m showing the user the most common words down to and including six.</p>
<p>1054<br>01:03:56,519 –&gt; 01:03:58,519<br>So I would choose some arbitrary value.</p>
<p>1055<br>01:03:58,519 –&gt; 01:04:02,400<br>I want to find in the song the words that occur at least six times, for example.</p>
<p>1056<br>01:04:03,680 –&gt; 01:04:05,440<br>So that’s the goal of this program.</p>
<p>1057<br>01:04:07,960 –&gt; 01:04:09,200<br>So how will you achieve this?</p>
<p>1058<br>01:04:09,200 –&gt; 01:04:11,400<br>It’s obviously a pretty big task.</p>
<p>1059<br>01:04:11,400 –&gt; 01:04:16,400<br>I wouldn’t want to code the entire thing right off the bat.</p>
<p>1060<br>01:04:16,400 –&gt; 01:04:19,920<br>But we can actually divide it into three smaller pieces.</p>
<p>1061<br>01:04:21,000 –&gt; 01:04:26,519<br>The first piece, and we’re going to write the code for this, is to create something called a frequency dictionary.</p>
<p>1062<br>01:04:26,519 –&gt; 01:04:34,000<br>So given a string of words, we’re going to create a dictionary that maps each word to how often it occurs.</p>
<p>1063<br>01:04:34,000 –&gt; 01:04:37,559<br>So fancy word, frequency dictionary, but it’s pretty simple.</p>
<p>1064<br>01:04:37,559 –&gt; 01:04:41,320<br>It just maps the word to its count inside my long string.</p>
<p>1065<br>01:04:42,840 –&gt; 01:04:48,440<br>So this presents the data, which is this string of words in a much nicer format, right?</p>
<p>1066<br>01:04:48,440 –&gt; 01:04:51,639<br>It’s a dictionary that tells me the frequency of each word.</p>
<p>1067<br>01:04:53,039 –&gt; 01:04:56,079<br>Once I have that in hand, things get a little bit easier.</p>
<p>1068<br>01:04:56,079 –&gt; 01:05:01,519<br>I can write another function that finds the word that occurs most often in that dictionary.</p>
<p>1069<br>01:05:02,519 –&gt; 01:05:07,000<br>So the way I’m going to do that is look up the frequencies in the values.</p>
<p>1070<br>01:05:07,000 –&gt; 01:05:13,119<br>Find the maximum of those values, and then figure out which keys are associated with that maximum value.</p>
<p>1071<br>01:05:15,159 –&gt; 01:05:19,880<br>And this is all made possible because I’ve reimagined my data in this frequency dictionary format.</p>
<p>1072<br>01:05:21,119 –&gt; 01:05:26,920<br>The last step, once I figure out how to write a function that returns for me,</p>
<p>1073<br>01:05:26,920 –&gt; 01:05:32,800<br>the words that occurred the most times, is to find the words that occur at least some number of times.</p>
<p>1074<br>01:05:33,800 –&gt; 01:05:38,720<br>And I’ll go through an example of this one in a few slides when we get to it.</p>
<p>1075<br>01:05:38,720 –&gt; 01:05:43,880<br>But this last function here, number three, you can actually rewrite it in a whole bunch of ways.</p>
<p>1076<br>01:05:43,880 –&gt; 01:05:45,560<br>I’m just going to show you one way to write it.</p>
<p>1077<br>01:05:45,560 –&gt; 01:05:50,440<br>That’ll involve mutability, but you don’t have to do it using mutability.</p>
<p>1078<br>01:05:50,440 –&gt; 01:05:55,080<br>You can definitely do it in a whole bunch of, you know, with a whole bunch of other implementations.</p>
<p>1079<br>01:05:56,079 –&gt; 01:06:03,079<br>So let’s begin by first creating a dictionary that maps the word to their frequencies.</p>
<p>1080<br>01:06:03,079 –&gt; 01:06:13,079<br>So I’ve picked a song that it has a real song, and it has some repetition, and it’s short that it fits in one line.</p>
<p>1081<br>01:06:13,079 –&gt; 01:06:19,079<br>So I’ve got this song here, and I’ve got my function generate word dictionary.</p>
<p>1082<br>01:06:19,079 –&gt; 01:06:22,079<br>The song is a string.</p>
<p>1083<br>01:06:22,079 –&gt; 01:06:29,079<br>So it’s basically the song a little bit cleaned up, not in terms of words, but in terms of removing punctuation,</p>
<p>1084<br>01:06:29,079 –&gt; 01:06:36,079<br>removing commas, maybe extramations, or I might have kept quotations or something like that.</p>
<p>1085<br>01:06:36,079 –&gt; 01:06:43,079<br>But basically it’s removing all of the punctuation stuff, because that will mess up my word counts.</p>
<p>1086<br>01:06:43,079 –&gt; 01:06:47,079<br>So what is this function going to do, given a string for my song?</p>
<p>1087<br>01:06:47,079 –&gt; 01:06:51,079<br>Well first, I’m going to convert all my letters to lowercase.</p>
<p>1088<br>01:06:51,079 –&gt; 01:07:00,079<br>This means that, you know, capital THG will be counted as the same word as lowercase THG, which is the correct way to do it.</p>
<p>1089<br>01:07:00,079 –&gt; 01:07:03,079<br>So convert everything to lowercase.</p>
<p>1090<br>01:07:03,079 –&gt; 01:07:10,079<br>Then I’m going to use our friend, the split function, remember, which takes in my string and splits on a character.</p>
<p>1091<br>01:07:10,079 –&gt; 01:07:13,079<br>So by default it’ll split on the space.</p>
<p>1092<br>01:07:13,079 –&gt; 01:07:22,079<br>This puts our string of words in a very manageable format, a list of words.</p>
<p>1093<br>01:07:22,079 –&gt; 01:07:26,079<br>Much nicer to work with lists than work with a string.</p>
<p>1094<br>01:07:26,079 –&gt; 01:07:32,079<br>Now that I have my word list, I’m going to create my empty dictionary and then populate it.</p>
<p>1095<br>01:07:32,079 –&gt; 01:07:38,079<br>So I’m iterating over my list of words, and then I have a choice.</p>
<p>1096<br>01:07:38,079 –&gt; 01:07:42,079<br>I’ve seen this word already, and I want to update the frequency.</p>
<p>1097<br>01:07:42,079 –&gt; 01:07:48,079<br>So I want to increase the frequency by one, because I’ve already added this word to my dictionary.</p>
<p>1098<br>01:07:48,079 –&gt; 01:07:54,079<br>Or this is the first time I’m seeing this word, and I want to add it to my dictionary with a frequency of one.</p>
<p>1099<br>01:07:54,079 –&gt; 01:08:00,079<br>So the first case here would be if we’ll update the frequency, because I’ve already seen the word in my dictionary.</p>
<p>1100<br>01:08:00,079 –&gt; 01:08:05,079<br>So here, I’m using the in-key word to check if the key, the word, is already in my dictionary.</p>
<p>1101<br>01:08:05,079 –&gt; 01:08:08,079<br>If so, I increase its frequency by one.</p>
<p>1102<br>01:08:08,079 –&gt; 01:08:15,079<br>Otherwise, this is the first time I’m adding my word to my dictionary, so give it a frequency of one.</p>
<p>1103<br>01:08:15,079 –&gt; 01:08:17,079<br>And then I return the word dictionary.</p>
<p>1104<br>01:08:17,079 –&gt; 01:08:22,079<br>So this will map strings to integers.</p>
<p>1105<br>01:08:22,079 –&gt; 01:08:29,079<br>Let’s work through it in the Python tutor.</p>
<p>1106<br>01:08:30,079 –&gt; 01:08:34,079<br>So step, step, step, step, step.</p>
<p>1107<br>01:08:34,079 –&gt; 01:08:37,079<br>Lowercase my input string, step.</p>
<p>1108<br>01:08:37,079 –&gt; 01:08:38,079<br>I’ve split it.</p>
<p>1109<br>01:08:38,079 –&gt; 01:08:42,079<br>So now I’ve got this list of all of my words.</p>
<p>1110<br>01:08:42,079 –&gt; 01:08:44,079<br>Step.</p>
<p>1111<br>01:08:44,079 –&gt; 01:08:45,079<br>This is where we begin.</p>
<p>1112<br>01:08:45,079 –&gt; 01:08:47,079<br>So I’ve created my empty dictionary over here.</p>
<p>1113<br>01:08:47,079 –&gt; 01:08:50,079<br>This is, keep an eye on this area here.</p>
<p>1114<br>01:08:50,079 –&gt; 01:08:52,079<br>It will be come populated soon.</p>
<p>1115<br>01:08:52,079 –&gt; 01:08:55,079<br>The first word, W, is raw.</p>
<p>1116<br>01:08:55,079 –&gt; 01:08:57,079<br>Right? It’s the first word in my list.</p>
<p>1117<br>01:08:57,079 –&gt; 01:09:00,079<br>It’s obviously the first time I’m seeing it.</p>
<p>1118<br>01:09:00,079 –&gt; 01:09:04,079<br>I have nothing in my dictionary right now, so I’m going to pop in my else.</p>
<p>1119<br>01:09:04,079 –&gt; 01:09:08,079<br>And I’m going to add it to my dictionary with a frequency of one.</p>
<p>1120<br>01:09:08,079 –&gt; 01:09:10,079<br>Okay, that worked.</p>
<p>1121<br>01:09:10,079 –&gt; 01:09:15,079<br>Next, word in my dictionary is this, in my list is this one.</p>
<p>1122<br>01:09:15,079 –&gt; 01:09:17,079<br>Same word, I’ve already seen.</p>
<p>1123<br>01:09:17,079 –&gt; 01:09:21,079<br>So I’m going to go inside the if and increase the frequency to two.</p>
<p>1124<br>01:09:21,079 –&gt; 01:09:22,079<br>Right?</p>
<p>1125<br>01:09:22,079 –&gt; 01:09:23,079<br>Raw is now two.</p>
<p>1126<br>01:09:23,079 –&gt; 01:09:26,079<br>Next is ah.</p>
<p>1127<br>01:09:26,079 –&gt; 01:09:28,079<br>Right? So here’s my word.</p>
<p>1128<br>01:09:28,079 –&gt; 01:09:29,079<br>I’ve got the next one.</p>
<p>1129<br>01:09:29,079 –&gt; 01:09:31,079<br>In my list, it’s the first time I’m seeing it.</p>
<p>1130<br>01:09:31,079 –&gt; 01:09:34,079<br>Add it to my dictionary with a frequency of one.</p>
<p>1131<br>01:09:34,079 –&gt; 01:09:39,079<br>Next word I’m seeing is, again, increase its frequency to two.</p>
<p>1132<br>01:09:39,079 –&gt; 01:09:41,079<br>And I’m going to go faster now.</p>
<p>1133<br>01:09:41,079 –&gt; 01:09:43,079<br>This is increasing the frequency to three.</p>
<p>1134<br>01:09:43,079 –&gt; 01:09:44,079<br>Right?</p>
<p>1135<br>01:09:44,079 –&gt; 01:09:45,079<br>Because I’ve seen it three times now.</p>
<p>1136<br>01:09:45,079 –&gt; 01:09:49,079<br>And then I’m adding Rome for the first time.</p>
<p>1137<br>01:09:49,079 –&gt; 01:09:51,079<br>Ma for the first time.</p>
<p>1138<br>01:09:51,079 –&gt; 01:09:55,079<br>And Rome for the first time.</p>
<p>1139<br>01:09:55,079 –&gt; 01:09:59,079<br>And lastly, I’m going to increase Ma.</p>
<p>1140<br>01:09:59,079 –&gt; 01:10:03,079<br>Frequency two more times because it occurs two more times in my song.</p>
<p>1141<br>01:10:03,079 –&gt; 01:10:04,079<br>Right?</p>
<p>1142<br>01:10:04,079 –&gt; 01:10:05,079<br>So that it’s increased to two.</p>
<p>1143<br>01:10:05,079 –&gt; 01:10:06,079<br>And now it’s increased to three.</p>
<p>1144<br>01:10:06,079 –&gt; 01:10:07,079<br>And then we’re done.</p>
<p>1145<br>01:10:07,079 –&gt; 01:10:10,079<br>So we return the word dictionary.</p>
<p>1146<br>01:10:10,079 –&gt; 01:10:14,079<br>Really nice way to represent my list, my song.</p>
<p>1147<br>01:10:14,079 –&gt; 01:10:15,079<br>Right?</p>
<p>1148<br>01:10:15,079 –&gt; 01:10:16,079<br>Very nice.</p>
<p>1149<br>01:10:17,079 –&gt; 01:10:18,079<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1150<br>01:10:18,079 –&gt; 01:10:22,079<br>So now that I have this frequency dictionary, and I’ve put it up here,</p>
<p>1151<br>01:10:22,079 –&gt; 01:10:24,079<br>this is what we ended up with.</p>
<p>1152<br>01:10:24,079 –&gt; 01:10:29,079<br>How can we write a function that returns for me the most frequent word?</p>
<p>1153<br>01:10:29,079 –&gt; 01:10:36,079<br>So one thing we can recognize is the most frequent word has the highest value,</p>
<p>1154<br>01:10:36,079 –&gt; 01:10:40,079<br>Python dictionary value, in my dictionary.</p>
<p>1155<br>01:10:40,079 –&gt; 01:10:41,079<br>Right?</p>
<p>1156<br>01:10:42,079 –&gt; 01:10:48,079<br>So as a human, I would kind of look to see which one of these entries have the biggest value.</p>
<p>1157<br>01:10:48,079 –&gt; 01:10:53,079<br>As a computer, I can’t really do that because I have to do it a little bit more systematically.</p>
<p>1158<br>01:10:53,079 –&gt; 01:10:59,079<br>So what we can say is, well, let’s look at our values and grab the maximum of the values.</p>
<p>1159<br>01:10:59,079 –&gt; 01:11:08,079<br>So here I’m using this dot values function on my dictionary to grab for me all of the values in my dictionary.</p>
<p>1160<br>01:11:08,079 –&gt; 01:11:12,079<br>So this will be kind of like the list 2, 3, 1, 3, 1.</p>
<p>1161<br>01:11:12,079 –&gt; 01:11:15,079<br>And then I’m running the max function on that list.</p>
<p>1162<br>01:11:15,079 –&gt; 01:11:20,079<br>So max of this list of numbers gives me the maximum value in that list, the three.</p>
<p>1163<br>01:11:20,079 –&gt; 01:11:24,079<br>So highest now has the value into your three.</p>
<p>1164<br>01:11:24,079 –&gt; 01:11:30,079<br>And now all I need to do is iterate over my element, entries in my dictionary.</p>
<p>1165<br>01:11:30,079 –&gt; 01:11:33,079<br>So this is KV in the items.</p>
<p>1166<br>01:11:33,079 –&gt; 01:11:39,079<br>And I’m checking now inside this iteration is if the value is equal to the highest.</p>
<p>1167<br>01:11:39,079 –&gt; 01:11:45,079<br>So as I’m looking at each entry is the value for that entry the same as the highest one I’ve seen.</p>
<p>1168<br>01:11:45,079 –&gt; 01:11:53,079<br>If it is, I’m going to maintain a list of all the words with that highest value because there might be more than one word that has that highest value.</p>
<p>1169<br>01:11:53,079 –&gt; 01:12:00,079<br>As we saw when we actually ran it here, right, here I had a list of all of these words that occurred 16 times.</p>
<p>1170<br>01:12:00,079 –&gt; 01:12:06,079<br>So that’s kind of the output that I want to maintain.</p>
<p>1171<br>01:12:06,079 –&gt; 01:12:13,079<br>So I’m appending to my words list and at the end I’m returning this tuple with the words comma that highest value.</p>
<p>1172<br>01:12:13,079 –&gt; 01:12:18,079<br>So Python tutor, like in the previous time.</p>
<p>1173<br>01:12:18,079 –&gt; 01:12:21,079<br>So let’s create our original dictionaries.</p>
<p>1174<br>01:12:21,079 –&gt; 01:12:23,079<br>This is what we ended up with last time.</p>
<p>1175<br>01:12:23,079 –&gt; 01:12:25,079<br>So the highest value is 3 here.</p>
<p>1176<br>01:12:25,079 –&gt; 01:12:31,079<br>And I’m going to look through each entry in my dictionary so you can see KV is going to be each one of these in order.</p>
<p>1177<br>01:12:31,079 –&gt; 01:12:34,079<br>So first it’s raw to then it’s a three and so on.</p>
<p>1178<br>01:12:34,079 –&gt; 01:12:36,079<br>Obviously the two is not equal to the three.</p>
<p>1179<br>01:12:36,079 –&gt; 01:12:38,079<br>So we move on.</p>
<p>1180<br>01:12:38,079 –&gt; 01:12:39,079<br>The three equals the three.</p>
<p>1181<br>01:12:39,079 –&gt; 01:12:43,079<br>So we take the a and boom, add it to my list here.</p>
<p>1182<br>01:12:43,079 –&gt; 01:12:48,079<br>So this is the list I’m maintaining of all the words that occur with that frequency three.</p>
<p>1183<br>01:12:48,079 –&gt; 01:12:51,079<br>Next, no for your own.</p>
<p>1184<br>01:12:51,079 –&gt; 01:12:52,079<br>Yes for ma.</p>
<p>1185<br>01:12:52,079 –&gt; 01:12:58,079<br>So I’m going to add it to my list and then no for row and I’m done.</p>
<p>1186<br>01:12:58,079 –&gt; 01:13:09,079<br>So the return is going to be this list, this tuple here with the list of the words that occur three times.</p>
<p>1187<br>01:13:09,079 –&gt; 01:13:12,079<br>Okay, good.</p>
<p>1188<br>01:13:12,079 –&gt; 01:13:13,079<br>Last part.</p>
<p>1189<br>01:13:13,079 –&gt; 01:13:15,079<br>I’m not going to go through Python tutor.</p>
<p>1190<br>01:13:15,079 –&gt; 01:13:18,079<br>I did include a link to it because it becomes very messy with the arrows.</p>
<p>1191<br>01:13:18,079 –&gt; 01:13:22,079<br>So I’m going to put it to the list and I’m going to go through it.</p>
<p>1192<br>01:13:22,079 –&gt; 01:13:25,079<br>I’m going to take it to the list and I’m going to tell you what I do encourage you to try it.</p>
<p>1193<br>01:13:25,079 –&gt; 01:13:28,079<br>I will explain the way that I chose to solve this problem.</p>
<p>1194<br>01:13:28,079 –&gt; 01:13:37,079<br>So I chose to solve this problem to include mutation and reusing the function that we just wrote that grabs for me the highest value.</p>
<p>1195<br>01:13:37,079 –&gt; 01:13:42,079<br>And the words associated with that highest frequency value.</p>
<p>1196<br>01:13:42,079 –&gt; 01:13:44,079<br>So this is the idea.</p>
<p>1197<br>01:13:44,079 –&gt; 01:13:47,079<br>I have my original word dictionary.</p>
<p>1198<br>01:13:47,079 –&gt; 01:13:51,079<br>This is the frequency dictionary we created right off the bat.</p>
<p>1199<br>01:13:51,079 –&gt; 01:13:58,079<br>What I’m going to do is look to see which words occur with the highest frequency.</p>
<p>1200<br>01:13:58,079 –&gt; 01:14:01,079<br>So the highest frequency, my function from before,</p>
<p>1201<br>01:14:01,079 –&gt; 01:14:04,079<br>it figures out that it’s three,</p>
<p>1202<br>01:14:04,079 –&gt; 01:14:10,079<br>and it figures out the words associated with that three are a and ma.</p>
<p>1203<br>01:14:10,079 –&gt; 01:14:13,079<br>That’s exactly what we just did.</p>
<p>1204<br>01:14:13,079 –&gt; 01:14:17,079<br>So I’m going to grab those words and those entries in the dictionary.</p>
<p>1205<br>01:14:17,079 –&gt; 01:14:21,079<br>And then I’m going to mutate the dictionary to remove those words,</p>
<p>1206<br>01:14:21,079 –&gt; 01:14:26,079<br>because I know those words occur with the highest frequency.</p>
<p>1207<br>01:14:26,079 –&gt; 01:14:29,079<br>So now I’ve removed those words,</p>
<p>1208<br>01:14:29,079 –&gt; 01:14:33,079<br>and I’ve saved them because they were the result of the function that I had just run.</p>
<p>1209<br>01:14:33,079 –&gt; 01:14:36,079<br>So I’m maintaining this frequency list,</p>
<p>1210<br>01:14:36,079 –&gt; 01:14:39,079<br>which will contain all the words that occur at least,</p>
<p>1211<br>01:14:39,079 –&gt; 01:14:45,079<br>I guess I said greater than one time, so at least two times.</p>
<p>1212<br>01:14:45,079 –&gt; 01:14:48,079<br>So I’m going to grab the ones that occur three in two times.</p>
<p>1213<br>01:14:48,079 –&gt; 01:14:52,079<br>So right now I had just grabbed the words that occur three times.</p>
<p>1214<br>01:14:52,079 –&gt; 01:14:55,079<br>I’ve removed them from my dictionary.</p>
<p>1215<br>01:14:55,079 –&gt; 01:14:58,079<br>So I’ve actually mutated my dictionary to remove those words.</p>
<p>1216<br>01:14:58,079 –&gt; 01:15:04,079<br>Now, if I run the exact same function that I just wrote on the previous slide,</p>
<p>1217<br>01:15:04,079 –&gt; 01:15:09,079<br>on this mutated dictionary, which words will it give me?</p>
<p>1218<br>01:15:09,079 –&gt; 01:15:13,079<br>Which words occur the most now?</p>
<p>1219<br>01:15:13,079 –&gt; 01:15:15,079<br>Exactly, right?</p>
<p>1220<br>01:15:15,079 –&gt; 01:15:19,079<br>Now the highest value in my dictionary and this frequency dictionary is two,</p>
<p>1221<br>01:15:19,079 –&gt; 01:15:22,079<br>because I mutated to remove what was previously the highest value.</p>
<p>1222<br>01:15:22,079 –&gt; 01:15:28,079<br>So I’m running the same function again on the mutated dictionary to give me just the raw.</p>
<p>1223<br>01:15:29,079 –&gt; 01:15:33,079<br>So I grab that, keep track of that in my frequency list,</p>
<p>1224<br>01:15:33,079 –&gt; 01:15:35,079<br>right?</p>
<p>1225<br>01:15:35,079 –&gt; 01:15:38,079<br>Mutate the dictionary to remove that.</p>
<p>1226<br>01:15:38,079 –&gt; 01:15:44,079<br>And as I’m doing that, I’m also keeping track to make sure that the highest frequency I have in the remaining dictionary</p>
<p>1227<br>01:15:44,079 –&gt; 01:15:47,079<br>is at least whatever I was interested in.</p>
<p>1228<br>01:15:47,079 –&gt; 01:15:49,079<br>So here I want it at least two.</p>
<p>1229<br>01:15:49,079 –&gt; 01:15:54,079<br>So this function, the one I’ll write, will no longer grab any other values from the dictionary,</p>
<p>1230<br>01:15:54,079 –&gt; 01:15:57,079<br>because now one frequency one, I don’t want to grab.</p>
<p>1231<br>01:15:58,079 –&gt; 01:16:01,079<br>So this is the resulting value.</p>
<p>1232<br>01:16:01,079 –&gt; 01:16:02,079<br>And that’s the idea.</p>
<p>1233<br>01:16:02,079 –&gt; 01:16:05,079<br>We’re using mutability and the function we just wrote to do this task.</p>
<p>1234<br>01:16:05,079 –&gt; 01:16:07,079<br>And this is the code that does that.</p>
<p>1235<br>01:16:07,079 –&gt; 01:16:11,079<br>So this runs the function we wrote previously, step number two,</p>
<p>1236<br>01:16:11,079 –&gt; 01:16:15,079<br>gives us that list, that tuple with the list of all the words.</p>
<p>1237<br>01:16:15,079 –&gt; 01:16:21,079<br>This loop here, make sure I still have frequencies that are at least x in the dictionary.</p>
<p>1238<br>01:16:22,079 –&gt; 01:16:26,079<br>I grab the tuple that I just created, so something like this,</p>
<p>1239<br>01:16:26,079 –&gt; 01:16:28,079<br>and add it to my frequency list.</p>
<p>1240<br>01:16:28,079 –&gt; 01:16:31,079<br>So this is the resulting list that I’m keeping track of.</p>
<p>1241<br>01:16:31,079 –&gt; 01:16:34,079<br>And then this bit here removes the word for my dictionary.</p>
<p>1242<br>01:16:34,079 –&gt; 01:16:37,079<br>So I’m mutating the dictionary using this del keyword that we saw,</p>
<p>1243<br>01:16:37,079 –&gt; 01:16:39,079<br>at the beginning of this lecture.</p>
<p>1244<br>01:16:39,079 –&gt; 01:16:41,079<br>Yeah, question.</p>
<p>1245<br>01:16:42,079 –&gt; 01:16:43,079<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1246<br>01:16:43,079 –&gt; 01:16:51,079<br>I guess what I just did is, why is the word, well, the nonsense, the matter.</p>
<p>1247<br>01:17:01,079 –&gt; 01:17:05,079<br>So I think maybe it’s because the function, I forget what the specification said,</p>
<p>1248<br>01:17:05,079 –&gt; 01:17:09,079<br>but I don’t know if it said at least two, or greater than two.</p>
<p>1249<br>01:17:10,079 –&gt; 01:17:12,079<br>Or greater, at least x or greater than x.</p>
<p>1250<br>01:17:12,079 –&gt; 01:17:15,079<br>It depends on which one I actually said in the specification.</p>
<p>1251<br>01:17:15,079 –&gt; 01:17:19,079<br>But you can imagine changing this to greater than or greater than or equal to.</p>
<p>1252<br>01:17:19,079 –&gt; 01:17:24,079<br>And then we’re running this function again inside this y-loop to grab the frequency value.</p>
<p>1253<br>01:17:24,079 –&gt; 01:17:26,079<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1254<br>01:17:26,079 –&gt; 01:17:29,079<br>So these are just the observations I actually stated at the beginning of this example.</p>
<p>1255<br>01:17:29,079 –&gt; 01:17:34,079<br>A bunch of the different things that we’ve learned that we’re using within this example.</p>
<p>1256<br>01:17:34,079 –&gt; 01:17:39,079<br>So slicing, or splitting, iterating over the list directly,</p>
<p>1257<br>01:17:39,079 –&gt; 01:17:44,079<br>mutability, using the items, things like that.</p>
<p>1258<br>01:17:44,079 –&gt; 01:17:45,079<br>So that’s it.</p>
<p>1259<br>01:17:45,079 –&gt; 01:17:47,079<br>That’s all I have.</p>
<p>1260<br>01:17:47,079 –&gt; 01:17:48,079<br>I’ll see you guys on Monday.</p>
<p>1261<br>01:17:48,079 –&gt; 01:17:50,079<br>Monday is Halloween.</p>
<p>1262<br>01:17:50,079 –&gt; 01:17:54,079<br>If you’d like to bring a costume, I love Halloween.</p>
<p>1263<br>01:17:54,079 –&gt; 01:17:58,079<br>I will wear something different than what I usually wear.</p>
<p>1264<br>01:18:04,079 –&gt; 01:18:06,079<br>You</p>
