                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:17,300<br>All right.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:17,300 –&gt; 00:00:21,219<br>So let’s get started on today’s lecture.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:21,219 –&gt; 00:00:26,500<br>So today we’re going to be doing one of two lectures on the topic of recursion.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:26,500 –&gt; 00:00:28,899<br>And you may or may not have heard of recursion.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:28,899 –&gt; 00:00:36,100<br>It’s a programming technique and a way to algorithmically solve problems.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:36,100 –&gt; 00:00:43,179<br>It’s not something that’s going to come easy because it’s going to force our brain to think</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:43,179 –&gt; 00:00:48,420<br>about problems that we’ve seen in a completely different way.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:48,420 –&gt; 00:00:53,659<br>So you don’t have to use recursion if you don’t want to, but there will be problems where</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:53,659 –&gt; 00:00:59,619<br>the idea of recursion and applying or writing recursive code is going to come a lot more</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:59,619 –&gt; 00:01:04,259<br>naturally than writing code that we have been so far.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:04,259 –&gt; 00:01:07,819<br>But I’m just warning you, it’s going to take a little bit of kind of forgetting everything</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:07,819 –&gt; 00:01:13,159<br>we’ve learned about loops and things like that to train our brain to think recursively</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:13,159 –&gt; 00:01:15,340<br>for the next two lectures.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:15,340 –&gt; 00:01:19,340<br>To help you, we will have an interactive portion of today’s lecture.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:19,340 –&gt; 00:01:24,780<br>So think about whether you want to come up on stage or whatever this is the front and</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:24,780 –&gt; 00:01:27,980<br>be a part of the interaction.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:27,980 –&gt; 00:01:34,820<br>You’ll be forever immortalized in the open course where, awesome, I love it, on the open</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:34,820 –&gt; 00:01:38,780<br>course where it videos.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:38,780 –&gt; 00:01:41,020<br>All right.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:41,020 –&gt; 00:01:47,180<br>So let’s think about iterative algorithms that we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:47,180 –&gt; 00:01:52,100<br>So iterative algorithm basically means we are writing code that has a loop within it,</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:52,100 –&gt; 00:01:53,100<br>right?</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:53,100 –&gt; 00:01:57,100<br>So either a for loop or a while loop, writing code with these for loops or while loops</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:57,100 –&gt; 00:01:58,780<br>lead to iterative algorithms.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:58,780 –&gt; 00:02:05,620<br>So things that do some task, some for some repetition.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:05,620 –&gt; 00:02:11,980<br>So the idea of iterative algorithm is that there are some variables that capture the state</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:11,980 –&gt; 00:02:13,379<br>of the computation.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:13,379 –&gt; 00:02:18,819<br>So each time through the loop, these variables will change their value, essentially capturing</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:18,819 –&gt; 00:02:22,099<br>what the values are at each step in the loop.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:22,099 –&gt; 00:02:26,579<br>So when we’re writing these iterative algorithms, we basically think about what is something</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:26,579 –&gt; 00:02:30,539<br>that’s changing each time through the loop, like we keep running some, like that’s the</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:30,539 –&gt; 00:02:32,859<br>easiest example, right?</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:32,859 –&gt; 00:02:38,259<br>What is a variable that’s changing each time through the loop, kind of like a counter that</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:38,259 –&gt; 00:02:41,780<br>keeps track of how many times we’ve been through a loop?</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:41,780 –&gt; 00:02:42,780<br>And do you stop?</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:42,780 –&gt; 00:02:47,780<br>So for for loops, you stop after you’ve exhausted a sequence for while loops, you stopped when</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:47,780 –&gt; 00:02:50,180<br>you have a condition that becomes false.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:50,180 –&gt; 00:02:54,420<br>And then at the end of the loop, you have some sort of result that you’ve been storing</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:54,420 –&gt; 00:02:57,939<br>and accumulating or changing each time through the loop.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:57,939 –&gt; 00:03:02,500<br>So that’s an iterative algorithm and we’ve been working with these a lot.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:02,500 –&gt; 00:03:08,780<br>So to show you, we’re going to go through the next few slides showing you an iterative algorithm</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:08,780 –&gt; 00:03:10,099<br>to do multiplication.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:10,099 –&gt; 00:03:16,859<br>It’s going to be very, very simple, but we’re also then after going to look at the same</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:16,859 –&gt; 00:03:21,620<br>problem, which is doing multiplication, but in the context of recursion.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:21,620 –&gt; 00:03:26,019<br>And hopefully that gives you a sense for how we think about the exact same problem we’re</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:26,019 –&gt; 00:03:31,659<br>trying to solve, multiplying two numbers together in a completely different way.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:31,659 –&gt; 00:03:34,379<br>So this is not the function that I want to write with iteration.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:34,379 –&gt; 00:03:39,539<br>I don’t want to create a function named molt and then return a star B, right?</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:39,539 –&gt; 00:03:41,579<br>I don’t want to use the built-in function.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:41,579 –&gt; 00:03:46,780<br>I want to assume that I don’t know how to do a star, a multiplication.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:46,780 –&gt; 00:03:51,500<br>And so instead, what I’m going to do is I’m going to rely on, let’s say I know how to</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:51,500 –&gt; 00:03:52,899<br>do addition.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:52,899 –&gt; 00:03:59,659<br>I’m going to rely on the idea of addition to actually write my multiplication function.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:59,659 –&gt; 00:04:03,659<br>So let’s think about how to make multiplication iterative.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:03,659 –&gt; 00:04:05,780<br>We can have a loop, right?</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:05,780 –&gt; 00:04:10,500<br>That adds a to itself b times, right?</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:10,500 –&gt; 00:04:13,500<br>That is the definition of multiplication.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:13,500 –&gt; 00:04:16,860<br>So let’s write a function that does this using a for loop.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:16,860 –&gt; 00:04:19,540<br>Then we’ll write it using a while loop.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:19,540 –&gt; 00:04:23,420<br>With a for loop, we’re going to write this iterative algorithm.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:23,420 –&gt; 00:04:27,740<br>It’s capturing the state of the computation, just like we said we should.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:27,740 –&gt; 00:04:33,540<br>So the for loop will iterate, will have my sort of range of values being from zero</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:33,540 –&gt; 00:04:37,460<br>to B. So we’re going to repeat this loop b times.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:37,460 –&gt; 00:04:41,980<br>The variable total is capturing my state of the computation, right?</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:41,980 –&gt; 00:04:46,500<br>It’s keeping track of what the total is at each step through my loop.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:46,500 –&gt; 00:04:50,100<br>At the end of the loop, I return the total.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:50,100 –&gt; 00:04:54,259<br>So very, very simple iterative function here.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:54,259 –&gt; 00:04:56,340<br>Now let’s think about another iterative solution.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:56,340 –&gt; 00:05:03,500<br>Instead of keeping a loop variable b that goes from zero all the way up to b, or</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:03,500 –&gt; 00:05:04,500<br>what was my loop variable?</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:04,500 –&gt; 00:05:08,139<br>And I think, yeah, instead of keeping a loop variable and that goes from zero to b,</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:08,139 –&gt; 00:05:09,620<br>let’s work our way backward.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:09,620 –&gt; 00:05:12,180<br>And this time let’s use a while loop just for fun.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:12,180 –&gt; 00:05:16,980<br>Let’s say that I’m going to start at b and count down to zero.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:16,980 –&gt; 00:05:22,620<br>So again, repeating some task b times.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:22,620 –&gt; 00:05:27,459<br>So what I’m going to do is I’m going to have some counter that starts at b and</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:27,459 –&gt; 00:05:30,019<br>decreases down to zero.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:30,019 –&gt; 00:05:32,939<br>Again, within my loop, I have to keep track of</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:32,939 –&gt; 00:05:33,939<br>the result.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:33,939 –&gt; 00:05:38,579<br>So my total in the previous code is now being called result in this code.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:38,579 –&gt; 00:05:42,939<br>And so what I’m going to do is my iteration will start right at zero and</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:42,939 –&gt; 00:05:47,259<br>then I’m going to keep adding a to itself b times.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:47,259 –&gt; 00:05:49,980<br>So the code looks like this.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:49,980 –&gt; 00:05:52,939<br>I’ve got my while loop this time instead of a for loop.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:52,939 –&gt; 00:05:59,819<br>I’m going to start out with knowing what b is and I’m going to decrease b by one each time through the loop.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:59,819 –&gt; 00:06:02,899<br>So here I’ve got b equals b minus 1.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:02,899 –&gt; 00:06:06,699<br>So that’s capturing the state of the counter at each iteration.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:06,699 –&gt; 00:06:11,740<br>The result just like the total in the previous slide is capturing the state of my sum at</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:11,740 –&gt; 00:06:13,540<br>each time through the iteration.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:13,540 –&gt; 00:06:15,659<br>And at the end, I return result.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:15,659 –&gt; 00:06:21,779<br>So hopefully, very simple, very review code here.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:21,779 –&gt; 00:06:27,060<br>But now let’s look at the code in a recursive sense.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:27,060 –&gt; 00:06:29,659<br>So here, let’s not look at the code yet.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:29,660 –&gt; 00:06:36,060<br>But let’s think about, is there some thing that we’re repeating over and over and over again?</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:36,060 –&gt; 00:06:40,140<br>If we recognize it, we can think recursively.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:40,140 –&gt; 00:06:43,780<br>So let’s try to figure out this recursive pattern.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:43,780 –&gt; 00:06:47,500<br>So I work best with example, like actual numbers.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:47,500 –&gt; 00:06:54,740<br>So instead of using an abstract a and b, let’s use a as five and b as four as an example.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:54,740 –&gt; 00:06:59,819<br>So let’s say I want to use the star operator, that’s basically the function I’m trying to implement,</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:59,819 –&gt; 00:07:03,860<br>the star operator between five and four.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:03,860 –&gt; 00:07:10,220<br>So in the iterative sense, we said that’s five plus five plus five plus five, adding five four times.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:10,220 –&gt; 00:07:15,500<br>The idea of recursion is that we’re trying to take our original problem, which is using</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:15,500 –&gt; 00:07:23,819<br>the star operator between two numbers and try to solve a very similar problem, if not the</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:23,819 –&gt; 00:07:28,139<br>same, but in a slightly changed way.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:28,139 –&gt; 00:07:36,379<br>So instead of saying I’m going to multiply five by four, what I will do is recognize that five times four,</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:36,379 –&gt; 00:07:44,300<br>which is my original problem, can be rewritten by extracting out one of my fives.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:44,300 –&gt; 00:07:51,180<br>So I’m going to take a five out and add it to five times three.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:51,180 –&gt; 00:07:53,459<br>So this is my recursive pattern.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:53,459 –&gt; 00:08:00,019<br>I’m using the star operator between five and some number, but if I extract a five out,</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:00,019 –&gt; 00:08:09,740<br>I can use the star operator between five and a slightly smaller number, one less than four.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:09,740 –&gt; 00:08:13,099<br>Well, what if I do the, what about five times three?</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:13,099 –&gt; 00:08:16,019<br>Can I do the same thing again?</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:16,019 –&gt; 00:08:17,219<br>I can, right?</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:17,219 –&gt; 00:08:21,740<br>For five times three, I can again notice that I can extract the five out again,</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:21,740 –&gt; 00:08:25,420<br>and I have five plus five times two.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:25,420 –&gt; 00:08:31,379<br>And then I can do the same thing again to figure out what five times two is, I can again extract a five out</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:31,379 –&gt; 00:08:36,220<br>and be left with five times one or five star one, right?</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:36,220 –&gt; 00:08:41,299<br>And so notice the thing inside the box is, is basically me solving my original problem,</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:41,299 –&gt; 00:08:48,779<br>which is using the star operator between five and some number, but that number is changing each time,</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:48,779 –&gt; 00:08:51,139<br>you know, on each line.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:51,139 –&gt; 00:08:55,460<br>At some point, I can say this problem is so easy that I know the answer.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:55,460 –&gt; 00:09:00,699<br>So five star one, so a number multiplied with one, is just the number itself.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:00,699 –&gt; 00:09:06,899<br>And so at that point, I can say I don’t need to continue dividing my problem into smaller and smaller pieces.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:06,899 –&gt; 00:09:13,100<br>So just to bring the point home, let’s use parentheses to illustrate sort of which pieces I’m replacing where.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:13,100 –&gt; 00:09:17,620<br>So I’ve got my original problem, five, applying the star operator,</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:17,620 –&gt; 00:09:20,220<br>the multiplication on five and four.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:20,220 –&gt; 00:09:27,820<br>I extract the five out, and I recognize that I can have five plus and solving five star three.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:27,820 –&gt; 00:09:32,779<br>I need to have some trust here, right?</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:32,779 –&gt; 00:09:38,299<br>I don’t know what five star three is, but if I decompose that problem in the exact same way,</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:38,299 –&gt; 00:09:43,460<br>I can extract the five out of that, right?</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:43,460 –&gt; 00:09:46,500<br>And add it to five star two.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:46,500 –&gt; 00:09:49,539<br>Right? So the thing in the box is our equivalent.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:49,539 –&gt; 00:09:54,299<br>And then again, five star two, I’m going to recognize this is the same problem I’ve been trying to solve.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:54,299 –&gt; 00:10:04,299<br>Let’s apply the same solution, which is to extract a five out and add it to the multiplication of five star one less.</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:04,299 –&gt; 00:10:07,179<br>So again, the two boxes are equivalent.</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:07,179 –&gt; 00:10:13,419<br>So this idea here where we’re recognizing the same problem and kind of dividing it, dividing it,</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:13,419 –&gt; 00:10:25,019<br>having this trust that at some point we’re going to divide it so much that we’ve reached a fundamental fact that we can solve is this divide step.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:25,019 –&gt; 00:10:30,979<br>So we’re going to divide it all the way down here where I’ve got five plus five star one.</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:30,979 –&gt; 00:10:36,139<br>At this point, I can say, well, five star one is going to be five.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:36,139 –&gt; 00:10:39,059<br>This is a basic fact that I can just solve.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:39,059 –&gt; 00:10:42,980<br>I don’t need to divide this problem any further.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:42,980 –&gt; 00:10:47,539<br>So once I solve this fact, I can start building back up my answer, right?</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:47,539 –&gt; 00:10:55,820<br>And I can start passing the answer back up the chain of multiplication calls, right?</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:55,820 –&gt; 00:11:01,379<br>So if I’m at this step here and I figured out that this is five star one, this five star one is equal to five,</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:01,379 –&gt; 00:11:04,259<br>I can just replace it with the five.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:04,259 –&gt; 00:11:11,620<br>And then I can build up the solution to this five star two because now five star two is just five plus five.</p>
<p>147<br>00:11:13,980 –&gt; 00:11:16,899<br>So this is going to be 10, right?</p>
<p>148<br>00:11:16,899 –&gt; 00:11:18,500<br>It’s just simple addition, right?</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:18,500 –&gt; 00:11:23,100<br>There’s no more multiplication, which is the thing that we were trying to avoid.</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:23,100 –&gt; 00:11:30,860<br>So then the five star two gets replaced with 10 and I’m still building back up my solution until I get to the five star four.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:30,860 –&gt; 00:11:38,580<br>So I was trying to figure out what five star three is, but before I could do that, I had to solve the rest of the two lines beneath it.</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:38,580 –&gt; 00:11:40,019<br>But now I can finally solve it.</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:40,019 –&gt; 00:11:42,100<br>It’s just five plus 10.</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:42,100 –&gt; 00:11:44,860<br>Right? That’s the similar problem I was trying to solve.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:44,860 –&gt; 00:11:48,620<br>So I can replace the five star three with 15.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:48,620 –&gt; 00:12:00,820<br>And finally, my original problem was trying to figure out five star four and now I can finally solve it because I finally built back up my solution as five plus 15.</p>
<p>157<br>00:12:00,820 –&gt; 00:12:05,700<br>Any questions about these steps should be pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>158<br>00:12:05,700 –&gt; 00:12:11,980<br>I know it’s a weird roundabout way of figuring out what the answer is, but what I’m trying to get at is trying to recognize</p>
<p>159<br>00:12:11,980 –&gt; 00:12:18,740<br>the problem that we’re trying to solve and then solving a very similar problem just slightly changed.</p>
<p>160<br>00:12:18,740 –&gt; 00:12:24,940<br>In this case, we’re multiplying five star one less than what we were just trying to figure out.</p>
<p>161<br>00:12:24,940 –&gt; 00:12:36,580<br>So in terms of the recursion for this particular problem, multiplying A with B, we recognize that A star B is going to be A plus A plus A plus A plus A plus B times.</p>
<p>162<br>00:12:36,580 –&gt; 00:12:48,980<br>If we extract an A out just like when we extracted the five out and added it to something else, we’ll recognize that that’s just A plus A plus A plus A plus A plus A plus A plus A plus A B minus one times.</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:48,980 –&gt; 00:12:50,500<br>Right?</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:50,500 –&gt; 00:12:51,860<br>Okay?</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:51,860 –&gt; 00:13:01,740<br>Well, that A plus A plus A plus A B minus one times is just our original problem, just multiplying A with B minus one.</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:01,740 –&gt; 00:13:04,419<br>So this is my recursive step.</p>
<p>167<br>00:13:04,419 –&gt; 00:13:09,220<br>We recognize that A star B is equal to A plus A star B minus one.</p>
<p>168<br>00:13:09,220 –&gt; 00:13:18,460<br>So I’m using the same operation I’m trying to find here, down here in my, in my quote unquote solution.</p>
<p>169<br>00:13:18,460 –&gt; 00:13:27,340<br>But this is not the end of recursion because if I just had this as my definition, then I would have infinite recursion.</p>
<p>170<br>00:13:27,340 –&gt; 00:13:29,220<br>I don’t have a way to stop.</p>
<p>171<br>00:13:29,220 –&gt; 00:13:40,220<br>And so this recursive step in conjunction with a base case, something that is fun, that we know fundamentally about the star operator is going to give us our solution.</p>
<p>172<br>00:13:40,220 –&gt; 00:13:45,820<br>So we knew on the previous slide when we multiply A with one, we just get back A.</p>
<p>173<br>00:13:45,820 –&gt; 00:13:48,100<br>So our base case, right?</p>
<p>174<br>00:13:48,100 –&gt; 00:13:53,460<br>Very simple case of multiplication between A and B is going to be one B is one.</p>
<p>175<br>00:13:53,460 –&gt; 00:13:57,740<br>And that’s going to be A times B is equal to A.</p>
<p>176<br>00:13:57,740 –&gt; 00:14:04,060<br>So these might look like the mathematical definitions that you might come up with in a math class.</p>
<p>177<br>00:14:04,060 –&gt; 00:14:05,500<br>And we have them right here, right?</p>
<p>178<br>00:14:05,500 –&gt; 00:14:10,419<br>So if B is not equal to one, A times B is A plus A times B minus one.</p>
<p>179<br>00:14:10,419 –&gt; 00:14:15,820<br>And then the base case, right, is when B is equal to one, A times B is equal to A.</p>
<p>180<br>00:14:15,820 –&gt; 00:14:27,580<br>So with these two lines, we can actually come up with the code, the programming version of this function.</p>
<p>181<br>00:14:27,580 –&gt; 00:14:32,780<br>So here we’re creating a function named Moltreker.</p>
<p>182<br>00:14:32,780 –&gt; 00:14:35,460<br>And its parameters are going to be A and B, right?</p>
<p>183<br>00:14:35,460 –&gt; 00:14:38,180<br>So I’m multiplying A with B.</p>
<p>184<br>00:14:38,180 –&gt; 00:14:44,420<br>And I have to encode these two cases when B is one and otherwise.</p>
<p>185<br>00:14:44,420 –&gt; 00:14:46,500<br>So we usually start with the base case.</p>
<p>186<br>00:14:46,500 –&gt; 00:14:48,620<br>It’s the simplest to think about.</p>
<p>187<br>00:14:48,620 –&gt; 00:14:51,740<br>So when B is one, A times B is equal to A, right?</p>
<p>188<br>00:14:51,740 –&gt; 00:14:56,420<br>So when if B is equal to one, then what is A times B?</p>
<p>189<br>00:14:56,419 –&gt; 00:14:57,579<br>It’s just A, right?</p>
<p>190<br>00:14:57,579 –&gt; 00:15:02,620<br>So the function can just immediately, immediately, return A.</p>
<p>191<br>00:15:02,620 –&gt; 00:15:05,219<br>Else, so that’s our base case.</p>
<p>192<br>00:15:05,219 –&gt; 00:15:09,259<br>Else, this is going to be our recursive step.</p>
<p>193<br>00:15:09,259 –&gt; 00:15:13,579<br>We’re not going to return A, but we will return this, right?</p>
<p>194<br>00:15:13,579 –&gt; 00:15:16,539<br>A plus A star B minus one.</p>
<p>195<br>00:15:16,539 –&gt; 00:15:19,740<br>Well, the A is just A plus.</p>
<p>196<br>00:15:19,740 –&gt; 00:15:23,779<br>And this, the star operator between A and B minus one,</p>
<p>197<br>00:15:23,779 –&gt; 00:15:25,779<br>is just the function again.</p>
<p>198<br>00:15:29,500 –&gt; 00:15:31,100<br>Isn’t that really cool?</p>
<p>199<br>00:15:31,100 –&gt; 00:15:35,940<br>We’re using the function name in the body of this function</p>
<p>200<br>00:15:35,940 –&gt; 00:15:38,419<br>that we’re defining.</p>
<p>201<br>00:15:38,419 –&gt; 00:15:41,980<br>And it’s not a problem because the parameter to the one</p>
<p>202<br>00:15:41,980 –&gt; 00:15:45,940<br>at the bottom and the recursive step is changing, right?</p>
<p>203<br>00:15:45,940 –&gt; 00:15:49,019<br>I’m not calling Moltreker with A comma B again.</p>
<p>204<br>00:15:49,019 –&gt; 00:15:51,299<br>That would be very silly of me because that</p>
<p>205<br>00:15:51,299 –&gt; 00:15:52,579<br>would lead to infinite recursion.</p>
<p>206<br>00:15:52,579 –&gt; 00:15:55,340<br>I’m not making any progress towards a base case.</p>
<p>207<br>00:15:55,340 –&gt; 00:15:58,419<br>But I am calling it with B minus one.</p>
<p>208<br>00:15:58,419 –&gt; 00:16:02,779<br>So this function will just keep calling Moltreker with A</p>
<p>209<br>00:16:02,779 –&gt; 00:16:05,460<br>with B, B minus one, B minus two, B and three, and so on,</p>
<p>210<br>00:16:05,460 –&gt; 00:16:06,980<br>until it gets to B as one.</p>
<p>211<br>00:16:06,980 –&gt; 00:16:09,059<br>And then it’ll build back up the solution just</p>
<p>212<br>00:16:09,059 –&gt; 00:16:11,539<br>like we had in the slides with all the parentheses</p>
<p>213<br>00:16:11,539 –&gt; 00:16:14,659<br>that we were replacing.</p>
<p>214<br>00:16:14,659 –&gt; 00:16:16,939<br>So let’s step through the Python tutor.</p>
<p>215<br>00:16:16,940 –&gt; 00:16:19,380<br>And I will show you how it actually</p>
<p>216<br>00:16:19,380 –&gt; 00:16:21,420<br>looks when we make all these function calls.</p>
<p>217<br>00:16:21,420 –&gt; 00:16:24,220<br>And then we’ll do another example.</p>
<p>218<br>00:16:24,220 –&gt; 00:16:29,100<br>So here I’ve got Moltreker with A is, I think I ran it,</p>
<p>219<br>00:16:29,100 –&gt; 00:16:31,820<br>yet with five and four, just like the one</p>
<p>220<br>00:16:31,820 –&gt; 00:16:33,540<br>we’ve been looking at.</p>
<p>221<br>00:16:33,540 –&gt; 00:16:36,220<br>So this is going to be my main function.</p>
<p>222<br>00:16:36,220 –&gt; 00:16:40,700<br>It makes a function called to Moltreker, excuse me, five,</p>
<p>223<br>00:16:40,700 –&gt; 00:16:41,780<br>comma four.</p>
<p>224<br>00:16:41,780 –&gt; 00:16:45,460<br>So my A is five and my B is four.</p>
<p>225<br>00:16:45,460 –&gt; 00:16:47,220<br>This is this little blue thing here</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:47,220 –&gt; 00:16:49,820<br>is one function environment.</p>
<p>227<br>00:16:49,820 –&gt; 00:16:52,580<br>Like when I draw boxes on my slides that are orange,</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:52,580 –&gt; 00:16:53,379<br>they do them in blue.</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:57,220 –&gt; 00:17:00,060<br>Now in this function call, what do we do?</p>
<p>230<br>00:17:00,060 –&gt; 00:17:01,660<br>Is B1?</p>
<p>231<br>00:17:01,660 –&gt; 00:17:02,300<br>No.</p>
<p>232<br>00:17:02,300 –&gt; 00:17:06,980<br>So we go in the else case and we return five plus.</p>
<p>233<br>00:17:06,980 –&gt; 00:17:08,019<br>What happens next?</p>
<p>234<br>00:17:08,019 –&gt; 00:17:08,539<br>Does anyone know?</p>
<p>235<br>00:17:08,539 –&gt; 00:17:13,539<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>236<br>00:17:13,539 –&gt; 00:17:17,539<br>Moltreker is going to run again with A is five.</p>
<p>237<br>00:17:17,539 –&gt; 00:17:18,859<br>Yes.</p>
<p>238<br>00:17:18,859 –&gt; 00:17:21,659<br>Moltreker will run again with A is five and B is three.</p>
<p>239<br>00:17:21,659 –&gt; 00:17:22,700<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>240<br>00:17:22,700 –&gt; 00:17:25,539<br>It is a function call, right?</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:25,539 –&gt; 00:17:28,139<br>So as a function call, we are going</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:28,139 –&gt; 00:17:31,059<br>to create a new environment.</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:31,059 –&gt; 00:17:34,420<br>So here’s another box.</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:34,420 –&gt; 00:17:39,220<br>My previous box is currently hung up.</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:39,220 –&gt; 00:17:41,740<br>It cannot finish because it’s trying</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:41,740 –&gt; 00:17:46,340<br>to figure out what A, what five plus the result of this function</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:46,340 –&gt; 00:17:46,779<br>call is.</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:46,779 –&gt; 00:17:48,420<br>But this one’s not done yet, right?</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:48,420 –&gt; 00:17:53,259<br>It’s still figuring out it’s result.</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:53,259 –&gt; 00:17:55,180<br>So we’ve put that one on hold.</p>
<p>251<br>00:17:55,180 –&gt; 00:17:58,019<br>And now we’re trying to figure out Moltreker, five, comma three.</p>
<p>252<br>00:17:58,019 –&gt; 00:17:59,700<br>Well, what is Moltreker, five, comma three?</p>
<p>253<br>00:17:59,700 –&gt; 00:18:01,940<br>It’s going to be B is not one.</p>
<p>254<br>00:18:01,940 –&gt; 00:18:05,820<br>So this one will also go in its else.</p>
<p>255<br>00:18:05,820 –&gt; 00:18:11,140<br>And it will return five plus what?</p>
<p>256<br>00:18:16,620 –&gt; 00:18:18,140<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>257<br>00:18:18,140 –&gt; 00:18:21,420<br>The function call when B becomes two, exactly.</p>
<p>258<br>00:18:21,420 –&gt; 00:18:24,940<br>But notice, it is another function call, right?</p>
<p>259<br>00:18:24,940 –&gt; 00:18:28,340<br>So here I have, boom, another box.</p>
<p>260<br>00:18:28,339 –&gt; 00:18:32,339<br>Now I’ve got two function calls, this original one back here,</p>
<p>261<br>00:18:32,339 –&gt; 00:18:36,099<br>which was waiting on this one that I’ve highlighted here.</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:36,099 –&gt; 00:18:38,339<br>But now this one that I’ve highlighted here</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:38,339 –&gt; 00:18:41,779<br>had to make another function call down here.</p>
<p>264<br>00:18:41,779 –&gt; 00:18:45,179<br>So I’ve got currently three function calls in the works</p>
<p>265<br>00:18:45,179 –&gt; 00:18:49,179<br>that are trying to figure out what their results are.</p>
<p>266<br>00:18:49,179 –&gt; 00:18:51,419<br>Finally, this Moltreker, five, comma two,</p>
<p>267<br>00:18:51,419 –&gt; 00:18:53,899<br>is going to make another function call.</p>
<p>268<br>00:18:53,899 –&gt; 00:18:55,099<br>So it’s B is not one.</p>
<p>269<br>00:18:55,099 –&gt; 00:18:56,819<br>So we’re going to go into the else.</p>
<p>270<br>00:18:59,339 –&gt; 00:19:01,819<br>And what is its else going to say?</p>
<p>271<br>00:19:01,819 –&gt; 00:19:06,059<br>We’re going to return five plus.</p>
<p>272<br>00:19:06,059 –&gt; 00:19:09,339<br>And it’s another function call.</p>
<p>273<br>00:19:09,339 –&gt; 00:19:12,059<br>So now I’m four function calls deep.</p>
<p>274<br>00:19:12,059 –&gt; 00:19:17,339<br>And I haven’t done any sort of visible work, right?</p>
<p>275<br>00:19:17,339 –&gt; 00:19:20,740<br>I’ve just kept kind of kicking the can down the road</p>
<p>276<br>00:19:20,740 –&gt; 00:19:23,779<br>to try to figure out what the values are.</p>
<p>277<br>00:19:23,779 –&gt; 00:19:25,980<br>And everybody’s waiting for somebody else</p>
<p>278<br>00:19:25,980 –&gt; 00:19:29,380<br>to finally return a value.</p>
<p>279<br>00:19:29,380 –&gt; 00:19:33,220<br>So this first one is waiting for the one right underneath it</p>
<p>280<br>00:19:33,220 –&gt; 00:19:34,460<br>to return a value.</p>
<p>281<br>00:19:34,460 –&gt; 00:19:36,460<br>But this one is waiting for the one underneath it</p>
<p>282<br>00:19:36,460 –&gt; 00:19:37,700<br>to return a value.</p>
<p>283<br>00:19:37,700 –&gt; 00:19:39,900<br>And this one is waiting for the one underneath it</p>
<p>284<br>00:19:39,900 –&gt; 00:19:40,660<br>to return a value.</p>
<p>285<br>00:19:40,660 –&gt; 00:19:42,900<br>That’s the chain of calls.</p>
<p>286<br>00:19:42,900 –&gt; 00:19:44,579<br>What’s this last one going to do?</p>
<p>287<br>00:19:44,579 –&gt; 00:19:47,819<br>Is it going to make another function environment?</p>
<p>288<br>00:19:47,819 –&gt; 00:19:48,420<br>No.</p>
<p>289<br>00:19:48,420 –&gt; 00:19:51,860<br>It’s going to return A, which is five.</p>
<p>290<br>00:19:51,859 –&gt; 00:19:57,379<br>OK, there’s my return value five.</p>
<p>291<br>00:19:57,379 –&gt; 00:20:01,379<br>So this one will return the five to whoever called it.</p>
<p>292<br>00:20:01,379 –&gt; 00:20:03,500<br>And whoever called it was this one here.</p>
<p>293<br>00:20:03,500 –&gt; 00:20:06,179<br>We’ll recur five comma two, right?</p>
<p>294<br>00:20:06,179 –&gt; 00:20:11,500<br>Five comma two was trying to figure out what five plus this bottom</p>
<p>295<br>00:20:11,500 –&gt; 00:20:13,740<br>function call was.</p>
<p>296<br>00:20:13,740 –&gt; 00:20:17,539<br>Well, now it can figure out that it’s going to be five plus five.</p>
<p>297<br>00:20:17,539 –&gt; 00:20:20,339<br>So its return will be 10.</p>
<p>298<br>00:20:20,339 –&gt; 00:20:24,539<br>This one returns a value up one level to whoever called it.</p>
<p>299<br>00:20:24,539 –&gt; 00:20:26,740<br>And that was molt recur five comma three.</p>
<p>300<br>00:20:26,740 –&gt; 00:20:30,539<br>And now molt recur five comma three can finish its job.</p>
<p>301<br>00:20:30,539 –&gt; 00:20:34,220<br>It was trying to figure out what five plus its function</p>
<p>302<br>00:20:34,220 –&gt; 00:20:36,539<br>call was, which is we figured out as 10.</p>
<p>303<br>00:20:36,539 –&gt; 00:20:39,619<br>So this one can figure out its 15.</p>
<p>304<br>00:20:39,619 –&gt; 00:20:42,779<br>And finally, this last value can return back up</p>
<p>305<br>00:20:42,779 –&gt; 00:20:46,939<br>to the original function call five comma four.</p>
<p>306<br>00:20:46,940 –&gt; 00:20:50,460<br>And five comma four will return five plus the 15 that got</p>
<p>307<br>00:20:50,460 –&gt; 00:20:51,900<br>returned, which is 20.</p>
<p>308<br>00:20:55,019 –&gt; 00:20:58,420<br>OK, questions about what just happened?</p>
<p>309<br>00:21:01,420 –&gt; 00:21:03,620<br>Does everything make sense?</p>
<p>310<br>00:21:03,620 –&gt; 00:21:04,900<br>All right.</p>
<p>311<br>00:21:04,900 –&gt; 00:21:09,019<br>OK, so let’s look at one more example.</p>
<p>312<br>00:21:09,019 –&gt; 00:21:11,180<br>I mean, we’ll look at a few more examples this lecture.</p>
<p>313<br>00:21:11,180 –&gt; 00:21:14,380<br>But let’s look at a real world example for now.</p>
<p>314<br>00:21:14,380 –&gt; 00:21:16,900<br>This one will hopefully illustrate the difference</p>
<p>315<br>00:21:16,900 –&gt; 00:21:20,340<br>between iterative algorithms and recursive algorithms</p>
<p>316<br>00:21:20,340 –&gt; 00:21:22,300<br>in a more real life setting.</p>
<p>317<br>00:21:22,300 –&gt; 00:21:27,100<br>So let’s assume that in this real world setting,</p>
<p>318<br>00:21:27,100 –&gt; 00:21:29,300<br>a student asks for regrade for an exam.</p>
<p>319<br>00:21:32,260 –&gt; 00:21:36,540<br>In an iterative setting, we have basically one function call,</p>
<p>320<br>00:21:36,540 –&gt; 00:21:38,820<br>right, regrade or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>321<br>00:21:38,820 –&gt; 00:21:40,980<br>There’s my student.</p>
<p>322<br>00:21:40,980 –&gt; 00:21:44,380<br>How is the student going to iteratively get the regrade?</p>
<p>323<br>00:21:44,380 –&gt; 00:21:47,980<br>Well, the student will be in charge of basically looping</p>
<p>324<br>00:21:47,980 –&gt; 00:21:51,539<br>through each staff member, right?</p>
<p>325<br>00:21:51,539 –&gt; 00:21:54,660<br>So the student goes to the instructor and says,</p>
<p>326<br>00:21:54,660 –&gt; 00:21:56,819<br>can I have a regrade please?</p>
<p>327<br>00:21:56,819 –&gt; 00:21:59,299<br>OK, the instructor may have graded one problem.</p>
<p>328<br>00:21:59,299 –&gt; 00:22:01,860<br>Maybe they didn’t, but they will regrade the problem</p>
<p>329<br>00:22:01,860 –&gt; 00:22:05,059<br>that maybe they were in charge of.</p>
<p>330<br>00:22:05,059 –&gt; 00:22:09,500<br>Then the student will go to the next person on staff, the TA.</p>
<p>331<br>00:22:09,500 –&gt; 00:22:11,619<br>Can I have a regrade please?</p>
<p>332<br>00:22:11,619 –&gt; 00:22:14,339<br>Let’s say the TA maybe regrades the problem they were in charge</p>
<p>333<br>00:22:14,339 –&gt; 00:22:15,940<br>of, maybe they didn’t, but in any case,</p>
<p>334<br>00:22:15,940 –&gt; 00:22:20,779<br>they’ll give the score back or they’ll answer the students’ request.</p>
<p>335<br>00:22:20,779 –&gt; 00:22:24,380<br>But the student then goes to the next person on staff,</p>
<p>336<br>00:22:24,380 –&gt; 00:22:26,740<br>the lab assistant.</p>
<p>337<br>00:22:26,740 –&gt; 00:22:27,700<br>Can I have a regrade please?</p>
<p>338<br>00:22:27,700 –&gt; 00:22:29,539<br>The lab assistant might regrade the problem</p>
<p>339<br>00:22:29,539 –&gt; 00:22:31,779<br>later in charge of, you know, whatever,</p>
<p>340<br>00:22:31,779 –&gt; 00:22:33,420<br>gives the grade back to the student.</p>
<p>341<br>00:22:33,420 –&gt; 00:22:36,460<br>The student is keeping track of all these regrades scores</p>
<p>342<br>00:22:36,460 –&gt; 00:22:37,859<br>that they’re getting to figure out</p>
<p>343<br>00:22:37,859 –&gt; 00:22:39,659<br>what their new total score is.</p>
<p>344<br>00:22:39,659 –&gt; 00:22:44,059<br>And finally, the student might go to the grader,</p>
<p>345<br>00:22:44,059 –&gt; 00:22:46,259<br>who did probably most of the work,</p>
<p>346<br>00:22:46,259 –&gt; 00:22:48,339<br>asks for the regrade, the grader will,</p>
<p>347<br>00:22:48,339 –&gt; 00:22:51,139<br>do the fee, agree to do the regrade,</p>
<p>348<br>00:22:51,139 –&gt; 00:22:53,500<br>and pass back the values.</p>
<p>349<br>00:22:53,500 –&gt; 00:22:56,219<br>So here, notice the student is in charge</p>
<p>350<br>00:22:56,219 –&gt; 00:23:00,059<br>of iteratively going to every single person on staff</p>
<p>351<br>00:23:00,059 –&gt; 00:23:02,219<br>and getting the result back.</p>
<p>352<br>00:23:02,219 –&gt; 00:23:04,979<br>And the student is keeping track of what their new score is.</p>
<p>353<br>00:23:04,979 –&gt; 00:23:06,500<br>Obviously, the staff members will too</p>
<p>354<br>00:23:06,500 –&gt; 00:23:08,099<br>for the purposes of assigning grades,</p>
<p>355<br>00:23:08,099 –&gt; 00:23:10,779<br>but the student is as well.</p>
<p>356<br>00:23:10,779 –&gt; 00:23:13,539<br>So the student’s basically adding up all these values.</p>
<p>357<br>00:23:13,539 –&gt; 00:23:15,059<br>But there is only one function call.</p>
<p>358<br>00:23:15,059 –&gt; 00:23:18,380<br>So I’ve denoted the function call using just this black circle</p>
<p>359<br>00:23:18,380 –&gt; 00:23:20,380<br>here.</p>
<p>360<br>00:23:20,380 –&gt; 00:23:21,859<br>OK, so that’s iteration.</p>
<p>361<br>00:23:21,859 –&gt; 00:23:22,700<br>We know how to do that.</p>
<p>362<br>00:23:22,700 –&gt; 00:23:25,539<br>We’ve been doing this for a really long time in this class.</p>
<p>363<br>00:23:25,539 –&gt; 00:23:29,500<br>But now let’s look at the same problem recursively.</p>
<p>364<br>00:23:29,500 –&gt; 00:23:33,579<br>So in recursion, we’ve got these two steps, right?</p>
<p>365<br>00:23:33,579 –&gt; 00:23:37,179<br>There’s the problem of decreasing our original problem</p>
<p>366<br>00:23:37,179 –&gt; 00:23:41,539<br>into smaller problems, right, until we reach sub sort of base</p>
<p>367<br>00:23:41,539 –&gt; 00:23:43,539<br>case.</p>
<p>368<br>00:23:43,539 –&gt; 00:23:46,619<br>And then at that point, we have the task</p>
<p>369<br>00:23:46,619 –&gt; 00:23:50,539<br>of building back up our answer.</p>
<p>370<br>00:23:50,539 –&gt; 00:23:52,179<br>So in the recursive setting, again,</p>
<p>371<br>00:23:52,179 –&gt; 00:23:54,339<br>I’ve got my one function called to regrade</p>
<p>372<br>00:23:54,339 –&gt; 00:23:56,699<br>on behalf of the student.</p>
<p>373<br>00:23:56,699 –&gt; 00:24:00,339<br>But the student will only interact with one person,</p>
<p>374<br>00:24:00,339 –&gt; 00:24:02,579<br>maybe the instructor.</p>
<p>375<br>00:24:02,579 –&gt; 00:24:05,460<br>The student will not interact with anybody else in staff.</p>
<p>376<br>00:24:05,460 –&gt; 00:24:07,259<br>The student will just go up to the instructor and say,</p>
<p>377<br>00:24:07,259 –&gt; 00:24:10,500<br>hey, I would like your regrade for this exam.</p>
<p>378<br>00:24:10,500 –&gt; 00:24:15,019<br>OK, now the student is going to wait, right?</p>
<p>379<br>00:24:15,019 –&gt; 00:24:19,259<br>The instructor is also a function call to regrade.</p>
<p>380<br>00:24:19,259 –&gt; 00:24:21,899<br>So maybe the instructor didn’t do any of the grading.</p>
<p>381<br>00:24:21,899 –&gt; 00:24:24,099<br>But the instructor will make their own function</p>
<p>382<br>00:24:24,099 –&gt; 00:24:25,139<br>call to the TA.</p>
<p>383<br>00:24:25,139 –&gt; 00:24:28,579<br>Can you please regrade this exam?</p>
<p>384<br>00:24:28,579 –&gt; 00:24:30,259<br>The TA may be graded one problem.</p>
<p>385<br>00:24:30,259 –&gt; 00:24:32,059<br>They’ll keep track of the problem they need to grade.</p>
<p>386<br>00:24:32,059 –&gt; 00:24:33,980<br>But there are other problems that need to be graded.</p>
<p>387<br>00:24:33,980 –&gt; 00:24:37,579<br>So the TA will then ask make their own function call</p>
<p>388<br>00:24:37,579 –&gt; 00:24:38,980<br>to the lab assistant.</p>
<p>389<br>00:24:38,980 –&gt; 00:24:41,419<br>Maybe the lab assistant graded some problems.</p>
<p>390<br>00:24:41,419 –&gt; 00:24:45,460<br>And then the lab assistant will also make further the request</p>
<p>391<br>00:24:45,460 –&gt; 00:24:48,259<br>sort of passing along the function call to the grader.</p>
<p>392<br>00:24:48,259 –&gt; 00:24:51,419<br>So we have the task of doing the regrading as a function</p>
<p>393<br>00:24:51,419 –&gt; 00:24:55,700<br>being passed along all of the staff members.</p>
<p>394<br>00:24:55,700 –&gt; 00:24:57,419<br>When we reach the base case, which</p>
<p>395<br>00:24:57,419 –&gt; 00:24:59,980<br>is the last, the grader, that needs</p>
<p>396<br>00:24:59,980 –&gt; 00:25:05,819<br>that probably knows or probably graded the last question,</p>
<p>397<br>00:25:05,819 –&gt; 00:25:08,259<br>we’ve got the answer being passed back up</p>
<p>398<br>00:25:08,259 –&gt; 00:25:11,059<br>the chain of function calls, right?</p>
<p>399<br>00:25:11,059 –&gt; 00:25:13,460<br>So the grader will say, all right, I’ve graded my problem.</p>
<p>400<br>00:25:13,460 –&gt; 00:25:15,140<br>There’s nobody else I need to ask.</p>
<p>401<br>00:25:15,140 –&gt; 00:25:16,980<br>So here’s my score.</p>
<p>402<br>00:25:16,980 –&gt; 00:25:19,539<br>So this score is being passed back up the chain of function</p>
<p>403<br>00:25:19,539 –&gt; 00:25:21,220<br>calls to the lab assistant.</p>
<p>404<br>00:25:21,220 –&gt; 00:25:24,860<br>The lab assistant will take that score and add it to their score.</p>
<p>405<br>00:25:24,860 –&gt; 00:25:28,099<br>Passes it back up the chain of function calls</p>
<p>406<br>00:25:28,099 –&gt; 00:25:30,459<br>to the teaching assistant.</p>
<p>407<br>00:25:30,459 –&gt; 00:25:33,740<br>The teaching assistant adds that score to their score.</p>
<p>408<br>00:25:33,740 –&gt; 00:25:34,939<br>Maybe they graded a problem.</p>
<p>409<br>00:25:34,939 –&gt; 00:25:36,059<br>Maybe they didn’t.</p>
<p>410<br>00:25:36,059 –&gt; 00:25:37,980<br>But anyway, they’re compiling the result</p>
<p>411<br>00:25:37,980 –&gt; 00:25:41,339<br>little by little back up until passes it to the instructor.</p>
<p>412<br>00:25:41,339 –&gt; 00:25:42,939<br>And then the instructor says, here you go.</p>
<p>413<br>00:25:42,939 –&gt; 00:25:44,419<br>This is your score.</p>
<p>414<br>00:25:44,419 –&gt; 00:25:45,659<br>So you see the difference, right?</p>
<p>415<br>00:25:45,659 –&gt; 00:25:48,139<br>The student is the iteration.</p>
<p>416<br>00:25:48,139 –&gt; 00:25:50,299<br>They ask everybody on staff.</p>
<p>417<br>00:25:50,299 –&gt; 00:25:52,659<br>So they interact with everybody on staff.</p>
<p>418<br>00:25:52,659 –&gt; 00:25:56,219<br>But in recursion, the student is basically hung up waiting</p>
<p>419<br>00:25:56,220 –&gt; 00:26:00,980<br>for an answer until we’ve gone down all these chain of function</p>
<p>420<br>00:26:00,980 –&gt; 00:26:03,420<br>calls and the answer has been built back up.</p>
<p>421<br>00:26:03,420 –&gt; 00:26:06,700<br>So the student is not keeping track of the answer at all.</p>
<p>422<br>00:26:06,700 –&gt; 00:26:11,059<br>They only get the final answer at the end.</p>
<p>423<br>00:26:11,059 –&gt; 00:26:12,940<br>Would that help at all?</p>
<p>424<br>00:26:12,940 –&gt; 00:26:14,740<br>I refine this example a couple of times.</p>
<p>425<br>00:26:14,740 –&gt; 00:26:18,059<br>Hopefully this is good.</p>
<p>426<br>00:26:18,059 –&gt; 00:26:20,019<br>So the big idea in recursion here is</p>
<p>427<br>00:26:20,019 –&gt; 00:26:22,620<br>got, I’ve got these, quote unquote, earlier function calls,</p>
<p>428<br>00:26:22,620 –&gt; 00:26:22,819<br>right?</p>
<p>429<br>00:26:22,819 –&gt; 00:26:25,860<br>The ones I’ve made way back at the beginning,</p>
<p>430<br>00:26:25,859 –&gt; 00:26:30,819<br>these function calls are just waiting on results to come back.</p>
<p>431<br>00:26:30,819 –&gt; 00:26:33,419<br>They’re not doing any useful work at the beginning.</p>
<p>432<br>00:26:33,419 –&gt; 00:26:37,500<br>They only do useful work when they’re assembling the results</p>
<p>433<br>00:26:37,500 –&gt; 00:26:41,899<br>after getting a return back from later function calls.</p>
<p>434<br>00:26:41,899 –&gt; 00:26:47,019<br>So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we can apply recursion.</p>
<p>435<br>00:26:47,019 –&gt; 00:26:48,899<br>Now, what exactly is recursion?</p>
<p>436<br>00:26:48,899 –&gt; 00:26:51,579<br>So algorithmically, it’s a way for us</p>
<p>437<br>00:26:51,579 –&gt; 00:26:54,019<br>to come up with some solutions to some problems</p>
<p>438<br>00:26:54,019 –&gt; 00:26:57,420<br>in this dividing conquer approach or decrease in conquer approach.</p>
<p>439<br>00:26:57,420 –&gt; 00:26:59,019<br>You have your original problem.</p>
<p>440<br>00:26:59,019 –&gt; 00:27:03,059<br>You divide it so much into the same problem just slightly</p>
<p>441<br>00:27:03,059 –&gt; 00:27:05,299<br>changed until you reach a base case.</p>
<p>442<br>00:27:05,299 –&gt; 00:27:08,259<br>That base case can kick off the conquer step</p>
<p>443<br>00:27:08,259 –&gt; 00:27:10,539<br>and start passing back a value that you</p>
<p>444<br>00:27:10,539 –&gt; 00:27:15,740<br>can start assembling from your earlier function calls.</p>
<p>445<br>00:27:15,740 –&gt; 00:27:18,099<br>Now, semantically, as we saw in the example</p>
<p>446<br>00:27:18,099 –&gt; 00:27:21,099<br>where we multiplied the functions, we’ve got a function that calls</p>
<p>447<br>00:27:21,099 –&gt; 00:27:22,299<br>itself.</p>
<p>448<br>00:27:22,299 –&gt; 00:27:25,460<br>Obviously, it’s not calling itself with the exact same parameters</p>
<p>449<br>00:27:25,460 –&gt; 00:27:27,299<br>because that would lead to infinite recursion.</p>
<p>450<br>00:27:27,299 –&gt; 00:27:28,899<br>And that’s not what we want.</p>
<p>451<br>00:27:28,899 –&gt; 00:27:32,980<br>We’re going to call ourselves with a slight change in our parameters</p>
<p>452<br>00:27:32,980 –&gt; 00:27:37,180<br>in such a way that we will reach our base case.</p>
<p>453<br>00:27:37,180 –&gt; 00:27:39,339<br>And once we reach the base case, then again,</p>
<p>454<br>00:27:39,339 –&gt; 00:27:42,379<br>we kick off the conquer step and we can start reassembling back.</p>
<p>455<br>00:27:42,379 –&gt; 00:27:48,220<br>And you saw how the function calls do that when they help each other back up.</p>
<p>456<br>00:27:48,220 –&gt; 00:27:50,220<br>I’m going to give you a couple of minutes to try this.</p>
<p>457<br>00:27:50,220 –&gt; 00:27:53,019<br>So complete the function that calculates</p>
<p>458<br>00:27:53,019 –&gt; 00:27:54,740<br>n to the power of p for these variables.</p>
<p>459<br>00:27:54,740 –&gt; 00:27:57,339<br>So if you come up with the mathematical definition,</p>
<p>460<br>00:27:57,339 –&gt; 00:28:01,700<br>it will be a pretty straight translation to code.</p>
<p>461<br>00:28:01,700 –&gt; 00:28:04,220<br>I did include two base cases here.</p>
<p>462<br>00:28:04,220 –&gt; 00:28:09,180<br>So maybe a base case is when n is 0 and another base case is when n is 1.</p>
<p>463<br>00:28:09,180 –&gt; 00:28:11,420<br>Figure out what you should return and then how</p>
<p>464<br>00:28:11,420 –&gt; 00:28:13,500<br>to write this recursive step.</p>
<p>465<br>00:28:13,500 –&gt; 00:28:24,460<br>So I’ve got line 50-ish is where I can type in the code.</p>
<p>466<br>00:28:24,460 –&gt; 00:28:25,259<br>All right.</p>
<p>467<br>00:28:25,259 –&gt; 00:28:28,779<br>What’s my first base case?</p>
<p>468<br>00:28:28,779 –&gt; 00:28:29,299<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>469<br>00:28:32,380 –&gt; 00:28:33,380<br>Yep.</p>
<p>470<br>00:28:33,380 –&gt; 00:28:37,380<br>If p is equal to 0, then we can return 1.</p>
<p>471<br>00:28:37,380 –&gt; 00:28:38,059<br>Oops.</p>
<p>472<br>00:28:38,059 –&gt; 00:28:39,099<br>Just one time.</p>
<p>473<br>00:28:39,099 –&gt; 00:28:40,140<br>That’s another base case.</p>
<p>474<br>00:28:43,819 –&gt; 00:28:46,619<br>P is 1.</p>
<p>475<br>00:28:46,619 –&gt; 00:28:50,579<br>We can return n.</p>
<p>476<br>00:28:50,579 –&gt; 00:28:51,700<br>Awesome.</p>
<p>477<br>00:28:51,700 –&gt; 00:28:52,700<br>How about my recursive step?</p>
<p>478<br>00:29:01,220 –&gt; 00:29:01,460<br>Yep.</p>
<p>479<br>00:29:01,460 –&gt; 00:29:10,019<br>We can return n times like this.</p>
<p>480<br>00:29:10,019 –&gt; 00:29:12,660<br>Now let’s assume I don’t know how to do star star.</p>
<p>481<br>00:29:12,740 –&gt; 00:29:16,019<br>How do you rewrite this in terms of the thing we’re trying to write?</p>
<p>482<br>00:29:16,019 –&gt; 00:29:17,980<br>There was a solution back there.</p>
<p>483<br>00:29:17,980 –&gt; 00:29:20,460<br>How are the score would occur anywhere?</p>
<p>484<br>00:29:20,460 –&gt; 00:29:20,940<br>Yep.</p>
<p>485<br>00:29:20,940 –&gt; 00:29:21,860<br>We can do that too.</p>
<p>486<br>00:29:21,860 –&gt; 00:29:23,060<br>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>487<br>00:29:23,060 –&gt; 00:29:27,900<br>So here we’re assuming that we don’t know the star star operator.</p>
<p>488<br>00:29:27,900 –&gt; 00:29:31,220<br>Otherwise, this would be a very easy function to write.</p>
<p>489<br>00:29:31,220 –&gt; 00:29:33,940<br>We are trying to define the star star operator ourselves</p>
<p>490<br>00:29:33,940 –&gt; 00:29:37,100<br>using this function in power recur.</p>
<p>491<br>00:29:37,100 –&gt; 00:29:42,060<br>So we’re just going to call it again down here with n and p minus 1.</p>
<p>492<br>00:29:42,059 –&gt; 00:29:44,859<br>So if we run it, this will give us 8.</p>
<p>493<br>00:29:49,659 –&gt; 00:29:49,859<br>Yep.</p>
<p>494<br>00:29:49,859 –&gt; 00:29:50,659<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>495<br>00:29:50,659 –&gt; 00:29:56,139<br>What is the assessment of having the p is 1 of the p?</p>
<p>496<br>00:29:56,139 –&gt; 00:29:56,659<br>Yes.</p>
<p>497<br>00:29:56,659 –&gt; 00:29:57,379<br>Great question.</p>
<p>498<br>00:29:57,379 –&gt; 00:29:58,859<br>What is the necessity of this?</p>
<p>499<br>00:29:58,859 –&gt; 00:30:00,379<br>There is no necessity.</p>
<p>500<br>00:30:00,379 –&gt; 00:30:02,419<br>I actually just included it there to just</p>
<p>501<br>00:30:02,419 –&gt; 00:30:05,379<br>show you how we can have two base cases.</p>
<p>502<br>00:30:05,379 –&gt; 00:30:10,139<br>So in this particular case, we would actually never hit this one.</p>
<p>503<br>00:30:10,140 –&gt; 00:30:15,460<br>n is greater than 1, because we always stop here.</p>
<p>504<br>00:30:15,460 –&gt; 00:30:18,500<br>If the user gives us 0, we would just return that one.</p>
<p>505<br>00:30:18,500 –&gt; 00:30:22,820<br>But it would work if we completely removed that as well.</p>
<p>506<br>00:30:22,820 –&gt; 00:30:23,500<br>Great question.</p>
<p>507<br>00:30:28,700 –&gt; 00:30:32,060<br>OK, let’s look at one more example.</p>
<p>508<br>00:30:32,060 –&gt; 00:30:35,940<br>And this one is the one that I’m going to ask for some participation.</p>
<p>509<br>00:30:35,940 –&gt; 00:30:38,780<br>I would like four of you to come down with me.</p>
<p>510<br>00:30:38,779 –&gt; 00:30:42,899<br>But before we do that, let’s think about factorial.</p>
<p>511<br>00:30:42,899 –&gt; 00:30:48,740<br>So the definition of n factorial is n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 times n minus 3</p>
<p>512<br>00:30:48,740 –&gt; 00:30:50,379<br>down to 1.</p>
<p>513<br>00:30:50,379 –&gt; 00:30:51,619<br>What is a base case?</p>
<p>514<br>00:30:51,619 –&gt; 00:30:54,819<br>What is the simplest thing that we know the factorial of?</p>
<p>515<br>00:30:54,819 –&gt; 00:30:55,619<br>You guys tell me.</p>
<p>516<br>00:30:59,500 –&gt; 00:31:02,700<br>What is 0 factorial?</p>
<p>517<br>00:31:02,700 –&gt; 00:31:03,059<br>1.</p>
<p>518<br>00:31:03,059 –&gt; 00:31:03,779<br>Good.</p>
<p>519<br>00:31:03,779 –&gt; 00:31:04,539<br>I chose 1.</p>
<p>520<br>00:31:04,539 –&gt; 00:31:05,579<br>But both could work.</p>
<p>521<br>00:31:05,579 –&gt; 00:31:07,139<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>522<br>00:31:07,140 –&gt; 00:31:09,580<br>If n is equal to 0, we can also return 1.</p>
<p>523<br>00:31:09,580 –&gt; 00:31:12,900<br>Or we can do n is equal to 1, return 1.</p>
<p>524<br>00:31:12,900 –&gt; 00:31:15,060<br>What’s our recursive step?</p>
<p>525<br>00:31:15,060 –&gt; 00:31:18,500<br>Do you recognize the recursive pattern here?</p>
<p>526<br>00:31:18,500 –&gt; 00:31:29,140<br>And factorial equals n times n minus 1 factorial.</p>
<p>527<br>00:31:29,140 –&gt; 00:31:33,380<br>If we extract the first n out, n minus 1 times n minus 2 times n minus 3.</p>
<p>528<br>00:31:33,380 –&gt; 00:31:36,300<br>And so on is just n minus 1 factorial.</p>
<p>529<br>00:31:36,299 –&gt; 00:31:43,099<br>And so our recursive step just says it’s n times the same function factorial with n minus</p>
<p>530<br>00:31:43,099 –&gt; 00:31:44,099<br>1.</p>
<p>531<br>00:31:44,099 –&gt; 00:31:45,859<br>Does everyone OK with that?</p>
<p>532<br>00:31:45,859 –&gt; 00:31:47,379<br>Cool.</p>
<p>533<br>00:31:47,379 –&gt; 00:31:47,899<br>OK.</p>
<p>534<br>00:31:47,899 –&gt; 00:31:51,940<br>So let’s look through this example with some participation.</p>
<p>535<br>00:31:51,940 –&gt; 00:31:53,539<br>So four people.</p>
<p>536<br>00:31:53,539 –&gt; 00:31:54,539<br>One, yes.</p>
<p>537<br>00:31:54,539 –&gt; 00:31:57,019<br>And you’ll be on OCW forever, you guys, too.</p>
<p>538<br>00:31:57,019 –&gt; 00:31:57,779<br>Yep.</p>
<p>539<br>00:31:57,779 –&gt; 00:32:00,460<br>Two more.</p>
<p>540<br>00:32:00,460 –&gt; 00:32:01,099<br>Yes.</p>
<p>541<br>00:32:01,099 –&gt; 00:32:02,740<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>542<br>00:32:02,740 –&gt; 00:32:03,339<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>543<br>00:32:03,339 –&gt; 00:32:04,299<br>Awesome.</p>
<p>544<br>00:32:04,299 –&gt; 00:32:04,899<br>OK.</p>
<p>545<br>00:32:04,900 –&gt; 00:32:08,900<br>And I’ll have you guys stand right here.</p>
<p>546<br>00:32:08,900 –&gt; 00:32:15,900<br>I’ll ask you guys to come in one at a time as we are working through this exam.</p>
<p>547<br>00:32:15,900 –&gt; 00:32:20,220<br>So we’re just going to demonstrate sort of once again what happens when we make function</p>
<p>548<br>00:32:20,220 –&gt; 00:32:21,220<br>calls.</p>
<p>549<br>00:32:21,220 –&gt; 00:32:23,220<br>You want to just stand right here beside behind my computer.</p>
<p>550<br>00:32:23,220 –&gt; 00:32:24,220<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>551<br>00:32:24,220 –&gt; 00:32:25,220<br>Yep.</p>
<p>552<br>00:32:25,220 –&gt; 00:32:26,220<br>Behind my computer.</p>
<p>553<br>00:32:26,220 –&gt; 00:32:27,220<br>Cool.</p>
<p>554<br>00:32:27,220 –&gt; 00:32:28,220<br>OK.</p>
<p>555<br>00:32:28,220 –&gt; 00:32:29,220<br>Perfect.</p>
<p>556<br>00:32:29,220 –&gt; 00:32:30,220<br>OK.</p>
<p>557<br>00:32:30,220 –&gt; 00:32:34,340<br>So I’ll just stand here.</p>
<p>558<br>00:32:34,339 –&gt; 00:32:37,740<br>So I am going to be the main program.</p>
<p>559<br>00:32:37,740 –&gt; 00:32:40,379<br>I am you run this code.</p>
<p>560<br>00:32:40,379 –&gt; 00:32:43,139<br>I am going to be the main program.</p>
<p>561<br>00:32:43,139 –&gt; 00:32:52,579<br>I am going to keep track of the variables and everything that’s in this global scope.</p>
<p>562<br>00:32:52,579 –&gt; 00:32:53,579<br>OK.</p>
<p>563<br>00:32:53,579 –&gt; 00:32:58,379<br>So in the global scope, just like we have it in the past, I’ve got a definition for my</p>
<p>564<br>00:32:58,379 –&gt; 00:33:01,980<br>factorial function here.</p>
<p>565<br>00:33:01,980 –&gt; 00:33:03,259<br>And this is just some code.</p>
<p>566<br>00:33:03,259 –&gt; 00:33:04,740<br>At this point, I’ve just defined it.</p>
<p>567<br>00:33:04,740 –&gt; 00:33:07,099<br>I don’t care what it actually is.</p>
<p>568<br>00:33:07,099 –&gt; 00:33:08,860<br>But I have one function call.</p>
<p>569<br>00:33:08,860 –&gt; 00:33:12,740<br>So my one and only job is to print the result of factorial four.</p>
<p>570<br>00:33:12,740 –&gt; 00:33:13,740<br>Right.</p>
<p>571<br>00:33:13,740 –&gt; 00:33:15,299<br>I have a pretty easy job.</p>
<p>572<br>00:33:15,299 –&gt; 00:33:16,539<br>So what happens?</p>
<p>573<br>00:33:16,539 –&gt; 00:33:21,380<br>You guys audience tell me what happens when I’ve got factorial four.</p>
<p>574<br>00:33:21,380 –&gt; 00:33:22,980<br>What is this?</p>
<p>575<br>00:33:22,980 –&gt; 00:33:26,259<br>Do I just know right off the bat what factorial four is?</p>
<p>576<br>00:33:26,259 –&gt; 00:33:27,259<br>No.</p>
<p>577<br>00:33:27,259 –&gt; 00:33:29,460<br>It is a function call, right?</p>
<p>578<br>00:33:29,460 –&gt; 00:33:37,299<br>So as a function call, what do I need to do?</p>
<p>579<br>00:33:37,299 –&gt; 00:33:38,299<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>580<br>00:33:38,299 –&gt; 00:33:39,980<br>I need to create an environment.</p>
<p>581<br>00:33:39,980 –&gt; 00:33:43,380<br>So you will be my first environment.</p>
<p>582<br>00:33:43,380 –&gt; 00:33:44,380<br>Hello.</p>
<p>583<br>00:33:44,380 –&gt; 00:33:45,380<br>My name is you can put it on.</p>
<p>584<br>00:33:45,380 –&gt; 00:33:46,380<br>There you go.</p>
<p>585<br>00:33:46,380 –&gt; 00:33:47,380<br>Hello.</p>
<p>586<br>00:33:47,380 –&gt; 00:33:48,380<br>My name is.</p>
<p>587<br>00:33:48,380 –&gt; 00:33:49,380<br>And then you can step right over there.</p>
<p>588<br>00:33:49,380 –&gt; 00:33:50,579<br>So you are my first function call.</p>
<p>589<br>00:33:50,579 –&gt; 00:33:52,620<br>Your name is fact for factorial.</p>
<p>590<br>00:33:52,620 –&gt; 00:33:53,620<br>Awesome.</p>
<p>591<br>00:33:53,620 –&gt; 00:33:58,460<br>So I have just called you.</p>
<p>592<br>00:33:58,460 –&gt; 00:33:59,420<br>What is your job?</p>
<p>593<br>00:33:59,420 –&gt; 00:34:05,500<br>So you guys tell me what is factorial four’s job is from running the code.</p>
<p>594<br>00:34:05,500 –&gt; 00:34:08,260<br>Are they going to do the if or the else?</p>
<p>595<br>00:34:08,260 –&gt; 00:34:08,780<br>The else.</p>
<p>596<br>00:34:08,780 –&gt; 00:34:09,780<br>So this is your job.</p>
<p>597<br>00:34:09,780 –&gt; 00:34:10,619<br>You keep track of that.</p>
<p>598<br>00:34:10,619 –&gt; 00:34:12,460<br>Your end is going to be four.</p>
<p>599<br>00:34:12,460 –&gt; 00:34:15,860<br>And your job is to return four times factorial of three.</p>
<p>600<br>00:34:15,860 –&gt; 00:34:18,700<br>Do you know what factorial of three is right now?</p>
<p>601<br>00:34:18,700 –&gt; 00:34:19,019<br>No.</p>
<p>602<br>00:34:19,019 –&gt; 00:34:21,460<br>So what do you need to do?</p>
<p>603<br>00:34:21,460 –&gt; 00:34:21,860<br>Yes.</p>
<p>604<br>00:34:21,860 –&gt; 00:34:23,139<br>Please call somebody else.</p>
<p>605<br>00:34:23,139 –&gt; 00:34:25,380<br>Who are you going to call?</p>
<p>606<br>00:34:25,380 –&gt; 00:34:26,460<br>Next.</p>
<p>607<br>00:34:26,460 –&gt; 00:34:27,860<br>What is your name going to be?</p>
<p>608<br>00:34:28,860 –&gt; 00:34:31,980<br>Your name is also factorial exactly.</p>
<p>609<br>00:34:31,980 –&gt; 00:34:35,059<br>And you are going to be called with n is equal to three.</p>
<p>610<br>00:34:35,059 –&gt; 00:34:39,539<br>So you can stand right beside factorial of four.</p>
<p>611<br>00:34:39,539 –&gt; 00:34:40,300<br>Very nice.</p>
<p>612<br>00:34:40,300 –&gt; 00:34:47,500<br>So now notice we’ve got two function calls, both of their names are factorial,</p>
<p>613<br>00:34:47,500 –&gt; 00:34:48,700<br>right?</p>
<p>614<br>00:34:48,700 –&gt; 00:34:51,500<br>But they are completely separate function calls.</p>
<p>615<br>00:34:51,500 –&gt; 00:34:53,900<br>They are completely in different environments.</p>
<p>616<br>00:34:53,900 –&gt; 00:34:55,620<br>They have their own end values.</p>
<p>617<br>00:34:55,620 –&gt; 00:34:57,820<br>They have their own jobs to do.</p>
<p>618<br>00:34:58,380 –&gt; 00:35:02,059<br>Just because their name is factorial for both of them</p>
<p>619<br>00:35:02,059 –&gt; 00:35:05,820<br>does not mean that they’ll interfere with each other’s variables, right?</p>
<p>620<br>00:35:05,820 –&gt; 00:35:08,260<br>Very, very important point to make.</p>
<p>621<br>00:35:08,260 –&gt; 00:35:09,460<br>factorial three.</p>
<p>622<br>00:35:09,460 –&gt; 00:35:12,300<br>Do you know what factorial two is?</p>
<p>623<br>00:35:12,300 –&gt; 00:35:12,539<br>No.</p>
<p>624<br>00:35:12,539 –&gt; 00:35:14,420<br>So what do you need to do?</p>
<p>625<br>00:35:14,420 –&gt; 00:35:15,100<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>626<br>00:35:15,100 –&gt; 00:35:15,980<br>Who are you going to call?</p>
<p>627<br>00:35:15,980 –&gt; 00:35:18,019<br>I’m factorial.</p>
<p>628<br>00:35:18,019 –&gt; 00:35:19,100<br>Here you go.</p>
<p>629<br>00:35:19,100 –&gt; 00:35:22,500<br>What is your name going to be?</p>
<p>630<br>00:35:22,500 –&gt; 00:35:25,019<br>factorial at n is equal to two?</p>
<p>631<br>00:35:25,019 –&gt; 00:35:25,900<br>Yes, we are at two.</p>
<p>632<br>00:35:25,900 –&gt; 00:35:26,380<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>633<br>00:35:26,380 –&gt; 00:35:29,740<br>So your name is also factorial.</p>
<p>634<br>00:35:29,740 –&gt; 00:35:32,460<br>And you are going to be with called with n is equal to two.</p>
<p>635<br>00:35:32,460 –&gt; 00:35:36,180<br>Again, now I have three factorial calls.</p>
<p>636<br>00:35:36,180 –&gt; 00:35:40,700<br>They’re all to the name factorial, but they’re all independent function calls.</p>
<p>637<br>00:35:40,700 –&gt; 00:35:43,539<br>So your job is to return two times factorial of one.</p>
<p>638<br>00:35:43,539 –&gt; 00:35:45,700<br>Do you know what factorial of one is?</p>
<p>639<br>00:35:45,700 –&gt; 00:35:46,700<br>Yes.</p>
<p>640<br>00:35:46,700 –&gt; 00:35:48,700<br>Wait.</p>
<p>641<br>00:35:48,700 –&gt; 00:35:50,420<br>As a human you do.</p>
<p>642<br>00:35:50,420 –&gt; 00:35:52,500<br>But as factorial you do not.</p>
<p>643<br>00:35:52,500 –&gt; 00:35:53,820<br>What do you need to do?</p>
<p>644<br>00:35:53,820 –&gt; 00:35:55,019<br>Oh, call her.</p>
<p>645<br>00:35:55,019 –&gt; 00:35:55,900<br>Call her exactly.</p>
<p>646<br>00:35:55,900 –&gt; 00:35:56,659<br>Here you go.</p>
<p>647<br>00:35:56,659 –&gt; 00:35:58,619<br>Your name is also factorial.</p>
<p>648<br>00:35:58,619 –&gt; 00:36:01,340<br>You can stand beside our lovely other factorials.</p>
<p>649<br>00:36:01,340 –&gt; 00:36:04,820<br>So your job, audience, I’ve already given away.</p>
<p>650<br>00:36:04,820 –&gt; 00:36:10,539<br>Your last job is to return one.</p>
<p>651<br>00:36:10,539 –&gt; 00:36:11,900<br>OK, excellent.</p>
<p>652<br>00:36:11,900 –&gt; 00:36:14,980<br>So here is your return value.</p>
<p>653<br>00:36:14,980 –&gt; 00:36:18,340<br>Now, factorial of one.</p>
<p>654<br>00:36:18,340 –&gt; 00:36:21,980<br>Are you going to return that value to me?</p>
<p>655<br>00:36:21,980 –&gt; 00:36:24,219<br>Which one will you return it to?</p>
<p>656<br>00:36:24,219 –&gt; 00:36:25,219<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>657<br>00:36:25,219 –&gt; 00:36:27,539<br>So factorial with n is equal to two can now</p>
<p>658<br>00:36:27,539 –&gt; 00:36:31,179<br>replace their factorial one function with one.</p>
<p>659<br>00:36:31,179 –&gt; 00:36:35,259<br>So what is your return value going to be factorial of two?</p>
<p>660<br>00:36:35,259 –&gt; 00:36:36,259<br>I got it right.</p>
<p>661<br>00:36:36,259 –&gt; 00:36:37,459<br>Two, exactly.</p>
<p>662<br>00:36:37,459 –&gt; 00:36:40,099<br>So where do you pass your value along to?</p>
<p>663<br>00:36:40,099 –&gt; 00:36:42,379<br>OK, now one thing we forgot.</p>
<p>664<br>00:36:42,379 –&gt; 00:36:47,019<br>As soon as you made the return value, you disappear.</p>
<p>665<br>00:36:47,019 –&gt; 00:36:48,500<br>You had a very simple job.</p>
<p>666<br>00:36:48,500 –&gt; 00:36:50,299<br>I’m sorry, but it was really important.</p>
<p>667<br>00:36:50,299 –&gt; 00:36:51,339<br>You were our base case.</p>
<p>668<br>00:36:51,340 –&gt; 00:36:55,180<br>Without you, we would have had infinite recursion.</p>
<p>669<br>00:36:55,180 –&gt; 00:36:57,700<br>OK, so you’ve passed along your value.</p>
<p>670<br>00:36:57,700 –&gt; 00:37:00,780<br>So as a function that’s done its job, what do you do?</p>
<p>671<br>00:37:00,780 –&gt; 00:37:01,300<br>Disappear.</p>
<p>672<br>00:37:01,300 –&gt; 00:37:01,860<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>673<br>00:37:01,860 –&gt; 00:37:02,620<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>674<br>00:37:02,620 –&gt; 00:37:04,740<br>All right, factorial of where are we?</p>
<p>675<br>00:37:04,740 –&gt; 00:37:05,940<br>Three, exactly.</p>
<p>676<br>00:37:05,940 –&gt; 00:37:08,500<br>What is your value going to be now?</p>
<p>677<br>00:37:08,500 –&gt; 00:37:09,380<br>Six, exactly.</p>
<p>678<br>00:37:09,380 –&gt; 00:37:11,380<br>So here’s your return value.</p>
<p>679<br>00:37:11,380 –&gt; 00:37:12,260<br>You give it to me.</p>
<p>680<br>00:37:12,260 –&gt; 00:37:12,980<br>There you go.</p>
<p>681<br>00:37:12,980 –&gt; 00:37:15,820<br>And as, exactly, very good.</p>
<p>682<br>00:37:15,820 –&gt; 00:37:16,500<br>We disappear.</p>
<p>683<br>00:37:16,500 –&gt; 00:37:18,579<br>So we’ve got three function calls that disappear</p>
<p>684<br>00:37:18,579 –&gt; 00:37:20,460<br>as soon as they return to value.</p>
<p>685<br>00:37:20,460 –&gt; 00:37:23,699<br>And finally, four times six, 24.</p>
<p>686<br>00:37:23,699 –&gt; 00:37:26,139<br>And who do you give your value?</p>
<p>687<br>00:37:26,139 –&gt; 00:37:27,340<br>I mean, which I just gave you.</p>
<p>688<br>00:37:27,340 –&gt; 00:37:28,900<br>Sorry, yeah, that was confusing.</p>
<p>689<br>00:37:28,900 –&gt; 00:37:31,019<br>Thank you so much, you guys.</p>
<p>690<br>00:37:31,019 –&gt; 00:37:36,579<br>That illustrated a couple of things you guys can head back.</p>
<p>691<br>00:37:36,579 –&gt; 00:37:37,539<br>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>692<br>00:37:37,539 –&gt; 00:37:39,179<br>APPLAUSE</p>
<p>693<br>00:37:42,219 –&gt; 00:37:44,460<br>So we illustrated a couple of things here.</p>
<p>694<br>00:37:44,460 –&gt; 00:37:47,099<br>I’m going to do it on the slides as well.</p>
<p>695<br>00:37:47,099 –&gt; 00:37:49,940<br>Just to bring the point home.</p>
<p>696<br>00:37:49,940 –&gt; 00:37:51,900<br>But let’s go through it.</p>
<p>697<br>00:37:51,900 –&gt; 00:37:54,059<br>So I’ve got factorial four.</p>
<p>698<br>00:37:54,059 –&gt; 00:37:57,139<br>Every time I make a function call, even though it’s</p>
<p>699<br>00:37:57,139 –&gt; 00:38:00,900<br>the same name, all factorial, it’s a completely separate</p>
<p>700<br>00:38:00,900 –&gt; 00:38:02,539<br>environment.</p>
<p>701<br>00:38:02,539 –&gt; 00:38:05,019<br>Happens to have the same name, but they’re just in charge</p>
<p>702<br>00:38:05,019 –&gt; 00:38:06,659<br>of doing their own job.</p>
<p>703<br>00:38:06,659 –&gt; 00:38:11,779<br>So here I’ve got factorial four calling four times factorial</p>
<p>704<br>00:38:11,779 –&gt; 00:38:13,139<br>of three.</p>
<p>705<br>00:38:13,139 –&gt; 00:38:15,739<br>As soon as I see factorial of three, this creates another</p>
<p>706<br>00:38:15,739 –&gt; 00:38:17,099<br>environment.</p>
<p>707<br>00:38:17,099 –&gt; 00:38:21,099<br>This is going to be returning three times factorial of two.</p>
<p>708<br>00:38:21,099 –&gt; 00:38:22,819<br>Again, another environment.</p>
<p>709<br>00:38:22,819 –&gt; 00:38:25,899<br>This returns two times factorial of one</p>
<p>710<br>00:38:25,899 –&gt; 00:38:27,579<br>and a final environment, right?</p>
<p>711<br>00:38:27,579 –&gt; 00:38:31,259<br>Our most important environment is</p>
<p>712<br>00:38:31,259 –&gt; 00:38:32,899<br>that last one with the base case.</p>
<p>713<br>00:38:32,899 –&gt; 00:38:36,500<br>It allows us to kickstart our conquer step.</p>
<p>714<br>00:38:36,500 –&gt; 00:38:40,859<br>So this base step will return the value one to whoever called it.</p>
<p>715<br>00:38:40,859 –&gt; 00:38:43,619<br>Again, we’re not skipping around.</p>
<p>716<br>00:38:43,619 –&gt; 00:38:47,259<br>We only return the value to the function that called us.</p>
<p>717<br>00:38:47,259 –&gt; 00:38:49,859<br>And I know it gets really confusing because everything</p>
<p>718<br>00:38:49,859 –&gt; 00:38:52,339<br>is called fact in this particular case.</p>
<p>719<br>00:38:52,339 –&gt; 00:38:56,299<br>But we just have to remember which function called us.</p>
<p>720<br>00:38:56,299 –&gt; 00:38:59,219<br>And so we return the one back up here.</p>
<p>721<br>00:38:59,219 –&gt; 00:39:01,099<br>This becomes two times one.</p>
<p>722<br>00:39:01,099 –&gt; 00:39:03,420<br>And they can finish their job, right?</p>
<p>723<br>00:39:03,420 –&gt; 00:39:06,659<br>So notice at this point, we were one, two, three, four</p>
<p>724<br>00:39:06,659 –&gt; 00:39:09,659<br>functions just kind of hung up and waiting for values</p>
<p>725<br>00:39:09,659 –&gt; 00:39:11,219<br>to be passed back to us.</p>
<p>726<br>00:39:11,219 –&gt; 00:39:14,299<br>But now we can finally finish our jobs one by one.</p>
<p>727<br>00:39:14,299 –&gt; 00:39:16,419<br>So this one returns a two.</p>
<p>728<br>00:39:16,419 –&gt; 00:39:18,299<br>This one returns the six.</p>
<p>729<br>00:39:18,299 –&gt; 00:39:22,379<br>This one returns the 24.</p>
<p>730<br>00:39:22,379 –&gt; 00:39:26,379<br>And the 24 gets printed out.</p>
<p>731<br>00:39:26,379 –&gt; 00:39:30,819<br>So big idea here.</p>
<p>732<br>00:39:30,819 –&gt; 00:39:33,099<br>We’ve got each function called, even though it</p>
<p>733<br>00:39:33,099 –&gt; 00:39:36,059<br>has the same name, is completely separate, right?</p>
<p>734<br>00:39:36,059 –&gt; 00:39:41,179<br>Completely independent environment with their own parameters.</p>
<p>735<br>00:39:41,500 –&gt; 00:39:45,019<br>Those parameters can change within those environments.</p>
<p>736<br>00:39:45,019 –&gt; 00:39:46,059<br>And that’s totally OK.</p>
<p>737<br>00:39:46,059 –&gt; 00:39:48,379<br>They won’t interfere with any parameters</p>
<p>738<br>00:39:48,379 –&gt; 00:39:49,899<br>in any other environments.</p>
<p>739<br>00:39:54,339 –&gt; 00:39:57,739<br>So let’s do the Python tutor link.</p>
<p>740<br>00:39:57,739 –&gt; 00:40:00,019<br>And then again, we can just do one more time</p>
<p>741<br>00:40:00,019 –&gt; 00:40:02,019<br>just to show you what this looks like in terms</p>
<p>742<br>00:40:02,019 –&gt; 00:40:03,299<br>of the Python tutor.</p>
<p>743<br>00:40:03,299 –&gt; 00:40:06,819<br>So here I’ve got my factorial with n is equal to 4.</p>
<p>744<br>00:40:06,819 –&gt; 00:40:08,859<br>Calls n is equal to 3.</p>
<p>745<br>00:40:08,860 –&gt; 00:40:11,460<br>Calls factorial with n is equal to 2.</p>
<p>746<br>00:40:11,460 –&gt; 00:40:13,980<br>Calls factorial with n is equal to 1.</p>
<p>747<br>00:40:13,980 –&gt; 00:40:16,940<br>At this point, just like with the multiplication,</p>
<p>748<br>00:40:16,940 –&gt; 00:40:19,780<br>I’ve got all these factorials in the works.</p>
<p>749<br>00:40:19,780 –&gt; 00:40:22,220<br>But we can start returning values back to whoever</p>
<p>750<br>00:40:22,220 –&gt; 00:40:27,099<br>called us until we get back to the original function call.</p>
<p>751<br>00:40:30,260 –&gt; 00:40:32,900<br>So this is another recap of the observations</p>
<p>752<br>00:40:32,900 –&gt; 00:40:35,220<br>that we’ve seen right each different function call</p>
<p>753<br>00:40:35,220 –&gt; 00:40:37,260<br>has its own environment.</p>
<p>754<br>00:40:37,260 –&gt; 00:40:39,180<br>The variables within these environments</p>
<p>755<br>00:40:39,180 –&gt; 00:40:41,340<br>are specific to those environments.</p>
<p>756<br>00:40:41,340 –&gt; 00:40:44,340<br>They don’t interfere with each other.</p>
<p>757<br>00:40:44,340 –&gt; 00:40:48,620<br>And the flow of control, so when we make a function call,</p>
<p>758<br>00:40:48,620 –&gt; 00:40:51,860<br>all we know is the function that we call next.</p>
<p>759<br>00:40:51,860 –&gt; 00:40:53,140<br>We don’t skip around.</p>
<p>760<br>00:40:53,140 –&gt; 00:40:55,900<br>All we know is who we call next and who we need</p>
<p>761<br>00:40:55,900 –&gt; 00:40:57,300<br>to give the value back up to.</p>
<p>762<br>00:41:01,740 –&gt; 00:41:03,260<br>One last thing I wanted to point out.</p>
<p>763<br>00:41:03,260 –&gt; 00:41:08,020<br>So here I’ve got the code for factorial, the iterative</p>
<p>764<br>00:41:08,020 –&gt; 00:41:11,820<br>version, and the recursive version.</p>
<p>765<br>00:41:11,820 –&gt; 00:41:14,500<br>So the one on the left is, or sorry, the one on the right</p>
<p>766<br>00:41:14,500 –&gt; 00:41:15,980<br>is what we already wrote.</p>
<p>767<br>00:41:15,980 –&gt; 00:41:18,260<br>So it’s factorial recursive.</p>
<p>768<br>00:41:18,260 –&gt; 00:41:20,540<br>And the one on the left is the iterative version.</p>
<p>769<br>00:41:20,540 –&gt; 00:41:25,900<br>So I personally think the one on the right</p>
<p>770<br>00:41:25,900 –&gt; 00:41:29,980<br>is more readable, because it’s very similar to the way</p>
<p>771<br>00:41:29,980 –&gt; 00:41:33,659<br>that we would write the expression mathematically.</p>
<p>772<br>00:41:33,659 –&gt; 00:41:37,179<br>But if you had a little bit of time to think about it,</p>
<p>773<br>00:41:37,179 –&gt; 00:41:39,900<br>you can just as easily come up with code that does</p>
<p>774<br>00:41:39,900 –&gt; 00:41:42,300<br>the exact same job iteratively.</p>
<p>775<br>00:41:42,300 –&gt; 00:41:44,860<br>So remember, in iteration, we’ve got our loop.</p>
<p>776<br>00:41:44,860 –&gt; 00:41:47,860<br>There’s no other function calls.</p>
<p>777<br>00:41:47,860 –&gt; 00:41:51,099<br>We have a loop that iterates some number of times.</p>
<p>778<br>00:41:51,099 –&gt; 00:41:53,699<br>There’s some sort of loop variable or loop counter.</p>
<p>779<br>00:41:53,699 –&gt; 00:41:56,619<br>And there is a state variable that keeps track of the answer</p>
<p>780<br>00:41:56,619 –&gt; 00:41:57,139<br>of interest.</p>
<p>781<br>00:41:57,139 –&gt; 00:42:00,379<br>In this particular case, the product from one all the way up</p>
<p>782<br>00:42:00,379 –&gt; 00:42:03,139<br>to and including it.</p>
<p>783<br>00:42:03,139 –&gt; 00:42:06,099<br>So I want to end today’s lecture with just a couple</p>
<p>784<br>00:42:06,099 –&gt; 00:42:07,179<br>of observations.</p>
<p>785<br>00:42:07,179 –&gt; 00:42:11,460<br>So today we saw some really simple examples of recursion.</p>
<p>786<br>00:42:11,460 –&gt; 00:42:15,259<br>But I think it outlined some really, really tricky ideas</p>
<p>787<br>00:42:15,259 –&gt; 00:42:18,579<br>that people usually have trouble grasping</p>
<p>788<br>00:42:18,579 –&gt; 00:42:19,699<br>when you first see recursion.</p>
<p>789<br>00:42:19,699 –&gt; 00:42:22,059<br>And that’s because you basically write a function</p>
<p>790<br>00:42:22,059 –&gt; 00:42:23,420<br>in terms of itself.</p>
<p>791<br>00:42:23,420 –&gt; 00:42:25,539<br>And that can be a little bit confusing.</p>
<p>792<br>00:42:25,539 –&gt; 00:42:28,219<br>So of course, we applied recursion to some really, really</p>
<p>793<br>00:42:28,219 –&gt; 00:42:29,380<br>simple things.</p>
<p>794<br>00:42:29,380 –&gt; 00:42:32,139<br>We did multiplication.</p>
<p>795<br>00:42:32,139 –&gt; 00:42:33,340<br>And we did factorial.</p>
<p>796<br>00:42:35,860 –&gt; 00:42:38,500<br>Depending on how you feel, the recursive version</p>
<p>797<br>00:42:38,500 –&gt; 00:42:40,539<br>or the iterative version might be more intuitive for you.</p>
<p>798<br>00:42:40,539 –&gt; 00:42:42,380<br>And certainly, for these examples,</p>
<p>799<br>00:42:42,380 –&gt; 00:42:46,460<br>you did not need to write them recursively.</p>
<p>800<br>00:42:46,460 –&gt; 00:42:47,820<br>There’s a lot of code out there</p>
<p>801<br>00:42:47,820 –&gt; 00:42:50,659<br>that you actually don’t need to implement recursively.</p>
<p>802<br>00:42:50,659 –&gt; 00:42:53,179<br>The iterative solution is far more intuitive,</p>
<p>803<br>00:42:53,179 –&gt; 00:42:56,539<br>especially since you guys were first introduced to iteration.</p>
<p>804<br>00:42:56,539 –&gt; 00:42:57,899<br>You introduced for loops in a while,</p>
<p>805<br>00:42:57,899 –&gt; 00:43:01,099<br>loops back in lecture, like three or something like that.</p>
<p>806<br>00:43:01,099 –&gt; 00:43:03,299<br>So if that’s the first thing you saw,</p>
<p>807<br>00:43:03,299 –&gt; 00:43:05,099<br>that’s usually the first thing that’s</p>
<p>808<br>00:43:05,099 –&gt; 00:43:05,899<br>going to be your go-to.</p>
<p>809<br>00:43:05,899 –&gt; 00:43:08,059<br>But there are several problems that</p>
<p>810<br>00:43:08,059 –&gt; 00:43:11,460<br>are more intuitive to write using recursion.</p>
<p>811<br>00:43:11,460 –&gt; 00:43:14,940<br>So a couple of examples where recursion is more intuitive</p>
<p>812<br>00:43:14,940 –&gt; 00:43:19,299<br>is any time when you need to repeat a task that, for which</p>
<p>813<br>00:43:19,299 –&gt; 00:43:23,019<br>you don’t know how deep you need to go.</p>
<p>814<br>00:43:23,019 –&gt; 00:43:24,980<br>In which case, the recursive calls</p>
<p>815<br>00:43:24,980 –&gt; 00:43:27,619<br>will take care of making calls to itself,</p>
<p>816<br>00:43:27,619 –&gt; 00:43:28,940<br>to itself, to itself, to itself,</p>
<p>817<br>00:43:28,940 –&gt; 00:43:30,259<br>until it reaches the base case.</p>
<p>818<br>00:43:30,259 –&gt; 00:43:33,219<br>You don’t need to think about that in your iteration.</p>
<p>819<br>00:43:33,219 –&gt; 00:43:36,179<br>So an example of that is this classic one</p>
<p>820<br>00:43:36,179 –&gt; 00:43:40,099<br>where we have a file inside a file system.</p>
<p>821<br>00:43:40,099 –&gt; 00:43:43,780<br>Someone, if we’re looking for a piece at .text,</p>
<p>822<br>00:43:43,780 –&gt; 00:43:47,500<br>we can have a student whose piece at .text</p>
<p>823<br>00:43:47,500 –&gt; 00:43:52,460<br>is straight under their users slash piece at .text folder.</p>
<p>824<br>00:43:52,460 –&gt; 00:43:55,740<br>But we might have another person whose piece at .text</p>
<p>825<br>00:43:55,740 –&gt; 00:43:58,380<br>is going to be within their users or documents,</p>
<p>826<br>00:43:58,380 –&gt; 00:44:01,980<br>their schools, their MIT, their classes, their 600L,</p>
<p>827<br>00:44:01,980 –&gt; 00:44:06,220<br>their piece at one slash piece at .text.</p>
<p>828<br>00:44:06,220 –&gt; 00:44:08,579<br>So that uncertainty for how far deep</p>
<p>829<br>00:44:08,579 –&gt; 00:44:10,500<br>you need to search the file system</p>
<p>830<br>00:44:10,500 –&gt; 00:44:12,260<br>in order to get to the file of interest</p>
<p>831<br>00:44:12,260 –&gt; 00:44:14,940<br>is a perfect place to apply recursion.</p>
<p>832<br>00:44:14,940 –&gt; 00:44:17,539<br>Another one is where you have an expression.</p>
<p>833<br>00:44:17,539 –&gt; 00:44:19,619<br>If you’re building your own calculator in code,</p>
<p>834<br>00:44:19,619 –&gt; 00:44:21,579<br>and you have order of expressions.</p>
<p>835<br>00:44:21,579 –&gt; 00:44:25,139<br>Sorry, order of operations using parentheses.</p>
<p>836<br>00:44:25,139 –&gt; 00:44:27,179<br>Again, you don’t know how many parentheses</p>
<p>837<br>00:44:27,179 –&gt; 00:44:30,099<br>you might need to have a loop go through in order</p>
<p>838<br>00:44:30,099 –&gt; 00:44:32,539<br>to get to that base expression, right,</p>
<p>839<br>00:44:32,539 –&gt; 00:44:34,980<br>to figure out the one that you need to do first.</p>
<p>840<br>00:44:34,980 –&gt; 00:44:39,940<br>And so that’s another case where using recursion</p>
<p>841<br>00:44:39,940 –&gt; 00:44:42,420<br>is very useful.</p>
<p>842<br>00:44:42,420 –&gt; 00:44:44,340<br>So in the next lecture, what we’re</p>
<p>843<br>00:44:44,340 –&gt; 00:44:46,420<br>going to do is a recap of recursion</p>
<p>844<br>00:44:46,420 –&gt; 00:44:49,739<br>using another example, Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>845<br>00:44:49,739 –&gt; 00:44:51,500<br>And then we’re going to start looking</p>
<p>846<br>00:44:51,500 –&gt; 00:44:55,259<br>at recursion applied to lists.</p>
<p>847<br>00:44:55,259 –&gt; 00:44:58,259<br>And specifically, if we have lists within lists,</p>
<p>848<br>00:44:58,259 –&gt; 00:44:59,819<br>within lists, within lists.</p>
<p>849<br>00:44:59,819 –&gt; 00:45:03,379<br>And we don’t know how many nested lists we might have,</p>
<p>850<br>00:45:03,379 –&gt; 00:45:05,979<br>recursion’s going to be a perfect example for that.</p>
<p>851<br>00:45:05,979 –&gt; 00:45:06,979<br>OK.</p>
