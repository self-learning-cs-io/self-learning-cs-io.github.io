                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:19,080<br>Let’s get started, everybody.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:19,080 –&gt; 00:00:23,879<br>So last lecture we began talking about this topic of recursion.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:23,879 –&gt; 00:00:30,719<br>And it hopefully solidified a few sort of really fundamental ideas about recursion that</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:30,719 –&gt; 00:00:33,879<br>we’re going to use in today’s lecture.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:33,879 –&gt; 00:00:40,640<br>Today’s lecture, the first half of it ish, we’re going to talk about recursion just kind</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:40,640 –&gt; 00:00:44,120<br>of to review on some actual numerical examples.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:44,120 –&gt; 00:00:48,340<br>But then the second half, which is the main event for today, is going to be recursion on</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:48,340 –&gt; 00:00:49,340<br>non-numeric.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:49,340 –&gt; 00:00:51,920<br>So specifically recursion on lists.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:51,920 –&gt; 00:00:56,400<br>The techniques we’ll see on lists can be applied to other things that are non-numeric</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:56,400 –&gt; 00:00:59,960<br>as well, like two pulls or strings or things like that.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,960 –&gt; 00:01:04,799<br>So let’s start the review of a little bit of review of what we talked about last time</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:04,799 –&gt; 00:01:07,400<br>and some of the big ideas by looking at this example.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:07,400 –&gt; 00:01:11,879<br>So we’re going to write a recursive function for the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:11,879 –&gt; 00:01:16,480<br>And the Fibonacci sequence exists in nature in a lot of places.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:16,480 –&gt; 00:01:24,760<br>One specific place is you can model a mating of rabbits using Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:24,760 –&gt; 00:01:26,480<br>But we won’t be setting that in depth today.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:26,480 –&gt; 00:01:28,640<br>We’re just going to be looking at the sequence itself.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,640 –&gt; 00:01:35,320<br>So just to remind you, the idea behind Fibonacci is we start out with two sort of basic values.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:35,320 –&gt; 00:01:38,960<br>Fibonacci of one is one and Fibonacci of two is one.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:38,960 –&gt; 00:01:42,560<br>So in my table here, I’ve got these two starting values.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:42,560 –&gt; 00:01:47,400<br>And we can fill in the remainder of the table by basically saying Fibonacci of n is Fibonacci</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:47,400 –&gt; 00:01:50,680<br>of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n minus 2.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:50,680 –&gt; 00:01:52,920<br>So Fibonacci of three will be 1 plus 1.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:52,920 –&gt; 00:01:55,120<br>Fibonacci of four will be 2 plus 1.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:55,120 –&gt; 00:01:56,920<br>Fibonacci of five is 3 plus 2.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:56,920 –&gt; 00:01:59,000<br>Fibonacci of six is 5 plus 3.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:59,000 –&gt; 00:02:01,200<br>And Fibonacci of seven is 8 plus 5.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:01,200 –&gt; 00:02:05,359<br>That’s the sequence we all know and love.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:05,359 –&gt; 00:02:09,960<br>Okay, so our two base cases, if we’re going to put this in sort of mathematical terms,</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:09,960 –&gt; 00:02:11,680<br>our Fibonacci of one is one.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:11,680 –&gt; 00:02:13,920<br>Fibonacci of two is one.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:13,920 –&gt; 00:02:20,240<br>And our recursive step, in terms of the math and slash programming,</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:20,240 –&gt; 00:02:26,960<br>Lingo is going to be the Fibonacci of n is equal to Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n minus 2.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:26,960 –&gt; 00:02:29,240<br>So we put that in our function.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:29,240 –&gt; 00:02:35,280<br>So we slap a definition around that code and turn it into a nice function that we can run.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:35,280 –&gt; 00:02:38,680<br>If x is 1 or x is 2, those are our two base cases.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:38,680 –&gt; 00:02:41,000<br>We just return 1 right off the bat.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:41,000 –&gt; 00:02:43,400<br>Nothing to call, no functions to call.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:43,400 –&gt; 00:02:44,840<br>There are base cases.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:44,840 –&gt; 00:02:48,719<br>But otherwise, we’re going to return a value.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:48,719 –&gt; 00:02:54,520<br>And the thing we’re going to return is it call to Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n minus 2.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:54,520 –&gt; 00:02:58,159<br>Just like the mathematical definition said to do.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:58,159 –&gt; 00:03:01,400<br>Okay, so this is different than what we saw last lecture,</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:01,400 –&gt; 00:03:03,200<br>last lecture in our recursive step.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:03,200 –&gt; 00:03:06,840<br>We had basically just one function called to ourselves.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:06,840 –&gt; 00:03:13,560<br>So whatever function we had to find up here, we only had return some variation of that function down here</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:13,560 –&gt; 00:03:18,400<br>with something else tacked onto it, like an addition of some value or something else.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:18,400 –&gt; 00:03:22,800<br>In this case, we actually have the function being called twice.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:22,800 –&gt; 00:03:29,280<br>Okay, so we’re going to see what implications this has as we trace through the code.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:29,280 –&gt; 00:03:35,960<br>And so as I trace through the code, I’ll remind you of some of the big ideas that we learned last lecture.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:35,960 –&gt; 00:03:39,760<br>So let’s say that we wanted to calculate Fibonacci of 6.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:39,760 –&gt; 00:03:48,120<br>And so I’m going to illustrate a function call just by the name of the function with the parameter that I’m calling.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:48,120 –&gt; 00:03:55,719<br>So one of the big ideas from last lecture was that when you make a function call to a function that’s recursive,</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:55,719 –&gt; 00:04:01,480<br>you’re going to trace through that function call and then environment for that function just as you normally would.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:01,479 –&gt; 00:04:07,719<br>But as soon as you see another function call, so in this case, Fibonacci of 6 doesn’t enter the base cases,</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:07,719 –&gt; 00:04:10,639<br>it goes up into the recursive step.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:10,639 –&gt; 00:04:16,959<br>And it says, I’m going to calculate Fibonacci of x minus 1 plus Fibonacci of x minus 2.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:16,959 –&gt; 00:04:23,639<br>So for this Fibonacci of 6 function call, let’s follow along and say, well, Fibonacci of 6,</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:23,639 –&gt; 00:04:29,800<br>we’ll say, I want to calculate Fibonacci of 5.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:29,800 –&gt; 00:04:39,000<br>Is it, this is my question to you, is it going to now calculate Fibonacci of 4?</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:39,000 –&gt; 00:04:41,400<br>No, very good.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:41,400 –&gt; 00:04:45,400<br>Because Fibonacci of 5 is a function call, right?</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:45,400 –&gt; 00:04:52,120<br>We need to explore what this function will return before Fibonacci of 6 can add the result of this,</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:52,120 –&gt; 00:04:56,000<br>the return of this to Fibonacci of 4.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:56,000 –&gt; 00:05:04,000<br>So that means that this new Fib 5 is an entirely new environment calling Fibonacci with n is equal to 5,</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:04,000 –&gt; 00:05:07,360<br>completely separate than our original Fibonacci of 6 call.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:07,360 –&gt; 00:05:09,839<br>So let’s explore what Fibonacci of 5 is going to do.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:09,839 –&gt; 00:05:13,800<br>Well, in its function call, it’s going to again go in the recursive step.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:13,800 –&gt; 00:05:16,759<br>It’s going to figure out Fibonacci of 4.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:16,759 –&gt; 00:05:18,199<br>And then it’s going to pause there, right?</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:18,199 –&gt; 00:05:22,439<br>Because it needs to figure out what Fibonacci of 4 is before it finishes its other half, right?</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:22,439 –&gt; 00:05:25,079<br>To do Fibonacci of 3.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:25,079 –&gt; 00:05:27,680<br>So Fibonacci of 4 will now create a new environment.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:27,680 –&gt; 00:05:30,199<br>And now it has to explore its result of return.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:30,199 –&gt; 00:05:37,240<br>So it figures out Fibonacci of 4 is again going into the recursive step to calculate Fibonacci of 3 plus something.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:37,240 –&gt; 00:05:42,319<br>But we don’t know what that something is yet, because we have to explore what Fibonacci of 3 is, right?</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:42,319 –&gt; 00:05:46,399<br>So already where 4 function calls deep and we haven’t really done any work,</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:46,399 –&gt; 00:05:49,399<br>and any work that we can see the result of, right?</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:49,399 –&gt; 00:05:51,680<br>There’s no values being passed back.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:51,680 –&gt; 00:05:58,800<br>All we’re doing is exploring this path down until we get to some sort of base case that will kick off our,</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:58,800 –&gt; 00:06:02,879<br>our sort of conquer step where we pass values back up the chain.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:04,079 –&gt; 00:06:08,319<br>So Fibonacci of 3 again is going to look at Fibonacci of 2.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:08,319 –&gt; 00:06:13,040<br>And finally, we’ve reached a base case.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:13,040 –&gt; 00:06:15,680<br>So Fibonacci of 2 will immediately return, right?</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:15,680 –&gt; 00:06:17,600<br>It doesn’t make another function call.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:17,600 –&gt; 00:06:19,920<br>So Fibonacci of 2 will return a value.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:19,920 –&gt; 00:06:27,920<br>And then Fibonacci of 3 in its function call has the result for Fibonacci of 2.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:27,920 –&gt; 00:06:32,759<br>And then it’s going to do plus that value plus Fibonacci of 1, right?</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:32,759 –&gt; 00:06:33,920<br>Three minus 2.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:33,920 –&gt; 00:06:35,400<br>So that’s this one here.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:35,400 –&gt; 00:06:42,520<br>It can easily grab the, do that addition and return the value back up to Fibonacci of 3.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:42,520 –&gt; 00:06:49,879<br>So now Fibonacci of 3 has its first half ready, right?</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:49,920 –&gt; 00:06:56,600<br>So Fibonacci of 4, sorry, so Fibonacci of 4 has its first half ready, Fibonacci of 3.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:56,600 –&gt; 00:07:01,719<br>So Fibonacci of 4 was trying to figure out what Fib 3 was and it did, right?</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:01,719 –&gt; 00:07:03,839<br>It was Fib 2 plus Fib 1, too.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:03,839 –&gt; 00:07:12,600<br>So now it has a value for its first half here and it needs to add that value to Fibonacci of 2, 4 minus 2.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:12,600 –&gt; 00:07:16,360<br>So it will explore that path, that’s a base case.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:16,360 –&gt; 00:07:23,319<br>So all it does is return the value immediately and now Fibonacci of 4 has its value, whatever Fib 3 was,</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:23,319 –&gt; 00:07:25,360<br>that we figured out plus Fib 2.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:25,360 –&gt; 00:07:32,240<br>Okay. Now Fib 4, we have a value for it when we called Fib 5.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:32,240 –&gt; 00:07:37,439<br>So Fib 5 is now halfway happy because it knows what Fib 4 is.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:37,439 –&gt; 00:07:41,040<br>But it needs to add that to Fib 3.</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:41,040 –&gt; 00:07:44,639<br>So Fib 5 is still halted, right?</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:44,639 –&gt; 00:07:48,919<br>It can’t return anything because it now it needs to explore what Fib 3 is.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:48,919 –&gt; 00:07:53,039<br>Well, Fib 3 is going to be,</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:55,199 –&gt; 00:07:57,199<br>do another function call, right?</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:57,199 –&gt; 00:08:01,599<br>So it’s going to call Fib 2 and Fib 1, which are two base cases,</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:01,599 –&gt; 00:08:04,319<br>which easily return the value back up to Fib 3.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:04,319 –&gt; 00:08:09,399<br>And now Fib 5 is happy because it knows this value and now it knows this value.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:09,399 –&gt; 00:08:14,599<br>It can add them together and Fib 5 now has a value that it can keep track of.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:14,640 –&gt; 00:08:18,400<br>And now finally, Fib 6, we’re not even close to being done.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:18,400 –&gt; 00:08:24,960<br>You guys, Fib 6 has a Fib 5 value, so it has half of the things it needs to figure out what Fib 6 is.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:24,960 –&gt; 00:08:27,879<br>Because now it has to figure out what Fib 4 is.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:27,879 –&gt; 00:08:30,280<br>And already you can tell what we’re going to do next.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:30,280 –&gt; 00:08:33,879<br>We’re going to start exploring the exact same way like we did before.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:33,879 –&gt; 00:08:36,200<br>Fib 4 needs to calculate Fib 3.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:36,200 –&gt; 00:08:40,920<br>It can’t do Fib 2 yet because Fib 3 needs to calculate Fib 2 and Fib 1, right?</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:40,919 –&gt; 00:08:42,559<br>Pass back up the value.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:42,559 –&gt; 00:08:46,919<br>Fib 4 can now finish its job by calculating Fib 3 and Fib 2.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:46,919 –&gt; 00:08:48,199<br>Pass up the value.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:48,199 –&gt; 00:08:51,719<br>And now finally, Fib 6 has its two halves here.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:51,719 –&gt; 00:08:56,240<br>Fib 5 and Fib 4, and it can add them together and return the value.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:56,240 –&gt; 00:08:57,279<br>OK.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:57,279 –&gt; 00:09:04,599<br>So a super inefficient algorithm, because there’s a lot of sort of stuff going on,</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:04,599 –&gt; 00:09:08,039<br>but not much work being done until the end, right?</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:08,039 –&gt; 00:09:10,199<br>We’ve got a bunch of base cases we get to.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:10,200 –&gt; 00:09:13,360<br>And then we can start building back up our result.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:13,360 –&gt; 00:09:18,280<br>And the reason why I say it’s inefficient is because, well, we’re exploring these paths.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:18,280 –&gt; 00:09:25,440<br>And as we go along the way, right, we figure out what Fib 3 is and what Fib 4 is, right?</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:25,440 –&gt; 00:09:30,560<br>But then when we explore the right half of Fib 6 over here,</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:30,560 –&gt; 00:09:34,320<br>we’re actually recalculating these values all over again.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:34,320 –&gt; 00:09:36,160<br>That’s why I said we’re not even halfway done.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:36,160 –&gt; 00:09:39,879<br>Because when we got Fib 5, we had to explore Fib 4.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:39,879 –&gt; 00:09:45,879<br>And Fib 4, this branch down here, is basically a copy of this one down here.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:45,879 –&gt; 00:09:46,480<br>OK.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:46,480 –&gt; 00:09:52,439<br>So there’s a lot of work being done here, where you just do the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:52,439 –&gt; 00:09:58,840<br>And so that leads me to say, well, what if we didn’t have to do all this work all over again?</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:58,840 –&gt; 00:09:59,360<br>Right?</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:59,360 –&gt; 00:10:04,799<br>If only there was some sort of data structure that we could use to keep track of things</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:04,799 –&gt; 00:10:07,159<br>as we calculate them, right?</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:07,159 –&gt; 00:10:08,159<br>Right?</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:08,159 –&gt; 00:10:10,639<br>To basically map one thing to another.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:10,639 –&gt; 00:10:16,519<br>So if we already calculated Fib 4 to be some value, why don’t we just look it up?</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:16,519 –&gt; 00:10:23,839<br>So anytime we use things like keeping track of and looking things up, that should ring a</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:23,839 –&gt; 00:10:27,679<br>little bell that says dictionaries can help us do that.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:27,679 –&gt; 00:10:33,600<br>And so what we can do is actually write a more efficient Fibonacci recursive Fibonacci function</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:33,600 –&gt; 00:10:41,600<br>that uses, it’s still recursive, but it uses dictionaries to keep track of values as we calculate them.</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:41,600 –&gt; 00:10:42,600<br>OK.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:42,600 –&gt; 00:10:46,519<br>And so this is the Fibonacci efficient function.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:46,519 –&gt; 00:10:49,040<br>So my name is Fib efficient.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:49,040 –&gt; 00:10:52,159<br>Notice we’re still calculating Fibonacci of some n.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:52,159 –&gt; 00:10:55,680<br>But we’re going to pass in another parameter, a dictionary.</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:55,680 –&gt; 00:11:00,360<br>And this dictionary will keep track of the Fibonacci values as we calculate them.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:00,360 –&gt; 00:11:01,399<br>Calculate them.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:01,399 –&gt; 00:11:05,720<br>So the key will be the n, and the value will be Fib of that n.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:05,720 –&gt; 00:11:06,720<br>OK.</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:06,720 –&gt; 00:11:14,720<br>And so down here you can see we’re going to initialize a dictionary that has Fib of 1 maps to 1, and Fib of 2 maps to 1.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:14,720 –&gt; 00:11:18,559<br>Those are our base cases.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:18,559 –&gt; 00:11:24,519<br>So let’s take a look at our Fibonacci recursive function now that uses dictionaries.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:24,519 –&gt; 00:11:30,840<br>No longer do we need to think about the base cases as Fibonacci of 1 is this and Fibonacci of 2 is this.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:30,840 –&gt; 00:11:35,840<br>Now all we need to do is say, well, let’s look up the value in our dictionary.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:35,840 –&gt; 00:11:38,519<br>That’s what our base case will be.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:38,519 –&gt; 00:11:43,480<br>And we don’t need to make a call to ourselves if the item is already in the dictionary.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:43,480 –&gt; 00:11:53,800<br>So we can just return the value associated with n in dictionary D if that n is already in the dictionary.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:53,800 –&gt; 00:11:58,560<br>So our two base cases down here will initially be in our dictionary.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:58,559 –&gt; 00:12:02,479<br>And as we figure out the values of Fibonacci will add them to the dictionary.</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:02,479 –&gt; 00:12:05,679<br>And that’s exactly what the recursive step will do.</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:05,679 –&gt; 00:12:11,079<br>So else, the values not in our dictionary, so unfortunately we have to calculate it, right?</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:11,079 –&gt; 00:12:11,879<br>Which is fine.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:11,879 –&gt; 00:12:17,319<br>We’ll basically do that the first time through that sort of exploring the left half of our path.</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:17,319 –&gt; 00:12:20,679<br>But that’s pretty much the only times that we’re going to calculate it.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:20,679 –&gt; 00:12:23,639<br>All the other times we’ll just look it up.</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:23,639 –&gt; 00:12:26,720<br>So this is going to be a little different than what we’ve seen before,</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:26,720 –&gt; 00:12:33,519<br>because I’m not right off the bat returning Fibonacci of 1 plus Fibonacci of 2.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:33,519 –&gt; 00:12:39,840<br>I’m actually still running the same recursive step Fibonacci of 1 plus Fibonacci of 2.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:39,840 –&gt; 00:12:41,639<br>But I’m saving it in a variable.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:41,639 –&gt; 00:12:45,080<br>And that’s totally fine to do.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:45,080 –&gt; 00:12:49,360<br>And then before I actually return this value, let me add it to my dictionary.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:49,360 –&gt; 00:12:54,080<br>So this is simply just saying this dictionary at this particular end,</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:54,080 –&gt; 00:12:57,600<br>for this particular function, is equal to this thing that I just calculated.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:57,600 –&gt; 00:13:01,919<br>Just a straight up dictionary addition, adding this item to the dictionary.</p>
<p>183<br>00:13:03,279 –&gt; 00:13:07,720<br>And then after I’ve added it to my dictionary, I can return that value.</p>
<p>184<br>00:13:07,720 –&gt; 00:13:12,399<br>So still passing it back up the chain of function calls, but we’ll save it first.</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:14,240 –&gt; 00:13:15,320<br>Everyone okay with this code?</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:16,320 –&gt; 00:13:24,080<br>Okay, so then this is the dictionary I mentioned where we initialize our two base cases,</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:24,080 –&gt; 00:13:26,120<br>and then we can print the function.</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:26,120 –&gt; 00:13:31,720<br>So let’s trace through the code to see what exactly happens with these function calls now.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:31,720 –&gt; 00:13:35,640<br>So we’re initializing our dictionary where we have N1,</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:35,640 –&gt; 00:13:39,320<br>Fibonacci of 1 is 1, and N2, Fibonacci of 2 is 1, right?</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:39,320 –&gt; 00:13:40,280<br>Our base cases.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:40,280 –&gt; 00:13:44,880<br>Fibonacci of 6 again, we’re doing the same function calls, right?</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:44,879 –&gt; 00:13:48,439<br>So that means there’s nothing stored for Fib 5,</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:48,439 –&gt; 00:13:52,120<br>so we still have to explore what value it will be.</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:52,120 –&gt; 00:13:55,639<br>Nothing stored for Fib 4, we’re still exploring, nothing stored for Fib 3,</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:55,639 –&gt; 00:13:58,600<br>we’re still exploring, we’ve reached a base case.</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:58,600 –&gt; 00:14:03,559<br>So now, the first thing we do is check if it’s in the dictionary.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:03,559 –&gt; 00:14:06,759<br>It is, so we just return the one directly.</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:06,759 –&gt; 00:14:09,639<br>Check if the other half is in the dictionary, return the one directly,</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:09,639 –&gt; 00:14:12,440<br>and now we’ve got a value for Fib 3.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:12,440 –&gt; 00:14:15,760<br>Before returning it, let’s store it in our dictionary.</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:15,760 –&gt; 00:14:18,080<br>So I just calculated what Fib 3 was.</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:18,080 –&gt; 00:14:23,080<br>Let’s put it in, the key is 3, and Fib 3 is 2.</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:23,080 –&gt; 00:14:27,680<br>Okay? So far so good, it’s pretty similar what we’ve done before,</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:27,680 –&gt; 00:14:30,120<br>except that we’re storing this value in the dictionary.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:30,120 –&gt; 00:14:33,520<br>So now we explore the right half of this Fib 4, right?</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:33,520 –&gt; 00:14:36,720<br>Fib 3 plus Fib 2, it’s already in the dictionary,</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:36,720 –&gt; 00:14:40,280<br>so it immediately returns this addition.</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:40,279 –&gt; 00:14:44,079<br>Now we know what Fib 4 is, so we added to our dictionary.</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:44,079 –&gt; 00:14:47,039<br>Fib 4 is 3.</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:47,039 –&gt; 00:14:49,399<br>Explore the right part of Fib 5, right?</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:49,399 –&gt; 00:14:53,319<br>So Fib 4 plus Fib 3, do we go further now?</p>
<p>213<br>00:14:53,319 –&gt; 00:14:55,839<br>Right? In the previous case, we explored 2 and 1.</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:55,839 –&gt; 00:14:58,000<br>In this case, do we keep exploring?</p>
<p>215<br>00:14:58,000 –&gt; 00:15:00,199<br>No, exactly, because our base case says,</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:00,199 –&gt; 00:15:02,319<br>if 3 is already in the dictionary,</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:02,319 –&gt; 00:15:04,919<br>simply return the value associated with it.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:04,919 –&gt; 00:15:06,279<br>So, yep, there it is right there.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:06,279 –&gt; 00:15:07,679<br>We added it a while ago.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:07,679 –&gt; 00:15:12,120<br>We just return the 2 immediately, no need to go down this path.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:12,120 –&gt; 00:15:16,519<br>Okay? So now Fib 5 is done pretty quickly, so the right half,</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:16,519 –&gt; 00:15:18,639<br>so that means we have the value for Fib 5,</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:18,639 –&gt; 00:15:20,479<br>and we added to a dictionary.</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:20,479 –&gt; 00:15:22,879<br>We explore the right half of Fib 6.</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:22,879 –&gt; 00:15:25,719<br>Remember beforehand, I said, when we were not done,</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:25,719 –&gt; 00:15:28,599<br>we don’t need to explore this Fib 4 anymore,</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:28,599 –&gt; 00:15:32,000<br>because we added it to our dictionary long ago.</p>
<p>228<br>00:15:32,000 –&gt; 00:15:35,759<br>So now all we need to do is look up the value associated with 4,</p>
<p>229<br>00:15:35,759 –&gt; 00:15:37,159<br>from our dictionary.</p>
<p>230<br>00:15:38,120 –&gt; 00:15:42,279<br>So, boom, there it is, and then we can just add Fib 5 and Fib 4 together,</p>
<p>231<br>00:15:42,279 –&gt; 00:15:44,439<br>and get the value for Fib 6,</p>
<p>232<br>00:15:44,439 –&gt; 00:15:46,879<br>store it in the dictionary, and this case,</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:46,879 –&gt; 00:15:49,719<br>it’s the end, we don’t need to do anything else with this value,</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:49,719 –&gt; 00:15:51,360<br>passing it back or anything like that.</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:51,360 –&gt; 00:15:56,480<br>Okay? So, we’re not recalculating anything else, right?</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:56,480 –&gt; 00:15:58,799<br>We’re just checking the dictionary, and if need be,</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:58,799 –&gt; 00:15:59,719<br>we calculated.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:59,719 –&gt; 00:16:04,720<br>So, it’s an improvement, but how much of an improvement is it,</p>
<p>239<br>00:16:04,720 –&gt; 00:16:06,079<br>actually?</p>
<p>240<br>00:16:06,080 –&gt; 00:16:09,560<br>So, if we run this function, and it’s in the Python code,</p>
<p>241<br>00:16:09,560 –&gt; 00:16:11,480<br>you can play around with it yourself.</p>
<p>242<br>00:16:11,480 –&gt; 00:16:15,639<br>If you run the function that we originally wrote, Fib,</p>
<p>243<br>00:16:15,639 –&gt; 00:16:18,759<br>the one where we don’t store anything in dictionary,</p>
<p>244<br>00:16:18,759 –&gt; 00:16:21,639<br>if we try to calculate Fib 1acci of 34,</p>
<p>245<br>00:16:23,360 –&gt; 00:16:26,720<br>it results in 11.5 million function calls.</p>
<p>246<br>00:16:28,080 –&gt; 00:16:30,160<br>That’s a lot of function calls,</p>
<p>247<br>00:16:30,160 –&gt; 00:16:34,160<br>because even Fib 6 had Fib 3 being called twice,</p>
<p>248<br>00:16:34,159 –&gt; 00:16:36,919<br>Fib 3 being called three times,</p>
<p>249<br>00:16:36,919 –&gt; 00:16:39,279<br>Fib 4 being called twice, and so on.</p>
<p>250<br>00:16:39,279 –&gt; 00:16:42,759<br>So, can you imagine how many times Fib 3 will be called</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:42,759 –&gt; 00:16:45,120<br>when we are trying to calculate Fib 34?</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:45,120 –&gt; 00:16:48,360<br>Probably thousands, if not more.</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:48,360 –&gt; 00:16:51,799<br>Right? So, overall, the number of function calls we’re making</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:51,799 –&gt; 00:16:54,559<br>is 11.5 million with our original code,</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:54,559 –&gt; 00:16:59,559<br>but the efficient version only makes 65.</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:59,559 –&gt; 00:17:03,360<br>It’s not like we went from 11.5 million to,</p>
<p>257<br>00:17:03,360 –&gt; 00:17:05,240<br>like, two million.</p>
<p>258<br>00:17:05,240 –&gt; 00:17:09,519<br>Right? We went from the order of millions to tens,</p>
<p>259<br>00:17:09,519 –&gt; 00:17:13,160<br>which is really, really impressive in terms of speed.</p>
<p>260<br>00:17:13,160 –&gt; 00:17:14,519<br>So, if you try to run this program,</p>
<p>261<br>00:17:14,519 –&gt; 00:17:17,279<br>it’ll take a couple seconds for Fib 34,</p>
<p>262<br>00:17:17,279 –&gt; 00:17:20,120<br>but the efficient one will be instant.</p>
<p>263<br>00:17:20,120 –&gt; 00:17:23,440<br>And all of these function calls have some overhead, right?</p>
<p>264<br>00:17:23,440 –&gt; 00:17:25,319<br>You need to create an environment in Python,</p>
<p>265<br>00:17:25,319 –&gt; 00:17:27,120<br>and it needs to pass these parameters.</p>
<p>266<br>00:17:27,120 –&gt; 00:17:30,279<br>So, all of these function calls take a lot of time,</p>
<p>267<br>00:17:30,279 –&gt; 00:17:34,240<br>whereas a dictionary lookup is basically instantaneous, right?</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:34,240 –&gt; 00:17:38,359<br>So, in this particular case, we’ve given up some of our memory</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:38,359 –&gt; 00:17:40,519<br>to store values, right?</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:40,519 –&gt; 00:17:43,839<br>The dictionary is storing 34 entries, which is not much,</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:43,839 –&gt; 00:17:47,559<br>but there are applications where you can’t spare 34 entries,</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:47,559 –&gt; 00:17:50,440<br>right, in your memory, in which case,</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:50,440 –&gt; 00:17:54,559<br>you might, you know, spare some time to continue calculating</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:54,559 –&gt; 00:17:55,680<br>without taking up some memory.</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:55,680 –&gt; 00:17:57,000<br>So, there’s a little bit of trade-off</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:57,000 –&gt; 00:17:58,799<br>between these two programs, right?</p>
<p>277<br>00:17:58,799 –&gt; 00:18:01,119<br>One of them doesn’t store anything but is slow.</p>
<p>278<br>00:18:01,119 –&gt; 00:18:03,599<br>The other one stores things, but is fast.</p>
<p>279<br>00:18:04,720 –&gt; 00:18:05,720<br>Okay.</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:05,720 –&gt; 00:18:10,440<br>Let’s look at one more example where we do Fibonacci on numerics,</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:10,440 –&gt; 00:18:13,159<br>and this, I don’t know when you’d use Fibonacci</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:13,159 –&gt; 00:18:17,200<br>in your real life, but knowing all the possible ways</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:17,200 –&gt; 00:18:18,839<br>you can make a score of X,</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:18,839 –&gt; 00:18:21,359<br>it basketball is a little bit more useful.</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:21,359 –&gt; 00:18:24,559<br>So, let’s think about this problem recursively.</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:24,559 –&gt; 00:18:26,680<br>Certainly, we could do it iteratively</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:26,680 –&gt; 00:18:29,720<br>and brute force our way through all the possible combinations</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:29,720 –&gt; 00:18:31,279<br>of scores, right?</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:31,279 –&gt; 00:18:34,480<br>So, in basketball, you can make a basket that’s worth 1.2,</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:34,480 –&gt; 00:18:35,400<br>points or three points.</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:35,400 –&gt; 00:18:37,279<br>So, you can think about all the possible combinations</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:37,279 –&gt; 00:18:40,320<br>you can make to give you some score of X.</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:42,200 –&gt; 00:18:44,440<br>We’re gonna think about this problem recursively, right?</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:44,440 –&gt; 00:18:47,200<br>So, let’s start with our base cases.</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:47,200 –&gt; 00:18:48,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>296<br>00:18:48,680 –&gt; 00:18:50,759<br>Base cases, we’ve got three of them.</p>
<p>297<br>00:18:51,759 –&gt; 00:18:54,279<br>So, if we think about a score of one,</p>
<p>298<br>00:18:54,279 –&gt; 00:18:55,640<br>so if X is equal to one,</p>
<p>299<br>00:18:55,640 –&gt; 00:18:58,640<br>so that means if we have a score of one in basketball,</p>
<p>300<br>00:18:58,640 –&gt; 00:19:01,440<br>what are all the possible ways we could have made a one?</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:01,440 –&gt; 00:19:04,800<br>Well, you could just score one point, and then that’s it, right?</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:04,800 –&gt; 00:19:06,840<br>I just did one plus C or just emphasized</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:06,840 –&gt; 00:19:08,800<br>that we’re just scoring one in nothing.</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:09,800 –&gt; 00:19:11,920<br>If we make a basket, that’s worth two points,</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:11,920 –&gt; 00:19:13,880<br>or if we have two points in basketball,</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:13,880 –&gt; 00:19:17,000<br>what are all the possible ways we could have made two?</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:17,000 –&gt; 00:19:19,360<br>Well, we could have scored a one and a one,</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:19,360 –&gt; 00:19:21,440<br>or we could have just scored two right off the bat.</p>
<p>309<br>00:19:21,440 –&gt; 00:19:25,120<br>So, that’s two possible ways to make a score of two, right?</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:25,920 –&gt; 00:19:28,000<br>And similarly, to make a score of three,</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:28,000 –&gt; 00:19:29,320<br>what are all the possible ways?</p>
<p>312<br>00:19:29,320 –&gt; 00:19:32,000<br>Well, we could have scored a one, then a one, then a one.</p>
<p>313<br>00:19:32,000 –&gt; 00:19:33,680<br>We could have scored a two and a one,</p>
<p>314<br>00:19:33,680 –&gt; 00:19:35,560<br>or we could have scored a three right off the bat.</p>
<p>315<br>00:19:35,560 –&gt; 00:19:37,880<br>So, that’s three different ways you can make a score</p>
<p>316<br>00:19:37,880 –&gt; 00:19:39,720<br>of three in basketball.</p>
<p>317<br>00:19:42,360 –&gt; 00:19:43,600<br>Everyone with me so far.</p>
<p>318<br>00:19:43,600 –&gt; 00:19:45,080<br>These are our base cases, okay?</p>
<p>319<br>00:19:46,400 –&gt; 00:19:49,200<br>Because the recursive step will be very,</p>
<p>320<br>00:19:49,200 –&gt; 00:19:51,400<br>will blow your minds, it’s so simple, okay?</p>
<p>321<br>00:19:51,400 –&gt; 00:19:54,840<br>So, the recursive step looks like this.</p>
<p>322<br>00:19:56,240 –&gt; 00:19:57,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>323<br>00:19:57,240 –&gt; 00:20:02,080<br>Now, somebody give me, what’s a reasonable basketball score?</p>
<p>324<br>00:20:02,080 –&gt; 00:20:04,560<br>Like, for a team, 87?</p>
<p>325<br>00:20:04,560 –&gt; 00:20:05,800<br>Okay.</p>
<p>326<br>00:20:05,800 –&gt; 00:20:09,480<br>It’s been probably 25 years since I’ve played</p>
<p>327<br>00:20:09,480 –&gt; 00:20:11,480<br>pro basketball in grade five, you guys.</p>
<p>328<br>00:20:11,480 –&gt; 00:20:14,200<br>So, I forgot what’s a reasonable score.</p>
<p>329<br>00:20:14,200 –&gt; 00:20:15,800<br>All right, so 87.</p>
<p>330<br>00:20:15,800 –&gt; 00:20:18,640<br>So, let’s say now, we’re not dealing with our base case.</p>
<p>331<br>00:20:18,640 –&gt; 00:20:21,680<br>We’re dealing with some number that’s bigger</p>
<p>332<br>00:20:21,680 –&gt; 00:20:23,600<br>than one of these base cases.</p>
<p>333<br>00:20:23,599 –&gt; 00:20:25,879<br>How do we think about this problem recursively?</p>
<p>334<br>00:20:27,399 –&gt; 00:20:30,279<br>Well, there’s three possibilities, right?</p>
<p>335<br>00:20:30,279 –&gt; 00:20:32,439<br>If I have a final score of 87,</p>
<p>336<br>00:20:33,279 –&gt; 00:20:38,279<br>let’s say that I think about the score of 86, right?</p>
<p>337<br>00:20:40,839 –&gt; 00:20:44,559<br>If I know all the possible ways I can make a score of 86,</p>
<p>338<br>00:20:45,399 –&gt; 00:20:50,279<br>all I need to do is add one to that score, right?</p>
<p>339<br>00:20:50,279 –&gt; 00:20:53,079<br>It’ll give me 87, right?</p>
<p>340<br>00:20:53,079 –&gt; 00:20:56,159<br>So, that’s one possibility here.</p>
<p>341<br>00:20:56,159 –&gt; 00:20:59,639<br>But that’s not the only possibility, right?</p>
<p>342<br>00:20:59,639 –&gt; 00:21:03,159<br>Because I could have a score of 85,</p>
<p>343<br>00:21:04,119 –&gt; 00:21:08,279<br>and if I add two to that 85, not two counts, right?</p>
<p>344<br>00:21:08,279 –&gt; 00:21:09,119<br>Just the score.</p>
<p>345<br>00:21:09,119 –&gt; 00:21:11,119<br>If I have an original score of 85,</p>
<p>346<br>00:21:11,119 –&gt; 00:21:13,159<br>if I just add two to that score,</p>
<p>347<br>00:21:13,159 –&gt; 00:21:16,480<br>it gives me my desired score of 87.</p>
<p>348<br>00:21:16,480 –&gt; 00:21:20,359<br>So, if I know the possible combinations to make 85,</p>
<p>349<br>00:21:20,359 –&gt; 00:21:22,240<br>then I know that all I need to do</p>
<p>350<br>00:21:22,240 –&gt; 00:21:26,079<br>is, you know, add a two to my score, and that’ll give me 87.</p>
<p>351<br>00:21:26,079 –&gt; 00:21:32,079<br>And then the last possibility is to know all the possible ways</p>
<p>352<br>00:21:32,400 –&gt; 00:21:34,960<br>to make 84, a score of 84,</p>
<p>353<br>00:21:34,960 –&gt; 00:21:37,160<br>because then I would just add a score,</p>
<p>354<br>00:21:37,160 –&gt; 00:21:41,000<br>I would take that score and add a three to it to give me 87, right?</p>
<p>355<br>00:21:41,000 –&gt; 00:21:46,000<br>So, I’m sort of using my base cases to guide my recursive step.</p>
<p>356<br>00:21:46,599 –&gt; 00:21:50,759<br>So, the number of ways I can make a score of 87</p>
<p>357<br>00:21:50,759 –&gt; 00:21:54,519<br>is the sum of all the possible ways I can make 86,</p>
<p>358<br>00:21:54,519 –&gt; 00:21:58,160<br>or 85, or 84, right?</p>
<p>359<br>00:21:59,400 –&gt; 00:22:01,640<br>Because if I made 86, I would just add one to it,</p>
<p>360<br>00:22:01,640 –&gt; 00:22:03,039<br>if I made 85, I had two to it,</p>
<p>361<br>00:22:03,039 –&gt; 00:22:05,519<br>and if I made 84, I’d add three to the score.</p>
<p>362<br>00:22:07,000 –&gt; 00:22:11,319<br>So, that’s essentially what this recursive step is doing, right?</p>
<p>363<br>00:22:11,319 –&gt; 00:22:14,920<br>I’ve got, these are all the possible ways I can make a score of 80,</p>
<p>364<br>00:22:14,920 –&gt; 00:22:16,720<br>you know, x minus one, right?</p>
<p>365<br>00:22:16,720 –&gt; 00:22:18,000<br>So, 87, 86.</p>
<p>366<br>00:22:18,880 –&gt; 00:22:21,240<br>And that’s just me calling my function, right?</p>
<p>367<br>00:22:21,240 –&gt; 00:22:23,759<br>So, score count x minus one, score count x.</p>
<p>368<br>00:22:24,759 –&gt; 00:22:27,440<br>Plus all the possible ways to make a score of x minus two.</p>
<p>369<br>00:22:28,640 –&gt; 00:22:31,559<br>Plus all the possible ways to make a score of x minus three.</p>
<p>370<br>00:22:31,559 –&gt; 00:22:34,400<br>So, if I add all these three ways together,</p>
<p>371<br>00:22:34,400 –&gt; 00:22:38,319<br>I would get all the possible ways I can make a score of x.</p>
<p>372<br>00:22:40,920 –&gt; 00:22:41,640<br>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>373<br>00:22:43,880 –&gt; 00:22:44,400<br>Okay.</p>
<p>374<br>00:22:45,640 –&gt; 00:22:47,319<br>So, that’s it, right?</p>
<p>375<br>00:22:47,319 –&gt; 00:22:48,639<br>It’s pretty clean code.</p>
<p>376<br>00:22:48,639 –&gt; 00:22:50,480<br>It looks really nice.</p>
<p>377<br>00:22:50,480 –&gt; 00:22:52,960<br>If we were to write this iteratively, it would be a mess.</p>
<p>378<br>00:22:53,960 –&gt; 00:22:56,799<br>Because we probably have a whole bunch of nested loops</p>
<p>379<br>00:22:56,799 –&gt; 00:22:59,359<br>to try to brute force all the possible combinations</p>
<p>380<br>00:22:59,359 –&gt; 00:23:00,519<br>of scores that we can make.</p>
<p>381<br>00:23:01,480 –&gt; 00:23:04,879<br>And it wouldn’t look very, very nice, very pithonic.</p>
<p>382<br>00:23:08,519 –&gt; 00:23:12,079<br>So, let’s do a trace of this code, just to, you know,</p>
<p>383<br>00:23:12,079 –&gt; 00:23:13,879<br>to bring it all together.</p>
<p>384<br>00:23:13,879 –&gt; 00:23:16,559<br>The trace will be very similar to the Fibonacci trace.</p>
<p>385<br>00:23:16,559 –&gt; 00:23:19,480<br>Except that now we have three paths to explore</p>
<p>386<br>00:23:19,480 –&gt; 00:23:22,159<br>before having a return value, right?</p>
<p>387<br>00:23:22,159 –&gt; 00:23:27,079<br>So, for a score of six, I would explore how can I make a score of five?</p>
<p>388<br>00:23:27,079 –&gt; 00:23:30,879<br>And of course, I will explore how can I make a score of four in three,</p>
<p>389<br>00:23:30,879 –&gt; 00:23:33,079<br>but I’m not there yet, right?</p>
<p>390<br>00:23:33,079 –&gt; 00:23:35,039<br>First, I need to explore how to make a score of five,</p>
<p>391<br>00:23:35,039 –&gt; 00:23:36,480<br>which is a function call.</p>
<p>392<br>00:23:36,480 –&gt; 00:23:39,000<br>This one will explore how to make a score of four,</p>
<p>393<br>00:23:39,000 –&gt; 00:23:42,000<br>and of course, a three and a two, but not just yet.</p>
<p>394<br>00:23:42,000 –&gt; 00:23:45,599<br>A score of four will lead us to our base cases.</p>
<p>395<br>00:23:45,599 –&gt; 00:23:48,759<br>It’s just how to make a score of three in a two and a one.</p>
<p>396<br>00:23:48,759 –&gt; 00:23:50,199<br>These are base cases.</p>
<p>397<br>00:23:50,199 –&gt; 00:23:53,240<br>They immediately return, and we know how to make a score of four.</p>
<p>398<br>00:23:53,240 –&gt; 00:23:55,039<br>A score of three is also base case,</p>
<p>399<br>00:23:55,039 –&gt; 00:23:56,639<br>and a score of two is also base case.</p>
<p>400<br>00:23:56,639 –&gt; 00:23:59,719<br>So, these ones will immediately return to give us the score of five.</p>
<p>401<br>00:24:00,959 –&gt; 00:24:02,519<br>So, now we know how to make a score of five.</p>
<p>402<br>00:24:02,519 –&gt; 00:24:05,159<br>We need to follow through how to make a score of four,</p>
<p>403<br>00:24:05,159 –&gt; 00:24:07,240<br>which is just three and two and one.</p>
<p>404<br>00:24:07,240 –&gt; 00:24:09,240<br>Oops, I should change that to be a one.</p>
<p>405<br>00:24:10,240 –&gt; 00:24:12,799<br>And then how to make a score of three,</p>
<p>406<br>00:24:12,799 –&gt; 00:24:15,000<br>and that’s just a base case.</p>
<p>407<br>00:24:15,119 –&gt; 00:24:18,920<br>So, very similar trace as the Fibonacci code.</p>
<p>408<br>00:24:21,599 –&gt; 00:24:24,720<br>All right, questions about those examples.</p>
<p>409<br>00:24:25,880 –&gt; 00:24:26,720<br>Are they okay?</p>
<p>410<br>00:24:26,720 –&gt; 00:24:28,799<br>Do they make sense?</p>
<p>411<br>00:24:28,799 –&gt; 00:24:29,640<br>Okay.</p>
<p>412<br>00:24:30,960 –&gt; 00:24:34,519<br>So, there is one exercise in the Python file.</p>
<p>413<br>00:24:34,519 –&gt; 00:24:37,000<br>It’s for at home.</p>
<p>414<br>00:24:37,000 –&gt; 00:24:40,359<br>I would like you to try to memoize this code.</p>
<p>415<br>00:24:40,359 –&gt; 00:24:43,640<br>So, memoize means basically try to use a memo,</p>
<p>416<br>00:24:43,640 –&gt; 00:24:47,840<br>a dictionary, to store values as you calculate them.</p>
<p>417<br>00:24:47,840 –&gt; 00:24:50,400<br>Because you see that it’s going to be just as inefficient</p>
<p>418<br>00:24:50,400 –&gt; 00:24:51,920<br>as the Fibonacci code, right?</p>
<p>419<br>00:24:51,920 –&gt; 00:24:54,480<br>So, here we’re calculating score of four again,</p>
<p>420<br>00:24:54,480 –&gt; 00:24:58,200<br>where we had calculated it way back here, right?</p>
<p>421<br>00:24:58,200 –&gt; 00:25:02,520<br>And so, try your hand at adding a dictionary to this code</p>
<p>422<br>00:25:02,520 –&gt; 00:25:04,640<br>to try to speed it up.</p>
<p>423<br>00:25:06,840 –&gt; 00:25:10,680<br>Okay, so the next, the second half of this lecture,</p>
<p>424<br>00:25:10,680 –&gt; 00:25:14,160<br>we’re now going to move away from recursion on numbers</p>
<p>425<br>00:25:14,160 –&gt; 00:25:17,519<br>and sort of having these nice mathematical operations</p>
<p>426<br>00:25:17,519 –&gt; 00:25:20,080<br>that we can just translate to code easily,</p>
<p>427<br>00:25:20,080 –&gt; 00:25:25,160<br>and start looking at recursion on numerical things.</p>
<p>428<br>00:25:25,160 –&gt; 00:25:26,920<br>And we’re just going to look at lists.</p>
<p>429<br>00:25:26,920 –&gt; 00:25:30,000<br>But again, as I said, you can apply these very similar codes</p>
<p>430<br>00:25:30,000 –&gt; 00:25:33,160<br>to any sequences of values,</p>
<p>431<br>00:25:33,160 –&gt; 00:25:35,640<br>tuples or strings or things like that.</p>
<p>432<br>00:25:37,000 –&gt; 00:25:38,880<br>So, the reason why we’re looking at lists</p>
<p>433<br>00:25:38,880 –&gt; 00:25:40,800<br>is because lists are naturally recursive.</p>
<p>434<br>00:25:40,800 –&gt; 00:25:44,600<br>So, one of the motivations I gave at the end of last lecture</p>
<p>435<br>00:25:44,600 –&gt; 00:25:49,120<br>is that we have lists that can have elements that are other lists,</p>
<p>436<br>00:25:49,120 –&gt; 00:25:50,920<br>that can have elements that are other lists,</p>
<p>437<br>00:25:50,920 –&gt; 00:25:52,800<br>that can have elements as other lists.</p>
<p>438<br>00:25:52,800 –&gt; 00:25:56,400<br>So, without knowing sort of how deep these lists</p>
<p>439<br>00:25:56,400 –&gt; 00:26:00,600<br>within lists go, it’s going to be really hard</p>
<p>440<br>00:26:00,600 –&gt; 00:26:01,960<br>to write iterative code.</p>
<p>441<br>00:26:01,960 –&gt; 00:26:04,560<br>It’s possible, but it’s going to be really hard.</p>
<p>442<br>00:26:04,560 –&gt; 00:26:07,600<br>And instead, we’re going to see that the recursive version</p>
<p>443<br>00:26:07,599 –&gt; 00:26:11,159<br>of this code is going to be a lot more intuitive</p>
<p>444<br>00:26:11,159 –&gt; 00:26:15,559<br>in the long run, maybe not right off the bat,</p>
<p>445<br>00:26:15,559 –&gt; 00:26:20,039<br>but definitely it’s a lot easier to write and to read.</p>
<p>446<br>00:26:21,639 –&gt; 00:26:26,159<br>So, let’s think about lists in a recursive way.</p>
<p>447<br>00:26:27,000 –&gt; 00:26:28,439<br>So, if we were doing iteratively,</p>
<p>448<br>00:26:28,439 –&gt; 00:26:31,359<br>what we’d say is we’re going to loop through each element</p>
<p>449<br>00:26:31,359 –&gt; 00:26:32,639<br>and do something.</p>
<p>450<br>00:26:32,639 –&gt; 00:26:34,199<br>And the problem we’re going to solve</p>
<p>451<br>00:26:34,199 –&gt; 00:26:37,079<br>is figuring out the sum of all the elements in a list</p>
<p>452<br>00:26:37,079 –&gt; 00:26:38,279<br>to begin with.</p>
<p>453<br>00:26:38,279 –&gt; 00:26:39,960<br>So, iteratively, we just said, right,</p>
<p>454<br>00:26:39,960 –&gt; 00:26:41,639<br>we loop over each element in the list</p>
<p>455<br>00:26:41,639 –&gt; 00:26:43,759<br>and keep it in our result.</p>
<p>456<br>00:26:43,759 –&gt; 00:26:47,079<br>So, I’ve got these state variables I talked about last time,</p>
<p>457<br>00:26:47,079 –&gt; 00:26:48,919<br>right, result in e that keep track</p>
<p>458<br>00:26:48,919 –&gt; 00:26:51,319<br>of which element we’re at and what the value is.</p>
<p>459<br>00:26:52,599 –&gt; 00:26:57,519<br>recursively, remember, we’re going to make all these function calls</p>
<p>460<br>00:26:57,519 –&gt; 00:27:00,039<br>until we get to a base case, at which point we’re going</p>
<p>461<br>00:27:00,039 –&gt; 00:27:02,679<br>to start to build up our result.</p>
<p>462<br>00:27:03,680 –&gt; 00:27:08,400<br>So, how can we think about this list recursively?</p>
<p>463<br>00:27:08,400 –&gt; 00:27:11,240<br>Well, let’s say that we have a list</p>
<p>464<br>00:27:11,240 –&gt; 00:27:13,320<br>and we want to find the sum of all these elements.</p>
<p>465<br>00:27:13,320 –&gt; 00:27:14,840<br>That’s our original problem.</p>
<p>466<br>00:27:16,720 –&gt; 00:27:19,320<br>Now, let’s say that we take the first element</p>
<p>467<br>00:27:20,279 –&gt; 00:27:23,360<br>and we just extract it out, right?</p>
<p>468<br>00:27:23,360 –&gt; 00:27:25,920<br>We know we have this list with a bunch of elements,</p>
<p>469<br>00:27:25,920 –&gt; 00:27:28,200<br>let’s take the first one, we know it’s a 10.</p>
<p>470<br>00:27:29,200 –&gt; 00:27:32,640<br>And then let’s consider the remaining elements.</p>
<p>471<br>00:27:32,640 –&gt; 00:27:37,640<br>So, the 20 onward, if I take my 10,</p>
<p>472<br>00:27:41,880 –&gt; 00:27:45,360<br>and I know the answer to the sum of all the elements</p>
<p>473<br>00:27:45,360 –&gt; 00:27:49,440<br>in 20 onward, right, then all I need to do</p>
<p>474<br>00:27:49,440 –&gt; 00:27:52,360<br>to figure out the sum of my original list, right?</p>
<p>475<br>00:27:52,360 –&gt; 00:27:56,200<br>This one here is to say it’s the 10 plus the sum</p>
<p>476<br>00:27:56,200 –&gt; 00:27:59,200<br>of whatever the sum of the 20 onward is.</p>
<p>477<br>00:28:01,000 –&gt; 00:28:05,759<br>Now, the sum for elements 20 onward is the same problem again,</p>
<p>478<br>00:28:05,759 –&gt; 00:28:07,720<br>right? It’s the problem of finding the sum</p>
<p>479<br>00:28:07,720 –&gt; 00:28:09,680<br>of all the elements in a list.</p>
<p>480<br>00:28:09,680 –&gt; 00:28:13,840<br>It just so happens that our list is now our original list</p>
<p>481<br>00:28:13,840 –&gt; 00:28:15,880<br>without that first element in it.</p>
<p>482<br>00:28:16,920 –&gt; 00:28:18,960<br>Does everyone understand that, right?</p>
<p>483<br>00:28:18,960 –&gt; 00:28:20,120<br>We’ve got our original problem</p>
<p>484<br>00:28:20,120 –&gt; 00:28:22,400<br>and we’ve just made the same problem again,</p>
<p>485<br>00:28:22,400 –&gt; 00:28:24,400<br>just a slightly different version of it.</p>
<p>486<br>00:28:24,400 –&gt; 00:28:27,160<br>All the lists except for that first element.</p>
<p>487<br>00:28:27,160 –&gt; 00:28:29,440<br>So now we do the same thing, right?</p>
<p>488<br>00:28:29,440 –&gt; 00:28:31,640<br>Let’s say this is our new list,</p>
<p>489<br>00:28:31,640 –&gt; 00:28:34,280<br>we extract the first element from it,</p>
<p>490<br>00:28:34,280 –&gt; 00:28:38,080<br>and we consider the elements except for that first one</p>
<p>491<br>00:28:38,080 –&gt; 00:28:39,800<br>as a new list.</p>
<p>492<br>00:28:39,800 –&gt; 00:28:43,080<br>And again, if I knew what the sum of 30 all the way</p>
<p>493<br>00:28:43,080 –&gt; 00:28:46,000<br>on to 60 was, all I need to do is add it to the 20</p>
<p>494<br>00:28:46,000 –&gt; 00:28:49,800<br>that I extracted and I would know the sum of this list.</p>
<p>495<br>00:28:49,800 –&gt; 00:28:51,080<br>So we keep doing that, right?</p>
<p>496<br>00:28:51,080 –&gt; 00:28:54,000<br>We take our list, extract the 30,</p>
<p>497<br>00:28:54,000 –&gt; 00:28:57,480<br>and consider the remaining elements as a list.</p>
<p>498<br>00:28:57,480 –&gt; 00:29:01,119<br>Same deal, if I knew what 40 plus 50 plus 60 was, right?</p>
<p>499<br>00:29:01,119 –&gt; 00:29:02,640<br>The sum of all the elements in this list,</p>
<p>500<br>00:29:02,640 –&gt; 00:29:06,759<br>I just added to the 30 and I have the answer to that problem.</p>
<p>501<br>00:29:06,759 –&gt; 00:29:09,200<br>And we keep doing this, extracting an element</p>
<p>502<br>00:29:09,200 –&gt; 00:29:11,039<br>and considering the remaining lists,</p>
<p>503<br>00:29:11,039 –&gt; 00:29:13,279<br>all the way down to when we have a list</p>
<p>504<br>00:29:13,279 –&gt; 00:29:15,559<br>with just one element in it.</p>
<p>505<br>00:29:15,559 –&gt; 00:29:18,240<br>Well, this is a pretty simple problem to solve.</p>
<p>506<br>00:29:18,240 –&gt; 00:29:19,960<br>If I have a list with one element in it,</p>
<p>507<br>00:29:19,960 –&gt; 00:29:22,200<br>the sum of the elements within that list</p>
<p>508<br>00:29:22,200 –&gt; 00:29:24,200<br>is just the value of that element, right?</p>
<p>509<br>00:29:24,200 –&gt; 00:29:25,759<br>It’s just 60.</p>
<p>510<br>00:29:25,759 –&gt; 00:29:29,840<br>So a very simple problem, no need to keep sort of going further</p>
<p>511<br>00:29:29,840 –&gt; 00:29:31,840<br>dividing this problem into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>512<br>00:29:31,840 –&gt; 00:29:33,200<br>I already know the answer to this one.</p>
<p>513<br>00:29:33,200 –&gt; 00:29:34,920<br>It’s very simple.</p>
<p>514<br>00:29:34,920 –&gt; 00:29:39,600<br>So this is our base case and we know the sum of the elements</p>
<p>515<br>00:29:39,600 –&gt; 00:29:44,080<br>of in a list with the length one is that element.</p>
<p>516<br>00:29:44,080 –&gt; 00:29:47,279<br>So once we reach the base case, we build back up our result,</p>
<p>517<br>00:29:47,279 –&gt; 00:29:48,160<br>right?</p>
<p>518<br>00:29:48,160 –&gt; 00:29:53,440<br>We take the 60 and we had extracted the 50 originally.</p>
<p>519<br>00:29:53,440 –&gt; 00:29:56,519<br>So we’re going to pass the sum back up to whoever called it,</p>
<p>520<br>00:29:56,519 –&gt; 00:29:59,320<br>which was the function that extracted the 50.</p>
<p>521<br>00:29:59,320 –&gt; 00:30:01,920<br>So now the 50 plus the 60 is 110.</p>
<p>522<br>00:30:01,920 –&gt; 00:30:04,960<br>Now this 110 gets passed back up the chain.</p>
<p>523<br>00:30:04,960 –&gt; 00:30:06,759<br>When we extracted the 40, we said,</p>
<p>524<br>00:30:06,759 –&gt; 00:30:09,640<br>well, I’m going to add the 40 to the sum of the 50 and the 60,</p>
<p>525<br>00:30:09,640 –&gt; 00:30:11,840<br>110, which is 150.</p>
<p>526<br>00:30:11,840 –&gt; 00:30:13,640<br>Pass that answer back up the chain.</p>
<p>527<br>00:30:13,640 –&gt; 00:30:16,080<br>When I extracted the 30, I said,</p>
<p>528<br>00:30:16,079 –&gt; 00:30:18,480<br>I was just going to add the 30 with the sum of the remaining</p>
<p>529<br>00:30:18,480 –&gt; 00:30:21,159<br>things, which I figured out is 150.</p>
<p>530<br>00:30:21,159 –&gt; 00:30:22,119<br>The 20, right?</p>
<p>531<br>00:30:22,119 –&gt; 00:30:25,559<br>I had extracted it, becomes 20 plus the sum of everybody else,</p>
<p>532<br>00:30:25,559 –&gt; 00:30:26,599<br>which is 180.</p>
<p>533<br>00:30:26,599 –&gt; 00:30:27,639<br>So the sum is 200.</p>
<p>534<br>00:30:27,639 –&gt; 00:30:29,559<br>And then finally, my original question</p>
<p>535<br>00:30:29,559 –&gt; 00:30:32,919<br>was to extract the 10, add it to everything else,</p>
<p>536<br>00:30:32,919 –&gt; 00:30:34,799<br>which is the 200 that we figured out.</p>
<p>537<br>00:30:34,799 –&gt; 00:30:35,759<br>So the full sum is 210.</p>
<p>538<br>00:30:38,759 –&gt; 00:30:39,799<br>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>539<br>00:30:39,799 –&gt; 00:30:41,480<br>This animation.</p>
<p>540<br>00:30:41,480 –&gt; 00:30:44,399<br>So we’ve got the division, all the way down to the base case,</p>
<p>541<br>00:30:44,400 –&gt; 00:30:46,440<br>and building back up the result.</p>
<p>542<br>00:30:46,440 –&gt; 00:30:47,880<br>So let’s try to write it.</p>
<p>543<br>00:30:47,880 –&gt; 00:30:50,360<br>So we’re going to write it in pieces.</p>
<p>544<br>00:30:50,360 –&gt; 00:30:52,600<br>So the function is called total recur.</p>
<p>545<br>00:30:52,600 –&gt; 00:30:54,840<br>It takes in a list L. We’re going to recursively</p>
<p>546<br>00:30:54,840 –&gt; 00:30:58,000<br>figure out the sum of all the elements in this list.</p>
<p>547<br>00:30:58,000 –&gt; 00:31:00,759<br>So we can have a base case when the list is empty.</p>
<p>548<br>00:31:00,759 –&gt; 00:31:03,360<br>We can return 0 up to you.</p>
<p>549<br>00:31:03,360 –&gt; 00:31:04,920<br>Another base case, which is the one</p>
<p>550<br>00:31:04,920 –&gt; 00:31:06,440<br>that I illustrated on the previous slide</p>
<p>551<br>00:31:06,440 –&gt; 00:31:10,280<br>is when the length of the list is 1.</p>
<p>552<br>00:31:10,280 –&gt; 00:31:13,440<br>So when the length of the list is 1, what’s the sum going to be?</p>
<p>553<br>00:31:13,440 –&gt; 00:31:14,480<br>No need for recursion.</p>
<p>554<br>00:31:14,480 –&gt; 00:31:16,559<br>It’s just that element.</p>
<p>555<br>00:31:16,559 –&gt; 00:31:19,080<br>And so in these slides, what I’ve also included,</p>
<p>556<br>00:31:19,080 –&gt; 00:31:21,840<br>in addition to the code, is an a little example.</p>
<p>557<br>00:31:21,840 –&gt; 00:31:24,799<br>So it helps you think about what the function returns.</p>
<p>558<br>00:31:24,799 –&gt; 00:31:27,360<br>So in this base case, when the length of the list is 1,</p>
<p>559<br>00:31:27,360 –&gt; 00:31:29,400<br>the list would look something like this.</p>
<p>560<br>00:31:29,400 –&gt; 00:31:33,160<br>And all I’d need to do is return L at index 0.</p>
<p>561<br>00:31:33,160 –&gt; 00:31:33,960<br>So the 50.</p>
<p>562<br>00:31:33,960 –&gt; 00:31:35,960<br>And that’s my sum.</p>
<p>563<br>00:31:35,960 –&gt; 00:31:39,600<br>And that’s what I’m doing here, returning L at index 0.</p>
<p>564<br>00:31:39,600 –&gt; 00:31:40,680<br>Cool.</p>
<p>565<br>00:31:40,680 –&gt; 00:31:42,920<br>Now, the recursive step.</p>
<p>566<br>00:31:42,920 –&gt; 00:31:46,320<br>Remember, in the recursive step, I extracted the first element.</p>
<p>567<br>00:31:46,320 –&gt; 00:31:48,840<br>And I said, let me save this first element.</p>
<p>568<br>00:31:48,840 –&gt; 00:31:52,519<br>So here it is being saved as L at index 0.</p>
<p>569<br>00:31:52,519 –&gt; 00:31:54,240<br>And I’m going to add it to something.</p>
<p>570<br>00:31:54,240 –&gt; 00:31:57,640<br>So in this example here, I’ve got this list that’s</p>
<p>571<br>00:31:57,640 –&gt; 00:31:59,039<br>longer than 1.</p>
<p>572<br>00:31:59,039 –&gt; 00:32:01,240<br>I’m extracting the 30, L at index 0, and I’m</p>
<p>573<br>00:32:01,240 –&gt; 00:32:04,160<br>going to add it to something.</p>
<p>574<br>00:32:04,160 –&gt; 00:32:09,600<br>Well, that’s something, based on the previous slide,</p>
<p>575<br>00:32:09,600 –&gt; 00:32:11,560<br>where I did the animation, is going</p>
<p>576<br>00:32:11,559 –&gt; 00:32:15,279<br>to be us putting our trust in the fact</p>
<p>577<br>00:32:15,279 –&gt; 00:32:18,480<br>that we write this function correctly.</p>
<p>578<br>00:32:18,480 –&gt; 00:32:23,319<br>That something is going to be us figuring out what the sum is</p>
<p>579<br>00:32:23,319 –&gt; 00:32:25,720<br>of 40 and 50.</p>
<p>580<br>00:32:25,720 –&gt; 00:32:27,519<br>It’s the same problem we’re trying to solve right now,</p>
<p>581<br>00:32:27,519 –&gt; 00:32:29,279<br>the sum of 30, 40, 50.</p>
<p>582<br>00:32:29,279 –&gt; 00:32:32,240<br>Except that now, I’m just going to take the sum of just the 40</p>
<p>583<br>00:32:32,240 –&gt; 00:32:34,240<br>and the 50.</p>
<p>584<br>00:32:34,240 –&gt; 00:32:37,799<br>So that something becomes the same function we’re writing right</p>
<p>585<br>00:32:37,799 –&gt; 00:32:41,039<br>now, total recur.</p>
<p>586<br>00:32:41,039 –&gt; 00:32:44,639<br>Except that I’m not calling it on L, not the whole thing all</p>
<p>587<br>00:32:44,639 –&gt; 00:32:45,200<br>over again.</p>
<p>588<br>00:32:45,200 –&gt; 00:32:46,240<br>That would be bad.</p>
<p>589<br>00:32:46,240 –&gt; 00:32:49,119<br>But I’m going to call it on L from index 1 onwards.</p>
<p>590<br>00:32:49,119 –&gt; 00:32:53,480<br>So essentially, removing that first element.</p>
<p>591<br>00:32:53,480 –&gt; 00:32:54,559<br>Is everyone OK with that?</p>
<p>592<br>00:32:58,639 –&gt; 00:32:59,879<br>So that’s it.</p>
<p>593<br>00:32:59,879 –&gt; 00:33:00,759<br>That’s the function.</p>
<p>594<br>00:33:00,759 –&gt; 00:33:03,079<br>Nothing else to write, no loop.</p>
<p>595<br>00:33:03,079 –&gt; 00:33:04,919<br>We’ve basically written a function,</p>
<p>596<br>00:33:04,919 –&gt; 00:33:07,680<br>assuming that we wrote the function correctly.</p>
<p>597<br>00:33:08,200 –&gt; 00:33:12,120<br>Which is a very strange way to think about recursion.</p>
<p>598<br>00:33:12,120 –&gt; 00:33:13,360<br>But that’s essentially what it is.</p>
<p>599<br>00:33:13,360 –&gt; 00:33:16,600<br>You’re trusting yourself to write this function correctly</p>
<p>600<br>00:33:16,600 –&gt; 00:33:19,480<br>such that your recursive step leads you to the base case</p>
<p>601<br>00:33:19,480 –&gt; 00:33:22,360<br>so that you can build back up the result correctly.</p>
<p>602<br>00:33:22,360 –&gt; 00:33:23,759<br>So there’s a lot of trust involved</p>
<p>603<br>00:33:23,759 –&gt; 00:33:25,160<br>in writing these functions recursive.</p>
<p>604<br>00:33:30,799 –&gt; 00:33:32,680<br>OK, so I’m not going to go through the Python tutor,</p>
<p>605<br>00:33:32,680 –&gt; 00:33:35,759<br>but you should definitely go through it on your own</p>
<p>606<br>00:33:35,759 –&gt; 00:33:39,480<br>as a practice for the quiz, things like that.</p>
<p>607<br>00:33:39,480 –&gt; 00:33:41,680<br>Let’s have you write this then.</p>
<p>608<br>00:33:41,680 –&gt; 00:33:43,559<br>So it’s going to be a slight modification</p>
<p>609<br>00:33:43,559 –&gt; 00:33:45,839<br>to the code we just wrote.</p>
<p>610<br>00:33:45,839 –&gt; 00:33:50,039<br>So it’s going to take in a list as its parameter.</p>
<p>611<br>00:33:50,039 –&gt; 00:33:52,519<br>And instead of summing the elements in the list,</p>
<p>612<br>00:33:52,519 –&gt; 00:33:55,160<br>like we did 10 plus 20 plus 30, whatever,</p>
<p>613<br>00:33:55,160 –&gt; 00:33:59,079<br>I would like you to sum the lengths of the elements in the list.</p>
<p>614<br>00:33:59,079 –&gt; 00:34:00,759<br>So if I pass it in this function,</p>
<p>615<br>00:34:00,759 –&gt; 00:34:04,200<br>it’s going to sum the length of this 2 plus the length of this 1</p>
<p>616<br>00:34:04,200 –&gt; 00:34:05,720<br>plus the length of this 5.</p>
<p>617<br>00:34:05,720 –&gt; 00:34:07,759<br>2 plus 1 plus 5.</p>
<p>618<br>00:34:07,759 –&gt; 00:34:09,920<br>So it’ll be a very slight modification</p>
<p>619<br>00:34:09,920 –&gt; 00:34:12,039<br>to the code that we just looked at.</p>
<p>620<br>00:34:12,039 –&gt; 00:34:15,720<br>And here it is online, 70-ish.</p>
<p>621<br>00:34:15,720 –&gt; 00:34:17,920<br>So think about the base case.</p>
<p>622<br>00:34:17,920 –&gt; 00:34:21,039<br>If you have a list with one element in it, what do you return?</p>
<p>623<br>00:34:21,039 –&gt; 00:34:22,760<br>And if you have a list with many elements,</p>
<p>624<br>00:34:22,760 –&gt; 00:34:24,280<br>how can you put your trust in something</p>
<p>625<br>00:34:24,280 –&gt; 00:34:29,599<br>that you just wrote to help you get to the answer?</p>
<p>626<br>00:34:29,599 –&gt; 00:34:31,599<br>All right, what do you guys have for me?</p>
<p>627<br>00:34:31,599 –&gt; 00:34:34,840<br>So let’s start with the base case.</p>
<p>628<br>00:34:34,840 –&gt; 00:34:36,680<br>And if you’re having trouble, I encourage you</p>
<p>629<br>00:34:36,680 –&gt; 00:34:39,760<br>to just in a little comment, just write down</p>
<p>630<br>00:34:39,760 –&gt; 00:34:42,039<br>sort of what that base case looks like, right?</p>
<p>631<br>00:34:42,039 –&gt; 00:34:43,440<br>Like I did in the slides.</p>
<p>632<br>00:34:43,440 –&gt; 00:34:45,400<br>It looks like this.</p>
<p>633<br>00:34:45,400 –&gt; 00:34:49,120<br>So what would I return if I have a list with one element in it?</p>
<p>634<br>00:34:49,120 –&gt; 00:34:50,120<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>635<br>00:34:53,280 –&gt; 00:34:55,079<br>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>636<br>00:34:55,079 –&gt; 00:34:57,480<br>So we would turn the length of that element, right?</p>
<p>637<br>00:34:57,480 –&gt; 00:35:01,360<br>So the length of whatever this is, a, b, whatever.</p>
<p>638<br>00:35:01,360 –&gt; 00:35:02,519<br>Awesome.</p>
<p>639<br>00:35:02,519 –&gt; 00:35:04,079<br>How do we do the recursive step?</p>
<p>640<br>00:35:06,840 –&gt; 00:35:07,360<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>641<br>00:35:14,199 –&gt; 00:35:15,800<br>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>642<br>00:35:15,800 –&gt; 00:35:20,800<br>Total, land, recur, with what list?</p>
<p>643<br>00:35:24,559 –&gt; 00:35:26,239<br>Yep, so we’re going to extract that first one.</p>
<p>644<br>00:35:26,239 –&gt; 00:35:29,719<br>So this will give us some of the links of everybody else.</p>
<p>645<br>00:35:32,840 –&gt; 00:35:33,400<br>Exactly.</p>
<p>646<br>00:35:33,400 –&gt; 00:35:40,039<br>So we also need to add it to, yeah, L, C, right?</p>
<p>647<br>00:35:40,039 –&gt; 00:35:42,360<br>So it’s fine to do it even before or after,</p>
<p>648<br>00:35:42,360 –&gt; 00:35:43,960<br>because we’re just summing these two values.</p>
<p>649<br>00:35:43,960 –&gt; 00:35:45,960<br>So does it matter if you’re the order</p>
<p>650<br>00:35:45,960 –&gt; 00:35:48,159<br>that you’re summing them?</p>
<p>651<br>00:35:48,159 –&gt; 00:35:50,599<br>So that’s perfect.</p>
<p>652<br>00:35:50,599 –&gt; 00:35:52,039<br>Any questions about this code?</p>
<p>653<br>00:35:55,119 –&gt; 00:35:56,800<br>Yes, all right.</p>
<p>654<br>00:35:56,800 –&gt; 00:36:19,039<br>So in terms of efficiency, this function will be slightly less</p>
<p>655<br>00:36:19,039 –&gt; 00:36:21,000<br>efficient, I would say.</p>
<p>656<br>00:36:21,000 –&gt; 00:36:25,200<br>Yeah, because there’s a little overhead in actually making a function</p>
<p>657<br>00:36:25,199 –&gt; 00:36:29,000<br>called, whereas if you use a built-in operator,</p>
<p>658<br>00:36:29,000 –&gt; 00:36:32,719<br>it’s been optimized to work pretty fast.</p>
<p>659<br>00:36:32,719 –&gt; 00:36:33,239<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>660<br>00:36:33,239 –&gt; 00:36:34,399<br>I thought it was pretty good.</p>
<p>661<br>00:36:34,399 –&gt; 00:36:37,519<br>That’s equals, you’re not doing the piece of the button.</p>
<p>662<br>00:36:37,519 –&gt; 00:36:38,039<br>No.</p>
<p>663<br>00:36:38,039 –&gt; 00:36:39,960<br>And when it’s doing plus equals, it’s definitely</p>
<p>664<br>00:36:39,960 –&gt; 00:36:42,039<br>not doing this in the background, exactly.</p>
<p>665<br>00:36:42,039 –&gt; 00:36:43,239<br>Yep.</p>
<p>666<br>00:36:43,239 –&gt; 00:36:46,559<br>But this is just, I mean, where I’m trying</p>
<p>667<br>00:36:46,559 –&gt; 00:36:49,599<br>to show your recursion on something</p>
<p>668<br>00:36:49,599 –&gt; 00:36:52,799<br>that you wouldn’t typically use recursion on just</p>
<p>669<br>00:36:52,800 –&gt; 00:36:56,039<br>to help illustrate the idea of recursion.</p>
<p>670<br>00:36:56,039 –&gt; 00:36:58,039<br>Certainly, you can use an iterative algorithm,</p>
<p>671<br>00:36:58,039 –&gt; 00:37:00,720<br>obviously, to calculate the sum of these elements.</p>
<p>672<br>00:37:00,720 –&gt; 00:37:02,400<br>And it’s more intuitive, more in line</p>
<p>673<br>00:37:02,400 –&gt; 00:37:03,840<br>with what we’ve been learning so far.</p>
<p>674<br>00:37:07,080 –&gt; 00:37:08,080<br>OK.</p>
<p>675<br>00:37:11,039 –&gt; 00:37:11,720<br>Excellent.</p>
<p>676<br>00:37:11,720 –&gt; 00:37:17,760<br>So now let’s look at a slightly different problem.</p>
<p>677<br>00:37:17,760 –&gt; 00:37:21,039<br>So instead of finding the sum of all the elements in a list,</p>
<p>678<br>00:37:21,039 –&gt; 00:37:23,079<br>let’s tackle the problem of looking</p>
<p>679<br>00:37:23,079 –&gt; 00:37:24,599<br>for an element in a list.</p>
<p>680<br>00:37:24,599 –&gt; 00:37:26,519<br>I can completely different, but we’re still doing some sort</p>
<p>681<br>00:37:26,519 –&gt; 00:37:28,960<br>of list operations.</p>
<p>682<br>00:37:28,960 –&gt; 00:37:31,639<br>We’re going to start with an implementation that’s not quite</p>
<p>683<br>00:37:31,639 –&gt; 00:37:32,480<br>right.</p>
<p>684<br>00:37:32,480 –&gt; 00:37:34,679<br>And you will see why in a little bit.</p>
<p>685<br>00:37:34,679 –&gt; 00:37:37,039<br>So let’s follow the same sort of pattern</p>
<p>686<br>00:37:37,039 –&gt; 00:37:38,599<br>that we’ve seen in the previous one.</p>
<p>687<br>00:37:38,599 –&gt; 00:37:42,639<br>So let’s consider a list of length 1.</p>
<p>688<br>00:37:42,639 –&gt; 00:37:46,440<br>In this particular case, if I have a list with only one element</p>
<p>689<br>00:37:46,440 –&gt; 00:37:50,239<br>in it, how do I know if that element is the one I’m looking for?</p>
<p>690<br>00:37:50,239 –&gt; 00:37:53,839<br>Well, I’m just going to return this Boolean, right?</p>
<p>691<br>00:37:53,839 –&gt; 00:37:57,479<br>Whether L at index 0, that element is the one I’m looking for,</p>
<p>692<br>00:37:57,479 –&gt; 00:38:02,079<br>the E. So notice this in list is passing in the list itself</p>
<p>693<br>00:38:02,079 –&gt; 00:38:04,039<br>and the element I’m looking for.</p>
<p>694<br>00:38:04,039 –&gt; 00:38:05,039<br>OK.</p>
<p>695<br>00:38:12,879 –&gt; 00:38:16,919<br>So then let’s look at the recursive step.</p>
<p>696<br>00:38:16,919 –&gt; 00:38:18,919<br>The recursive step, in this particular case,</p>
<p>697<br>00:38:18,920 –&gt; 00:38:22,400<br>let’s say it says, well, L’s, right?</p>
<p>698<br>00:38:22,400 –&gt; 00:38:26,400<br>We might think to say, well, if it’s not the one I’m looking for,</p>
<p>699<br>00:38:26,400 –&gt; 00:38:29,360<br>then let’s look at the remainder of the list.</p>
<p>700<br>00:38:29,360 –&gt; 00:38:31,760<br>So like we did in the previous case,</p>
<p>701<br>00:38:31,760 –&gt; 00:38:35,280<br>let’s apply the same function we’re writing right now</p>
<p>702<br>00:38:35,280 –&gt; 00:38:38,280<br>to all the elements except for the first one.</p>
<p>703<br>00:38:38,280 –&gt; 00:38:42,360<br>And we’re still looking for element E in those remaining</p>
<p>704<br>00:38:42,360 –&gt; 00:38:44,280<br>elements.</p>
<p>705<br>00:38:44,280 –&gt; 00:38:45,480<br>OK.</p>
<p>706<br>00:38:45,480 –&gt; 00:38:47,240<br>So we can test it out.</p>
<p>707<br>00:38:47,239 –&gt; 00:38:48,879<br>And if we actually run it again, please,</p>
<p>708<br>00:38:48,879 –&gt; 00:38:50,599<br>I encourage you to do Python to run your own.</p>
<p>709<br>00:38:50,599 –&gt; 00:38:55,039<br>But we can test it out and say, if we</p>
<p>710<br>00:38:55,039 –&gt; 00:38:59,199<br>in this particular case, 2581, if I actually run this code,</p>
<p>711<br>00:38:59,199 –&gt; 00:39:00,159<br>it will give me true.</p>
<p>712<br>00:39:00,159 –&gt; 00:39:06,799<br>So it found the one inside the list 2581, which is good.</p>
<p>713<br>00:39:06,799 –&gt; 00:39:09,079<br>It’s exactly what we wanted.</p>
<p>714<br>00:39:09,079 –&gt; 00:39:12,399<br>But if I change my input list slightly, right?</p>
<p>715<br>00:39:12,399 –&gt; 00:39:16,279<br>And I’ve got to 158, the element I’m looking for is here.</p>
<p>716<br>00:39:17,239 –&gt; 00:39:20,319<br>The code will actually give me false, the one that I just wrote,</p>
<p>717<br>00:39:20,319 –&gt; 00:39:21,399<br>which is not OK.</p>
<p>718<br>00:39:21,399 –&gt; 00:39:23,159<br>I see the one is right over there.</p>
<p>719<br>00:39:25,959 –&gt; 00:39:28,159<br>And so what exactly is going on?</p>
<p>720<br>00:39:28,159 –&gt; 00:39:33,439<br>So we can run the code here.</p>
<p>721<br>00:39:33,439 –&gt; 00:39:36,839<br>So this is this code here.</p>
<p>722<br>00:39:36,839 –&gt; 00:39:38,839<br>If you see that, it gives you the incorrect value.</p>
<p>723<br>00:39:38,839 –&gt; 00:39:40,639<br>One thing you could do when you’re doing recursion</p>
<p>724<br>00:39:40,639 –&gt; 00:39:45,359<br>is to put a print statement within the function itself.</p>
<p>725<br>00:39:45,360 –&gt; 00:39:48,840<br>So we can print maybe the list we’re currently at,</p>
<p>726<br>00:39:48,840 –&gt; 00:39:50,920<br>and the element we’re looking for,</p>
<p>727<br>00:39:50,920 –&gt; 00:39:52,559<br>and see exactly what’s going on.</p>
<p>728<br>00:39:52,559 –&gt; 00:39:56,120<br>So if I run it, it will say, well, first time</p>
<p>729<br>00:39:56,120 –&gt; 00:39:59,800<br>through the function call, I’m looking for the number one</p>
<p>730<br>00:39:59,800 –&gt; 00:40:01,200<br>in this list.</p>
<p>731<br>00:40:01,200 –&gt; 00:40:03,960<br>The next time I’m looking for the one in this list,</p>
<p>732<br>00:40:03,960 –&gt; 00:40:07,519<br>the next time I’m looking for the one in this list,</p>
<p>733<br>00:40:07,519 –&gt; 00:40:09,840<br>and the last time for my function call,</p>
<p>734<br>00:40:09,840 –&gt; 00:40:13,840<br>I’m looking for the one in this list.</p>
<p>735<br>00:40:13,840 –&gt; 00:40:16,240<br>And already we see something went wrong,</p>
<p>736<br>00:40:16,240 –&gt; 00:40:21,079<br>because as I was looking through these lists,</p>
<p>737<br>00:40:21,079 –&gt; 00:40:26,559<br>I’m basically skipping over important elements.</p>
<p>738<br>00:40:26,559 –&gt; 00:40:30,160<br>What this code is actually doing is only checking</p>
<p>739<br>00:40:30,160 –&gt; 00:40:34,760<br>if the last element is the one you’re looking for.</p>
<p>740<br>00:40:34,760 –&gt; 00:40:39,640<br>Because it basically ignores that first element in the code.</p>
<p>741<br>00:40:39,640 –&gt; 00:40:43,440<br>The code here, yes, it extracts that first element,</p>
<p>742<br>00:40:43,440 –&gt; 00:40:44,920<br>but it doesn’t do anything with it.</p>
<p>743<br>00:40:48,119 –&gt; 00:40:50,679<br>So that’s our problem.</p>
<p>744<br>00:40:50,679 –&gt; 00:40:54,000<br>What we want to do is still look at further elements</p>
<p>745<br>00:40:54,000 –&gt; 00:40:56,679<br>in the list, so that part of the code is correct.</p>
<p>746<br>00:40:56,679 –&gt; 00:40:59,599<br>But we only want to do it in a certain situation.</p>
<p>747<br>00:40:59,599 –&gt; 00:41:04,360<br>And that situation is when the element that we just extracted,</p>
<p>748<br>00:41:04,360 –&gt; 00:41:08,880<br>L at index 0, is not the one we’re looking for.</p>
<p>749<br>00:41:08,880 –&gt; 00:41:12,000<br>That little else case.</p>
<p>750<br>00:41:12,000 –&gt; 00:41:14,599<br>So we still want to extract the first element</p>
<p>751<br>00:41:14,599 –&gt; 00:41:17,760<br>if we have a list with more than one element in it.</p>
<p>752<br>00:41:17,760 –&gt; 00:41:22,239<br>But as we’ve extracted it, check if it’s the one we’re looking for.</p>
<p>753<br>00:41:22,239 –&gt; 00:41:24,960<br>If it is returned true, no need to keep searching</p>
<p>754<br>00:41:24,960 –&gt; 00:41:27,159<br>the rest of the elements in the list.</p>
<p>755<br>00:41:27,159 –&gt; 00:41:30,480<br>If it’s not the one we’re looking for, this else here,</p>
<p>756<br>00:41:30,480 –&gt; 00:41:33,679<br>then we can look at the remaining elements in the list</p>
<p>757<br>00:41:33,679 –&gt; 00:41:35,880<br>and run the exact same function we’re writing,</p>
<p>758<br>00:41:35,880 –&gt; 00:41:40,000<br>to check if the elements is in the remaining list.</p>
<p>759<br>00:41:40,000 –&gt; 00:41:41,199<br>Does this code make sense?</p>
<p>760<br>00:41:41,199 –&gt; 00:41:42,639<br>Is it all right?</p>
<p>761<br>00:41:42,639 –&gt; 00:41:44,800<br>OK.</p>
<p>762<br>00:41:44,800 –&gt; 00:41:48,599<br>So the way I wrote this code is sort of how I personally</p>
<p>763<br>00:41:48,599 –&gt; 00:41:50,840<br>think about the problem.</p>
<p>764<br>00:41:50,840 –&gt; 00:41:53,719<br>And if we run the code again, it’ll give me</p>
<p>765<br>00:41:53,719 –&gt; 00:41:55,480<br>the correct answers each time.</p>
<p>766<br>00:41:55,480 –&gt; 00:41:58,039<br>But I wanted to mention that we can actually</p>
<p>767<br>00:41:58,039 –&gt; 00:41:59,800<br>clean up the code a little bit and write it</p>
<p>768<br>00:41:59,800 –&gt; 00:42:04,000<br>a little bit more pisonically.</p>
<p>769<br>00:42:04,000 –&gt; 00:42:07,079<br>So it’s a little bit nicer to read.</p>
<p>770<br>00:42:07,079 –&gt; 00:42:08,039<br>It’s more cleaned up.</p>
<p>771<br>00:42:08,039 –&gt; 00:42:11,800<br>But one of the things that was confusing for me</p>
<p>772<br>00:42:11,800 –&gt; 00:42:13,639<br>when I first started learning recursion</p>
<p>773<br>00:42:13,639 –&gt; 00:42:18,199<br>is that I would always see these beautiful, cleaned up versions</p>
<p>774<br>00:42:18,199 –&gt; 00:42:21,639<br>of code that do the recursion.</p>
<p>775<br>00:42:21,639 –&gt; 00:42:25,719<br>And that’s not sort of how we approach thinking about the problem.</p>
<p>776<br>00:42:25,719 –&gt; 00:42:29,440<br>I can’t come up with this nice form right off the bat.</p>
<p>777<br>00:42:29,440 –&gt; 00:42:32,119<br>And this is one example, but there are certainly other examples</p>
<p>778<br>00:42:32,119 –&gt; 00:42:34,039<br>of more complicated code where you see it,</p>
<p>779<br>00:42:34,039 –&gt; 00:42:35,599<br>and it looks beautiful.</p>
<p>780<br>00:42:35,599 –&gt; 00:42:38,000<br>And yes, if I look at it, I can figure it out.</p>
<p>781<br>00:42:38,000 –&gt; 00:42:39,719<br>And I say, OK, yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>782<br>00:42:39,719 –&gt; 00:42:43,079<br>But I personally could never come up with it on my own.</p>
<p>783<br>00:42:43,079 –&gt; 00:42:44,719<br>So I was writing these lectures.</p>
<p>784<br>00:42:44,719 –&gt; 00:42:47,360<br>I thought, well, how do I actually think about the problem?</p>
<p>785<br>00:42:47,360 –&gt; 00:42:49,199<br>So I just went back one slide.</p>
<p>786<br>00:42:49,199 –&gt; 00:42:50,880<br>And the way I think about the problem</p>
<p>787<br>00:42:50,880 –&gt; 00:42:56,840<br>is to kind of separate it into a bunch of different base cases,</p>
<p>788<br>00:42:56,840 –&gt; 00:42:58,679<br>or a bunch of different cases.</p>
<p>789<br>00:42:58,679 –&gt; 00:43:00,960<br>And so that’s what I’ve been trying to do in this particular</p>
<p>790<br>00:43:00,960 –&gt; 00:43:02,800<br>lecture to help you guys understand recursion.</p>
<p>791<br>00:43:02,800 –&gt; 00:43:05,760<br>It’s, think about the case when we have a list with one</p>
<p>792<br>00:43:05,760 –&gt; 00:43:07,519<br>element in it.</p>
<p>793<br>00:43:07,519 –&gt; 00:43:09,440<br>How would you solve that problem?</p>
<p>794<br>00:43:09,440 –&gt; 00:43:10,759<br>And then think about the case when</p>
<p>795<br>00:43:10,759 –&gt; 00:43:12,079<br>you have a list with many elements in it.</p>
<p>796<br>00:43:12,079 –&gt; 00:43:14,519<br>How would you solve that problem?</p>
<p>797<br>00:43:14,519 –&gt; 00:43:15,440<br>Yes, it’s true.</p>
<p>798<br>00:43:15,440 –&gt; 00:43:18,880<br>There are some pieces here that are repeating.</p>
<p>799<br>00:43:18,880 –&gt; 00:43:23,039<br>So we’ve got L at 0 equal E is in a couple places.</p>
<p>800<br>00:43:23,039 –&gt; 00:43:25,519<br>But you can do that clean up later.</p>
<p>801<br>00:43:25,519 –&gt; 00:43:28,800<br>So here I’ve got two test cases that return 2 cases that</p>
<p>802<br>00:43:28,800 –&gt; 00:43:32,559<br>return L at 0, so we can pop them into the same test case</p>
<p>803<br>00:43:32,559 –&gt; 00:43:33,320<br>here.</p>
<p>804<br>00:43:33,320 –&gt; 00:43:35,880<br>And then we can check if the length of the list is 0.</p>
<p>805<br>00:43:35,880 –&gt; 00:43:38,320<br>We can add that test case and else we check the remainder</p>
<p>806<br>00:43:38,320 –&gt; 00:43:39,519<br>of the list.</p>
<p>807<br>00:43:39,519 –&gt; 00:43:40,599<br>That’s totally fine.</p>
<p>808<br>00:43:40,599 –&gt; 00:43:42,760<br>And if it helps you think about the problem this way,</p>
<p>809<br>00:43:42,760 –&gt; 00:43:44,200<br>that’s OK.</p>
<p>810<br>00:43:44,200 –&gt; 00:43:44,880<br>2.</p>
<p>811<br>00:43:44,880 –&gt; 00:43:46,640<br>But personally, for me, it was a lot easier</p>
<p>812<br>00:43:46,640 –&gt; 00:43:49,360<br>to think about the problem in terms of a list with one element</p>
<p>813<br>00:43:49,360 –&gt; 00:43:52,320<br>in it, and then a list with many elements in it.</p>
<p>814<br>00:43:52,320 –&gt; 00:43:55,960<br>But it’s totally fine to write a little bit</p>
<p>815<br>00:43:55,960 –&gt; 00:44:00,599<br>quote unquote inefficient looking code to begin.</p>
<p>816<br>00:44:00,599 –&gt; 00:44:02,720<br>Certainly don’t hard code all the base cases.</p>
<p>817<br>00:44:02,720 –&gt; 00:44:04,119<br>If length is 0, do this.</p>
<p>818<br>00:44:04,119 –&gt; 00:44:05,320<br>If length is 1, do this.</p>
<p>819<br>00:44:05,320 –&gt; 00:44:07,360<br>If length is 2, do this.</p>
<p>820<br>00:44:07,360 –&gt; 00:44:10,720<br>But some reasonable base cases are OK to do.</p>
<p>821<br>00:44:10,720 –&gt; 00:44:14,600<br>So this is just showing the simplified code.</p>
<p>822<br>00:44:14,600 –&gt; 00:44:16,320<br>One thing that I wanted to mention,</p>
<p>823<br>00:44:16,320 –&gt; 00:44:18,680<br>and hopefully you’ve noticed this already,</p>
<p>824<br>00:44:18,680 –&gt; 00:44:21,960<br>is the function that you’re writing,</p>
<p>825<br>00:44:21,960 –&gt; 00:44:25,240<br>all of the returns from this function</p>
<p>826<br>00:44:25,240 –&gt; 00:44:28,080<br>need to have the same type.</p>
<p>827<br>00:44:28,080 –&gt; 00:44:30,720<br>When we wrote, I’ll go back a couple slides.</p>
<p>828<br>00:44:30,720 –&gt; 00:44:33,400<br>When we wrote the function that calculated the sum of all</p>
<p>829<br>00:44:33,400 –&gt; 00:44:35,039<br>the elements in the list.</p>
<p>830<br>00:44:35,039 –&gt; 00:44:37,759<br>So that’s this one here.</p>
<p>831<br>00:44:37,759 –&gt; 00:44:38,920<br>What were we returning?</p>
<p>832<br>00:44:38,920 –&gt; 00:44:41,400<br>Here, we were returning an actual number.</p>
<p>833<br>00:44:41,400 –&gt; 00:44:44,039<br>And then here, we were assuming that this function</p>
<p>834<br>00:44:44,039 –&gt; 00:44:48,320<br>returned an actual number that we can add to this actual number.</p>
<p>835<br>00:44:48,320 –&gt; 00:44:50,920<br>So every single return statement needs</p>
<p>836<br>00:44:50,920 –&gt; 00:44:53,800<br>to return the same type of object.</p>
<p>837<br>00:44:53,800 –&gt; 00:44:59,000<br>Because if you’re assuming that the base case returns a list,</p>
<p>838<br>00:44:59,000 –&gt; 00:45:00,840<br>but then at some point in the code,</p>
<p>839<br>00:45:00,840 –&gt; 00:45:05,000<br>you’re going to be working with a number or a Boolean.</p>
<p>840<br>00:45:05,000 –&gt; 00:45:07,039<br>Then Python, as soon as it gets that base case,</p>
<p>841<br>00:45:07,039 –&gt; 00:45:09,559<br>is going to say, hey, you’re trying to add a Boolean to a list.</p>
<p>842<br>00:45:09,559 –&gt; 00:45:11,360<br>What’s up?</p>
<p>843<br>00:45:11,360 –&gt; 00:45:14,280<br>And so in the summing of the list elements,</p>
<p>844<br>00:45:14,280 –&gt; 00:45:17,559<br>all the test cases returned a number.</p>
<p>845<br>00:45:17,559 –&gt; 00:45:19,639<br>And in this case, where we are trying</p>
<p>846<br>00:45:19,639 –&gt; 00:45:22,840<br>to return the, whether the element is in a list or not,</p>
<p>847<br>00:45:22,840 –&gt; 00:45:25,480<br>notice every single one of my returns</p>
<p>848<br>00:45:25,480 –&gt; 00:45:26,840<br>is going to return a Boolean.</p>
<p>849<br>00:45:26,840 –&gt; 00:45:31,039<br>So here, Boolean, here, Boolean, and here in the recursive step,</p>
<p>850<br>00:45:31,039 –&gt; 00:45:33,719<br>I’m assuming that I’m just passing this Boolean back up</p>
<p>851<br>00:45:33,719 –&gt; 00:45:35,639<br>the chain of command.</p>
<p>852<br>00:45:35,639 –&gt; 00:45:37,439<br>So a very, very important thing.</p>
<p>853<br>00:45:37,439 –&gt; 00:45:39,839<br>Again, something that was not made clear to me</p>
<p>854<br>00:45:39,839 –&gt; 00:45:41,519<br>when I first started recursion.</p>
<p>855<br>00:45:41,519 –&gt; 00:45:45,359<br>But once I knew this, it just made so much more sense</p>
<p>856<br>00:45:45,359 –&gt; 00:45:49,480<br>and it helped me write my code better, more perfectly,</p>
<p>857<br>00:45:49,480 –&gt; 00:45:51,799<br>right off the bat.</p>
<p>858<br>00:45:51,799 –&gt; 00:45:53,879<br>Let’s look at a slightly different example now.</p>
<p>859<br>00:45:53,879 –&gt; 00:45:56,559<br>So we’ve looked at taking the sum of all the elements</p>
<p>860<br>00:45:56,559 –&gt; 00:45:57,199<br>in the list.</p>
<p>861<br>00:45:57,199 –&gt; 00:45:59,799<br>We’ve looked at figuring out whether an element is in the list.</p>
<p>862<br>00:45:59,799 –&gt; 00:46:02,759<br>Let’s do something completely different.</p>
<p>863<br>00:46:02,760 –&gt; 00:46:04,320<br>Still working with lists.</p>
<p>864<br>00:46:04,320 –&gt; 00:46:08,560<br>Let’s say that we now have an input list that looks like this.</p>
<p>865<br>00:46:08,560 –&gt; 00:46:10,080<br>So we’ve got a list.</p>
<p>866<br>00:46:10,080 –&gt; 00:46:14,120<br>This is my list beginning an end.</p>
<p>867<br>00:46:14,120 –&gt; 00:46:18,080<br>And this list only has list elements within it.</p>
<p>868<br>00:46:18,080 –&gt; 00:46:21,600<br>So no integers, but its elements are lists.</p>
<p>869<br>00:46:21,600 –&gt; 00:46:23,160<br>So here’s one list element.</p>
<p>870<br>00:46:23,160 –&gt; 00:46:24,960<br>Here’s another list element.</p>
<p>871<br>00:46:24,960 –&gt; 00:46:27,960<br>And here’s another list element.</p>
<p>872<br>00:46:27,960 –&gt; 00:46:31,920<br>So in this example, I’ve got a list with three list elements.</p>
<p>873<br>00:46:32,920 –&gt; 00:46:36,400<br>What I’d like to do is to flatten this list, which</p>
<p>874<br>00:46:36,400 –&gt; 00:46:41,240<br>means that I want to remove any semblance of sublists</p>
<p>875<br>00:46:41,240 –&gt; 00:46:45,080<br>and take just all the elements of the sublists</p>
<p>876<br>00:46:45,080 –&gt; 00:46:46,800<br>and put them top level.</p>
<p>877<br>00:46:50,360 –&gt; 00:46:53,480<br>Does this task make sense?</p>
<p>878<br>00:46:53,480 –&gt; 00:46:54,640<br>OK.</p>
<p>879<br>00:46:54,640 –&gt; 00:46:57,360<br>So I’m not assuming I’ve got lists within lists.</p>
<p>880<br>00:46:57,360 –&gt; 00:47:00,720<br>I’m just assuming I’ve got lists with list elements that</p>
<p>881<br>00:47:00,719 –&gt; 00:47:04,319<br>have integers or whatever.</p>
<p>882<br>00:47:04,319 –&gt; 00:47:05,439<br>OK.</p>
<p>883<br>00:47:05,439 –&gt; 00:47:08,679<br>So again, let’s think about the base case.</p>
<p>884<br>00:47:08,679 –&gt; 00:47:11,159<br>Let’s think about the case when we have a list with one</p>
<p>885<br>00:47:11,159 –&gt; 00:47:12,239<br>element in it.</p>
<p>886<br>00:47:12,239 –&gt; 00:47:15,279<br>And then we can figure out the recursive step.</p>
<p>887<br>00:47:15,279 –&gt; 00:47:17,399<br>So if I have a list with one element in it,</p>
<p>888<br>00:47:17,399 –&gt; 00:47:20,279<br>again, I’ve got an example here on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>889<br>00:47:20,279 –&gt; 00:47:24,239<br>It’s a list with one list element in it.</p>
<p>890<br>00:47:24,239 –&gt; 00:47:27,199<br>That’s why I’ve got the double square brackets.</p>
<p>891<br>00:47:27,199 –&gt; 00:47:30,279<br>If I wanted to flatten this, what could I do?</p>
<p>892<br>00:47:31,719 –&gt; 00:47:35,159<br>I could just grab the element at index 0.</p>
<p>893<br>00:47:35,159 –&gt; 00:47:39,039<br>Because the element at index 0 is this inner list,</p>
<p>894<br>00:47:39,039 –&gt; 00:47:42,359<br>and it is a flattened version of my list.</p>
<p>895<br>00:47:46,839 –&gt; 00:47:48,879<br>Else, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>896<br>00:47:48,879 –&gt; 00:47:50,519<br>Well, let’s do the same pattern.</p>
<p>897<br>00:47:50,519 –&gt; 00:47:52,879<br>It seems to have worked so far for us.</p>
<p>898<br>00:47:52,879 –&gt; 00:47:56,039<br>Let’s do the pattern of extracting that first element.</p>
<p>899<br>00:47:56,039 –&gt; 00:47:58,799<br>So grab element at index 0.</p>
<p>900<br>00:47:58,880 –&gt; 00:48:04,880<br>So here, we would grab something like square brackets 1, 2,</p>
<p>901<br>00:48:04,880 –&gt; 00:48:08,120<br>and concatenate it with something.</p>
<p>902<br>00:48:08,120 –&gt; 00:48:10,960<br>Remember, when we concatenate a list with another list,</p>
<p>903<br>00:48:10,960 –&gt; 00:48:13,920<br>it gives us a big list with all the elements in it.</p>
<p>904<br>00:48:13,920 –&gt; 00:48:15,600<br>Exactly what we’re looking for, right,</p>
<p>905<br>00:48:15,600 –&gt; 00:48:17,960<br>when we want to flatten a list.</p>
<p>906<br>00:48:17,960 –&gt; 00:48:24,320<br>So the something we’re going to add this L at index 0 with is</p>
<p>907<br>00:48:24,760 –&gt; 00:48:28,960<br>just us flattening the remainder of our list.</p>
<p>908<br>00:48:28,960 –&gt; 00:48:32,519<br>Again, same pattern we’ve been seeing already, right?</p>
<p>909<br>00:48:32,519 –&gt; 00:48:34,680<br>So if I extract, in this example here,</p>
<p>910<br>00:48:34,680 –&gt; 00:48:39,920<br>the 1, 2 as a list, I’m going to concatenate it with the</p>
<p>911<br>00:48:39,920 –&gt; 00:48:42,440<br>assumption that the function I’m writing will work</p>
<p>912<br>00:48:42,440 –&gt; 00:48:47,320<br>correctly to flatten 3, 4, and 9, 8, 7.</p>
<p>913<br>00:48:47,320 –&gt; 00:48:51,120<br>So if I flatten that, this will give me just a list with</p>
<p>914<br>00:48:51,120 –&gt; 00:48:53,840<br>3, 4, 9, 8, 7, all to fit it.</p>
<p>915<br>00:48:53,840 –&gt; 00:48:57,120<br>And if I concatenate 1, 2 with 3, 4, 9, 8, 7, that just</p>
<p>916<br>00:48:57,120 –&gt; 00:48:58,640<br>gives me 3, 4, 9, 8, 7.</p>
<p>917<br>00:49:01,600 –&gt; 00:49:03,600<br>Everyone with me is that all right?</p>
<p>918<br>00:49:03,600 –&gt; 00:49:04,079<br>OK, good.</p>
<p>919<br>00:49:04,079 –&gt; 00:49:06,880<br>I see some nods, so that’s actually pretty good sign.</p>
<p>920<br>00:49:06,880 –&gt; 00:49:07,400<br>OK.</p>
<p>921<br>00:49:10,079 –&gt; 00:49:11,800<br>You are with me, right?</p>
<p>922<br>00:49:11,800 –&gt; 00:49:14,320<br>Because now it is your turn.</p>
<p>923<br>00:49:14,320 –&gt; 00:49:20,000<br>So we’re going to write a variation of whether an</p>
<p>924<br>00:49:20,000 –&gt; 00:49:22,160<br>element is in a list.</p>
<p>925<br>00:49:22,159 –&gt; 00:49:25,119<br>So I’m going to give you a very similar scenario to this</p>
<p>926<br>00:49:25,119 –&gt; 00:49:25,879<br>flatten one.</p>
<p>927<br>00:49:25,879 –&gt; 00:49:29,879<br>So I’m going to give you a list that contains list elements.</p>
<p>928<br>00:49:29,879 –&gt; 00:49:31,480<br>So here’s my list.</p>
<p>929<br>00:49:31,480 –&gt; 00:49:34,239<br>That contains list elements in it.</p>
<p>930<br>00:49:34,239 –&gt; 00:49:37,599<br>And what I’d like you to do is write a recursive function</p>
<p>931<br>00:49:37,599 –&gt; 00:49:41,000<br>that checks whether this element, whatever the second</p>
<p>932<br>00:49:41,000 –&gt; 00:49:47,079<br>parameter of the function call is in these list elements.</p>
<p>933<br>00:49:47,079 –&gt; 00:49:50,719<br>So not at the top level, like we wrote the last code to</p>
<p>934<br>00:49:50,719 –&gt; 00:49:53,079<br>check if an element is in the list.</p>
<p>935<br>00:49:53,079 –&gt; 00:49:58,599<br>But in these sublists, just to show you the difference,</p>
<p>936<br>00:49:58,599 –&gt; 00:50:04,319<br>if I check whether 3 is in 1, 2, 3, that will be true.</p>
<p>937<br>00:50:04,319 –&gt; 00:50:08,839<br>But if I check whether 3 is in the list containing the list</p>
<p>938<br>00:50:08,839 –&gt; 00:50:12,319<br>1, 2, 3, that’s false, because it’s checking whether the</p>
<p>939<br>00:50:12,319 –&gt; 00:50:14,959<br>3 is equal to this list.</p>
<p>940<br>00:50:14,959 –&gt; 00:50:17,519<br>It’s just doing a top level equality here.</p>
<p>941<br>00:50:18,519 –&gt; 00:50:25,759<br>So let’s have you write this code down online 166.</p>
<p>942<br>00:50:25,759 –&gt; 00:50:31,280<br>You may use the inoperator to check if an element is in a</p>
<p>943<br>00:50:31,280 –&gt; 00:50:32,159<br>list itself.</p>
<p>944<br>00:50:32,159 –&gt; 00:50:35,519<br>But obviously, you won’t be able to use the inoperator, nor</p>
<p>945<br>00:50:35,519 –&gt; 00:50:37,360<br>should you, because then we’re not writing a recursive</p>
<p>946<br>00:50:37,360 –&gt; 00:50:42,360<br>function, to check if the element is within a list element.</p>
<p>947<br>00:50:42,720 –&gt; 00:50:49,360<br>So have you worked on it for a couple minutes, and then we</p>
<p>948<br>00:50:49,360 –&gt; 00:50:51,360<br>can write it together.</p>
<p>949<br>00:50:51,360 –&gt; 00:50:54,360<br>All right, does anyone have a start?</p>
<p>950<br>00:50:54,360 –&gt; 00:50:58,360<br>So let’s look at the case where we have one element in it.</p>
<p>951<br>00:50:58,360 –&gt; 00:51:04,360<br>How do you check whether that element is within the list inside?</p>
<p>952<br>00:51:04,360 –&gt; 00:51:11,360<br>So if, this is our case with one element in the list.</p>
<p>953<br>00:51:12,360 –&gt; 00:51:18,360<br>The length of L equals 1.</p>
<p>954<br>00:51:18,360 –&gt; 00:51:21,360<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>955<br>00:51:21,360 –&gt; 00:51:30,360<br>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>956<br>00:51:30,360 –&gt; 00:51:37,360<br>E and L is the correct thing to do, L at index 0, right?</p>
<p>957<br>00:51:38,360 –&gt; 00:51:41,360<br>So if this is our L, that’s why I added this little example</p>
<p>958<br>00:51:41,360 –&gt; 00:51:43,360<br>here, so it can help us.</p>
<p>959<br>00:51:43,360 –&gt; 00:51:47,360<br>So L at index 0 is this guy here, and all I need to do is check</p>
<p>960<br>00:51:47,360 –&gt; 00:51:50,360<br>if E is in L at index 0.</p>
<p>961<br>00:51:50,360 –&gt; 00:51:57,360<br>And I can just return that right off the bat.</p>
<p>962<br>00:51:57,360 –&gt; 00:52:02,360<br>I could do if E in L 0 return true, Ls return false, but E in L 0</p>
<p>963<br>00:52:02,360 –&gt; 00:52:06,360<br>is already a Boolean, so I can just return that directly.</p>
<p>964<br>00:52:07,360 –&gt; 00:52:14,360<br>Okay, Ls, we have a list with more than one element in it, right?</p>
<p>965<br>00:52:15,360 –&gt; 00:52:19,360<br>So what do we do here?</p>
<p>966<br>00:52:19,360 –&gt; 00:52:26,360<br>Remember, extract the first element, and then do the rest.</p>
<p>967<br>00:52:30,360 –&gt; 00:52:32,360<br>So let’s say this.</p>
<p>968<br>00:52:32,360 –&gt; 00:52:35,360<br>Let’s say the first element is L at index 0, right?</p>
<p>969<br>00:52:35,360 –&gt; 00:52:40,360<br>Let’s help us think about it a little bit.</p>
<p>970<br>00:52:40,360 –&gt; 00:52:44,360<br>So before looking at the remainder of the list, right, and calling our recursive function,</p>
<p>971<br>00:52:44,360 –&gt; 00:52:49,360<br>what did we do when we checked if an element was in the list when we just had a plain list?</p>
<p>972<br>00:52:49,360 –&gt; 00:53:02,360<br>We just said if, you know, E is in first, return true, Ls return false, right?</p>
<p>973<br>00:53:06,360 –&gt; 00:53:12,360<br>But we don’t want to do else return false because that’s not quite true.</p>
<p>974<br>00:53:12,360 –&gt; 00:53:19,360<br>Ls, we want to look at the remainder of the list, right?</p>
<p>975<br>00:53:19,360 –&gt; 00:53:26,360<br>We want to see if the element, obviously, if the element is not in the first thing that I just extracted, right?</p>
<p>976<br>00:53:26,360 –&gt; 00:53:34,360<br>This list here, then I would like to say is it in the rest of this list?</p>
<p>977<br>00:53:35,360 –&gt; 00:53:39,360<br>Which is us calling the function that we’re just writing all over again.</p>
<p>978<br>00:53:39,360 –&gt; 00:53:50,360<br>So we can return the name of this function in lists of lists,</p>
<p>979<br>00:53:51,360 –&gt; 00:53:58,360<br>and then L from one onward with the same element we’re trying to find.</p>
<p>980<br>00:53:59,360 –&gt; 00:54:04,360<br>And of course, we can simplify this just like we could simplify the previous one,</p>
<p>981<br>00:54:04,360 –&gt; 00:54:12,360<br>but it helps to think about it in these two cases, a list with one element and a list with many elements.</p>
<p>982<br>00:54:12,360 –&gt; 00:54:21,360<br>Okay. Any questions about this? Yes.</p>
<p>983<br>00:54:29,360 –&gt; 00:54:35,360<br>This one? This one we’re considering a list with one list inside it.</p>
<p>984<br>00:54:35,360 –&gt; 00:54:45,360<br>Yeah. We could include another base case, I suppose, if the length of L is zero return false, that would also work.</p>
<p>985<br>00:54:45,360 –&gt; 00:54:50,360<br>Because obviously if the list is empty, then there’s, it’s not in there.</p>
<p>986<br>00:54:50,360 –&gt; 00:54:55,360<br>Okay. So what do we use recursion? Obviously, a lot of the examples we’ve seen here,</p>
<p>987<br>00:54:55,360 –&gt; 00:54:58,360<br>they’re very intuitive to write iteratively.</p>
<p>988<br>00:54:58,360 –&gt; 00:55:05,360<br>But I mentioned a couple examples last time, where it’s more intuitive to use recursion.</p>
<p>989<br>00:55:05,360 –&gt; 00:55:12,360<br>And specifically, I wanted to draw a little bit of a parallel to this thing when we learned about while loops.</p>
<p>990<br>00:55:12,360 –&gt; 00:55:17,360<br>We said, well, what if we tried to code a little game that just used if and else’s?</p>
<p>991<br>00:55:17,360 –&gt; 00:55:23,360<br>I said that we would have a bunch of nested if L statements, right, without a while loop.</p>
<p>992<br>00:55:23,360 –&gt; 00:55:29,360<br>Because we don’t know how deep to make these if, L, if, you know, if statements.</p>
<p>993<br>00:55:29,360 –&gt; 00:55:35,360<br>And so a very similar idea exists with recursion and when to use recursion.</p>
<p>994<br>00:55:35,360 –&gt; 00:55:41,360<br>So if I had a list where the whole bunch of lists in it and those lists could have lists within it and so on and so on,</p>
<p>995<br>00:55:41,360 –&gt; 00:55:47,360<br>I don’t know how long I need to, how deep I need to make my code go, right?</p>
<p>996<br>00:55:47,360 –&gt; 00:55:52,360<br>So an example using a for loop would be to say for each element in L.</p>
<p>997<br>00:55:52,360 –&gt; 00:55:55,360<br>Right? I’m going to say I’m going to look at each element.</p>
<p>998<br>00:55:55,360 –&gt; 00:55:59,360<br>I’m going to say, well, if you’re not a list, then I can deal with you directly.</p>
<p>999<br>00:55:59,360 –&gt; 00:56:03,360<br>But if you are a list, then I need to iterate over you.</p>
<p>1000<br>00:56:03,360 –&gt; 00:56:09,360<br>And so I’ve got this other iteration here for each j and i, right, from one of those lists.</p>
<p>1001<br>00:56:09,360 –&gt; 00:56:12,360<br>Again, I would say, are you a list? If not, I’ll deal with you directly.</p>
<p>1002<br>00:56:12,360 –&gt; 00:56:16,360<br>L, you are a list. So I do need to iterate over you.</p>
<p>1003<br>00:56:16,360 –&gt; 00:56:20,360<br>And you can see this nested idea now comes into play here.</p>
<p>1004<br>00:56:20,360 –&gt; 00:56:28,360<br>We could try to use a while loop to optimize the code a little bit, say, you know, while this element type is not a list to do this, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>1005<br>00:56:28,360 –&gt; 00:56:33,360<br>But it leads to some reliever, both and verbose code.</p>
<p>1006<br>00:56:33,360 –&gt; 00:56:38,360<br>And so recursion is a way for us to deal with these lists within lists within lists.</p>
<p>1007<br>00:56:38,360 –&gt; 00:56:43,360<br>And of course, when you have data structures that you don’t know how long, or how deep they go.</p>
<p>1008<br>00:56:43,360 –&gt; 00:56:46,360<br>So we’ve got a lot of things written in the list.</p>
<p>1009<br>00:56:46,360 –&gt; 00:56:50,360<br>And we’ve got a lot of data, a lot of things that are not mentioned, file systems, and a set of operations, last lecture has really nice places to use recursion.</p>
<p>1010<br>00:56:50,360 –&gt; 00:56:55,360<br>ScubiDue gang looking for, you know, their, their culprit.</p>
<p>1011<br>00:56:55,360 –&gt; 00:56:59,360<br>We don’t, rooms that have doors that lead to other rooms that have doors lead to other rooms.</p>
<p>1012<br>00:56:59,360 –&gt; 00:57:04,360<br>They don’t know how many doors they need to go through to get to a room without doors obviously recursion.</p>
<p>1013<br>00:57:04,360 –&gt; 00:57:09,360<br>They should use. And then a bunch of other fun examples of places to use recursion.</p>
<p>1014<br>00:57:09,360 –&gt; 00:57:17,760<br>bit of class, I would like to work through this example where we’re going to see the code</p>
<p>1015<br>00:57:17,760 –&gt; 00:57:22,000<br>to solve lists within lists within lists within lists.</p>
<p>1016<br>00:57:22,000 –&gt; 00:57:29,280<br>But before we do that, we’re going to do that example in the context of reversing a list.</p>
<p>1017<br>00:57:29,280 –&gt; 00:57:33,599<br>But before we look at a list that has all these different sub lists within it, let’s look</p>
<p>1018<br>00:57:33,599 –&gt; 00:57:36,720<br>at a list that has just integers.</p>
<p>1019<br>00:57:36,719 –&gt; 00:57:43,079<br>How would we think about this problem recursively to reverse all the elements in this list?</p>
<p>1020<br>00:57:43,079 –&gt; 00:57:44,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1021<br>00:57:44,279 –&gt; 00:57:48,959<br>So again, we’re going to use the very same pattern we’ve been using all throughout today when</p>
<p>1022<br>00:57:48,959 –&gt; 00:57:50,679<br>we’ve been dealing with lists.</p>
<p>1023<br>00:57:50,679 –&gt; 00:57:55,480<br>We’re going to take out the first element, extract it, and we’re going to deal with the</p>
<p>1024<br>00:57:55,480 –&gt; 00:58:00,959<br>remainder of the list, basically by running the same function we’re writing on the remainder</p>
<p>1025<br>00:58:00,959 –&gt; 00:58:02,759<br>of the list.</p>
<p>1026<br>00:58:02,760 –&gt; 00:58:07,160<br>So let’s say I have my original list and I look at my first element, just like before,</p>
<p>1027<br>00:58:07,160 –&gt; 00:58:09,240<br>I’m going to extract it out.</p>
<p>1028<br>00:58:09,240 –&gt; 00:58:17,400<br>If I take this first element and I pop it at the end and then I consider the remainder</p>
<p>1029<br>00:58:17,400 –&gt; 00:58:22,920<br>list, right, everything except for that first element that I put at the end, I can just call</p>
<p>1030<br>00:58:22,920 –&gt; 00:58:27,440<br>the same function I’m writing right now to reverse the remaining list.</p>
<p>1031<br>00:58:28,440 –&gt; 00:58:29,440<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1032<br>00:58:29,440 –&gt; 00:58:33,920<br>Which means that I’m going to take this remaining list, grab the first element, pop it at the</p>
<p>1033<br>00:58:33,920 –&gt; 00:58:38,519<br>end, and deal with the remaining list.</p>
<p>1034<br>00:58:38,519 –&gt; 00:58:42,679<br>Again, take the first element, pop it at the end, deal with the remaining list, until I have</p>
<p>1035<br>00:58:42,679 –&gt; 00:58:45,240<br>a list with length 1.</p>
<p>1036<br>00:58:45,240 –&gt; 00:58:49,559<br>How do I ever reverse a list that only has one element in it?</p>
<p>1037<br>00:58:49,559 –&gt; 00:58:51,079<br>It’s just that list, right?</p>
<p>1038<br>00:58:51,079 –&gt; 00:58:55,360<br>I just, you know, reversing a list L is just L.</p>
<p>1039<br>00:58:56,360 –&gt; 00:58:57,360<br>Right?</p>
<p>1040<br>00:58:57,360 –&gt; 00:58:58,360<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1041<br>00:58:58,360 –&gt; 00:58:59,360<br>Good.</p>
<p>1042<br>00:58:59,360 –&gt; 00:59:01,360<br>So that’s the idea.</p>
<p>1043<br>00:59:01,360 –&gt; 00:59:08,559<br>And notice that when we’re building back up the result, we took that first element and</p>
<p>1044<br>00:59:08,559 –&gt; 00:59:10,519<br>we tacked it onto the end.</p>
<p>1045<br>00:59:10,519 –&gt; 00:59:15,320<br>So we’re going to do another list concatenation kind of deal, except that the thing that I’m</p>
<p>1046<br>00:59:15,320 –&gt; 00:59:19,360<br>concatenating now, the first element will be at the end, right?</p>
<p>1047<br>00:59:19,360 –&gt; 00:59:21,360<br>It’ll be the second part of my plus.</p>
<p>1048<br>00:59:21,360 –&gt; 00:59:22,360<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1049<br>00:59:22,360 –&gt; 00:59:24,039<br>So I’m just giving you a heads up.</p>
<p>1050<br>00:59:24,039 –&gt; 00:59:25,800<br>That’s what it will look like.</p>
<p>1051<br>00:59:25,800 –&gt; 00:59:26,880<br>So let’s write the code.</p>
<p>1052<br>00:59:26,880 –&gt; 00:59:29,160<br>If the length of the list is 1, right?</p>
<p>1053<br>00:59:29,160 –&gt; 00:59:35,280<br>If I’m reversing a list with one element in it, just return that list.</p>
<p>1054<br>00:59:35,280 –&gt; 00:59:36,280<br>Easy peasy, right?</p>
<p>1055<br>00:59:36,280 –&gt; 00:59:38,079<br>It’s just the list itself.</p>
<p>1056<br>00:59:38,079 –&gt; 00:59:39,079<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1057<br>00:59:39,079 –&gt; 00:59:40,720<br>L’s.</p>
<p>1058<br>00:59:40,720 –&gt; 00:59:43,280<br>And this is where the fun comes in, right?</p>
<p>1059<br>00:59:43,280 –&gt; 00:59:51,599<br>I’ve got something, so I’m going to do something concatenated with something else.</p>
<p>1060<br>00:59:51,599 –&gt; 00:59:54,119<br>So I’m extracting the first element.</p>
<p>1061<br>00:59:54,119 –&gt; 00:59:58,059<br>There it is, L at index zero, but it’s sitting somewhere funny that we haven’t seen it sit</p>
<p>1062<br>00:59:58,059 –&gt; 00:59:59,559<br>before.</p>
<p>1063<br>00:59:59,559 –&gt; 01:00:03,000<br>It’s sitting on the second, to the right of the concatenation.</p>
<p>1064<br>01:00:03,000 –&gt; 01:00:06,639<br>And that’s fine because what we want to do is take the element from the first, the beginning</p>
<p>1065<br>01:00:06,639 –&gt; 01:00:10,480<br>of the list, and tack it onto the end, right?</p>
<p>1066<br>01:00:10,480 –&gt; 01:00:12,799<br>And there’s something else that’s funny about it.</p>
<p>1067<br>01:00:12,799 –&gt; 01:00:15,239<br>I’ve put it in square brackets.</p>
<p>1068<br>01:00:15,239 –&gt; 01:00:17,239<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1069<br>01:00:17,239 –&gt; 01:00:21,039<br>Now I, again, I’m including this example to help us think about it.</p>
<p>1070<br>01:00:21,039 –&gt; 01:00:24,119<br>Why are those square brackets there?</p>
<p>1071<br>01:00:24,119 –&gt; 01:00:27,320<br>Think about what we want this function to return.</p>
<p>1072<br>01:00:27,320 –&gt; 01:00:29,360<br>Is it returning a number?</p>
<p>1073<br>01:00:29,360 –&gt; 01:00:31,159<br>No, is there a training of Boolean?</p>
<p>1074<br>01:00:31,159 –&gt; 01:00:34,400<br>No, it’s returning a list, right?</p>
<p>1075<br>01:00:34,400 –&gt; 01:00:40,079<br>This function I want to take in a list and give me back a list, but where my elements</p>
<p>1076<br>01:00:40,079 –&gt; 01:00:42,159<br>are in reverse order.</p>
<p>1077<br>01:00:42,159 –&gt; 01:00:47,079<br>So what I want to do, right, you can already see this return over here is returning a list,</p>
<p>1078<br>01:00:47,079 –&gt; 01:00:48,079<br>right?</p>
<p>1079<br>01:00:48,079 –&gt; 01:00:51,400<br>So I want to take a list of square brackets, 10, or whatever.</p>
<p>1080<br>01:00:51,400 –&gt; 01:01:00,480<br>In my recursive step, if I’m concatenating, I want to concatenate this thing here, which</p>
<p>1081<br>01:01:00,480 –&gt; 01:01:02,719<br>I’ll tell you about in the next slide.</p>
<p>1082<br>01:01:02,719 –&gt; 01:01:04,239<br>But I’m going to concatenate it with.</p>
<p>1083<br>01:01:04,239 –&gt; 01:01:06,519<br>It’s going to be a list with some other list, right?</p>
<p>1084<br>01:01:06,519 –&gt; 01:01:12,719<br>If I concatenate a list with a number, that L at zero is, L at zero is a 10, right?</p>
<p>1085<br>01:01:12,719 –&gt; 01:01:16,599<br>So if I concatenate a list with a number, Python will yell at me.</p>
<p>1086<br>01:01:16,599 –&gt; 01:01:17,599<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1087<br>01:01:17,599 –&gt; 01:01:23,279<br>So what I need to do is make that number that I just extracted L at zero be a list.</p>
<p>1088<br>01:01:23,279 –&gt; 01:01:27,559<br>So I’m just going to slap a square bracket around it and say, hey, Python, this is a list</p>
<p>1089<br>01:01:27,559 –&gt; 01:01:30,679<br>with one element in it.</p>
<p>1090<br>01:01:30,679 –&gt; 01:01:32,159<br>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>1091<br>01:01:32,159 –&gt; 01:01:33,159<br>Cool.</p>
<p>1092<br>01:01:33,159 –&gt; 01:01:37,000<br>So then what that means is I’ve got this 10 that I extracted.</p>
<p>1093<br>01:01:37,000 –&gt; 01:01:39,199<br>I’m going to concatenate something with that 10.</p>
<p>1094<br>01:01:39,199 –&gt; 01:01:44,440<br>And that something is me putting my trust into the function I’m writing to say that something</p>
<p>1095<br>01:01:44,440 –&gt; 01:01:49,119<br>is going to be the 20, 30, 40 successfully reversed, right?</p>
<p>1096<br>01:01:49,119 –&gt; 01:01:50,760<br>40, 30, 20.</p>
<p>1097<br>01:01:50,760 –&gt; 01:01:55,519<br>If I can do that, 40, 30, 20, and I concatenate it with a 10, my job is done.</p>
<p>1098<br>01:01:55,519 –&gt; 01:01:59,720<br>I’ve successfully reversed 10, 20, 30, 40 to be 40, 30, 20, 10.</p>
<p>1099<br>01:01:59,720 –&gt; 01:02:00,720<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1100<br>01:02:00,720 –&gt; 01:02:04,200<br>And so let’s just do that.</p>
<p>1101<br>01:02:04,200 –&gt; 01:02:07,119<br>That’s me putting my trust in this function I’m writing.</p>
<p>1102<br>01:02:07,119 –&gt; 01:02:11,400<br>I’m calling the same function again saying, hey, I would like to reverse the remainder of</p>
<p>1103<br>01:02:11,400 –&gt; 01:02:13,639<br>the list.</p>
<p>1104<br>01:02:13,639 –&gt; 01:02:16,559<br>Maybe as we have been in the past, right?</p>
<p>1105<br>01:02:16,559 –&gt; 01:02:21,239<br>Super weird to think about still because we’re trusting something that we’re writing.</p>
<p>1106<br>01:02:21,239 –&gt; 01:02:22,239<br>Cool.</p>
<p>1107<br>01:02:22,239 –&gt; 01:02:24,119<br>So then let’s test it out.</p>
<p>1108<br>01:02:24,119 –&gt; 01:02:25,119<br>Let’s run it.</p>
<p>1109<br>01:02:25,119 –&gt; 01:02:32,119<br>So if I run it with list 12 ABC, Python will reverse my list, right?</p>
<p>1110<br>01:02:32,119 –&gt; 01:02:37,119<br>So it will print ABC then the two then the one.</p>
<p>1111<br>01:02:37,119 –&gt; 01:02:40,319<br>Let’s say I run it now with something slightly different.</p>
<p>1112<br>01:02:40,319 –&gt; 01:02:42,839<br>So I run it with this list here.</p>
<p>1113<br>01:02:42,840 –&gt; 01:02:45,720<br>How many elements does this list have?</p>
<p>1114<br>01:02:45,720 –&gt; 01:02:47,600<br>Test.</p>
<p>1115<br>01:02:47,600 –&gt; 01:02:49,600<br>You guys tell me.</p>
<p>1116<br>01:02:49,600 –&gt; 01:02:50,600<br>Three, exactly.</p>
<p>1117<br>01:02:50,600 –&gt; 01:02:54,600<br>The first one is an integer, the second one is a list, and the last one is a list that’s</p>
<p>1118<br>01:02:54,600 –&gt; 01:02:56,440<br>got a bunch of garbage in it.</p>
<p>1119<br>01:02:56,440 –&gt; 01:03:01,680<br>But as test, I don’t care because I just care that I have three elements inside.</p>
<p>1120<br>01:03:01,680 –&gt; 01:03:07,680<br>And so when I run this function on test, it will reverse just the top level because that’s</p>
<p>1121<br>01:03:07,680 –&gt; 01:03:08,680<br>what this is doing, right?</p>
<p>1122<br>01:03:08,679 –&gt; 01:03:13,919<br>Nowhere in here, did I say I want to reverse lists within lists, right?</p>
<p>1123<br>01:03:13,919 –&gt; 01:03:19,639<br>I didn’t say if you’re a list also reverse yourself, I just said top level, take this element,</p>
<p>1124<br>01:03:19,639 –&gt; 01:03:20,719<br>put it at the end.</p>
<p>1125<br>01:03:20,719 –&gt; 01:03:26,440<br>So when I reverse test, this funky looking test over here, it will take that first element,</p>
<p>1126<br>01:03:26,440 –&gt; 01:03:30,239<br>put it at the end, the middle element stays where it is.</p>
<p>1127<br>01:03:30,239 –&gt; 01:03:34,719<br>And the last element comes first.</p>
<p>1128<br>01:03:34,719 –&gt; 01:03:36,199<br>As everyone okay so far.</p>
<p>1129<br>01:03:36,199 –&gt; 01:03:38,239<br>I’m worried there aren’t many more questions.</p>
<p>1130<br>01:03:38,239 –&gt; 01:03:42,719<br>So okay.</p>
<p>1131<br>01:03:42,719 –&gt; 01:03:46,919<br>All right, so that’s good.</p>
<p>1132<br>01:03:46,919 –&gt; 01:03:52,359<br>But this is now not really what I’d like, right?</p>
<p>1133<br>01:03:52,359 –&gt; 01:03:58,799<br>What I’d like is if I have lists within lists within lists within lists, and those lists</p>
<p>1134<br>01:03:58,799 –&gt; 01:04:01,399<br>have some sort of elements within them, right?</p>
<p>1135<br>01:04:01,399 –&gt; 01:04:06,000<br>At the lowest level, I’ve got a list that’s going to have some integer string or whatever</p>
<p>1136<br>01:04:06,000 –&gt; 01:04:07,000<br>in it.</p>
<p>1137<br>01:04:07,000 –&gt; 01:04:11,599<br>What I would like to do is to reverse those elements as well.</p>
<p>1138<br>01:04:11,599 –&gt; 01:04:19,119<br>So really what I would have liked to have if I passed in this list here is to say, well,</p>
<p>1139<br>01:04:19,119 –&gt; 01:04:21,719<br>why don’t you reverse everything?</p>
<p>1140<br>01:04:21,719 –&gt; 01:04:30,039<br>So I would like to have had gf as a list and then the e and then the d and then the one.</p>
<p>1141<br>01:04:30,039 –&gt; 01:04:35,199<br>And so this is where we’re going to do that.</p>
<p>1142<br>01:04:35,199 –&gt; 01:04:37,239<br>So let’s say I now have a list.</p>
<p>1143<br>01:04:37,239 –&gt; 01:04:43,359<br>So each one of these blue squares is my list or my list elements and my top level.</p>
<p>1144<br>01:04:43,359 –&gt; 01:04:48,199<br>And they happen to have some sort of lists within them.</p>
<p>1145<br>01:04:48,199 –&gt; 01:04:49,559<br>How do I do this?</p>
<p>1146<br>01:04:49,559 –&gt; 01:04:56,559<br>Well now that I have potential list elements, I need to have my recursive function test</p>
<p>1147<br>01:04:56,559 –&gt; 01:05:01,559<br>where the element I’m currently considering is a list or not.</p>
<p>1148<br>01:05:01,559 –&gt; 01:05:06,159<br>If it’s not like the three and the four, I can treat them in the exact same way that</p>
<p>1149<br>01:05:06,159 –&gt; 01:05:09,440<br>we treated them in this case.</p>
<p>1150<br>01:05:09,440 –&gt; 01:05:15,400<br>But if it is a list as this one is, right, this is a list element and this is also a list</p>
<p>1151<br>01:05:15,400 –&gt; 01:05:17,519<br>element that has lists elements within it.</p>
<p>1152<br>01:05:17,519 –&gt; 01:05:19,159<br>So that’s even funcier.</p>
<p>1153<br>01:05:19,159 –&gt; 01:05:22,039<br>Then we need to consider them separately.</p>
<p>1154<br>01:05:22,039 –&gt; 01:05:28,239<br>So let’s take the code that we wrote in the previous slide because it’s a good start, extract</p>
<p>1155<br>01:05:28,239 –&gt; 01:05:32,679<br>the first element, right, put it at the end.</p>
<p>1156<br>01:05:32,679 –&gt; 01:05:35,000<br>That’s what we did before.</p>
<p>1157<br>01:05:35,000 –&gt; 01:05:43,039<br>But before leaving, let’s say if you are a list, right, if you are a list, then also reverse</p>
<p>1158<br>01:05:43,039 –&gt; 01:05:45,959<br>yourself.</p>
<p>1159<br>01:05:45,959 –&gt; 01:05:51,279<br>So not only do I want top level, that list, you know, that element to go to the end, I also</p>
<p>1160<br>01:05:51,279 –&gt; 01:05:53,639<br>want to consider what you are, right?</p>
<p>1161<br>01:05:53,639 –&gt; 01:05:55,959<br>I don’t want this last element to be 1 comma 2.</p>
<p>1162<br>01:05:55,960 –&gt; 01:05:59,159<br>I want to reverse its elements to be 2 comma 1.</p>
<p>1163<br>01:05:59,159 –&gt; 01:06:04,960<br>So in the end, what I want this to give me is 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>
<p>1164<br>01:06:04,960 –&gt; 01:06:05,960<br>All right.</p>
<p>1165<br>01:06:05,960 –&gt; 01:06:10,639<br>So that deals with that first element being popped at the end there.</p>
<p>1166<br>01:06:10,639 –&gt; 01:06:12,240<br>Now I consider my new list.</p>
<p>1167<br>01:06:12,240 –&gt; 01:06:15,559<br>Again, this is going to be a recursive step.</p>
<p>1168<br>01:06:15,559 –&gt; 01:06:18,440<br>The element at the front, again, I extract it.</p>
<p>1169<br>01:06:18,440 –&gt; 01:06:19,760<br>It’s just a number, right?</p>
<p>1170<br>01:06:19,760 –&gt; 01:06:21,000<br>Nothing special here.</p>
<p>1171<br>01:06:21,000 –&gt; 01:06:23,880<br>So you just go to the end, right?</p>
<p>1172<br>01:06:23,880 –&gt; 01:06:25,039<br>Just like before.</p>
<p>1173<br>01:06:25,039 –&gt; 01:06:28,159<br>I’m going to consider nothing to reverse for that 3.</p>
<p>1174<br>01:06:28,159 –&gt; 01:06:32,840<br>Again, the 4, just like before, it goes to the end.</p>
<p>1175<br>01:06:32,840 –&gt; 01:06:37,440<br>And now, what about this list with lists within it and so on?</p>
<p>1176<br>01:06:37,440 –&gt; 01:06:41,079<br>Well, we’ve reached sort of this Quarancourt base case.</p>
<p>1177<br>01:06:41,079 –&gt; 01:06:45,759<br>So there’s nothing to put at the end, but you can imagine being put at the end if it was,</p>
<p>1178<br>01:06:45,759 –&gt; 01:06:48,119<br>if there were other elements within it.</p>
<p>1179<br>01:06:48,119 –&gt; 01:06:50,639<br>So this one is going to stay as is, sorry about that.</p>
<p>1180<br>01:06:50,639 –&gt; 01:06:52,559<br>This one is going to stay as is.</p>
<p>1181<br>01:06:52,559 –&gt; 01:06:55,639<br>So what we’re going to do is going to say, well, you are a list.</p>
<p>1182<br>01:06:55,639 –&gt; 01:06:57,199<br>Just like this one was a list, right?</p>
<p>1183<br>01:06:57,199 –&gt; 01:06:59,480<br>It was a list with two numbers in it.</p>
<p>1184<br>01:06:59,480 –&gt; 01:07:02,920<br>So you are also a list with two elements in it.</p>
<p>1185<br>01:07:02,920 –&gt; 01:07:06,639<br>So the first step I would like you to do is reverse yourself.</p>
<p>1186<br>01:07:06,639 –&gt; 01:07:10,960<br>So the 7, 8 will come to the front and the 5, 6 will go after it.</p>
<p>1187<br>01:07:13,960 –&gt; 01:07:19,199<br>But it’s elements also our lists.</p>
<p>1188<br>01:07:19,199 –&gt; 01:07:26,000<br>So not only do I want to reverse you, but I want you to tell all your elements to reverse themselves.</p>
<p>1189<br>01:07:26,000 –&gt; 01:07:35,239<br>So the 5, 6 should reverse to be a comma 6, 5, and the 7, 8 should reverse itself to become a 8, 7.</p>
<p>1190<br>01:07:38,519 –&gt; 01:07:40,519<br>Okay, does that make sense?</p>
<p>1191<br>01:07:40,519 –&gt; 01:07:42,679<br>Conceptually, I think we got it.</p>
<p>1192<br>01:07:42,679 –&gt; 01:07:43,719<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1193<br>01:07:43,719 –&gt; 01:07:49,199<br>So we want to reverse as far deep as we can until we get to some numbers.</p>
<p>1194<br>01:07:49,199 –&gt; 01:07:50,199<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1195<br>01:07:50,199 –&gt; 01:07:55,079<br>Okay. So let’s write the code.</p>
<p>1196<br>01:07:55,079 –&gt; 01:07:59,679<br>Okay. We’re going to do a very similar thing to what we’ve done in the past, right?</p>
<p>1197<br>01:07:59,679 –&gt; 01:08:03,639<br>All of these examples following the exact same pattern.</p>
<p>1198<br>01:08:03,639 –&gt; 01:08:08,919<br>Consider a list with one element in it, and then consider a list with many elements in it.</p>
<p>1199<br>01:08:08,920 –&gt; 01:08:18,199<br>If I have a list with one element in it, so here, here’s a list, right?</p>
<p>1200<br>01:08:18,199 –&gt; 01:08:21,640<br>It’s going to have only one element in it.</p>
<p>1201<br>01:08:21,640 –&gt; 01:08:30,359<br>If the list is a, if that element within that list is a number, I’m going to do something</p>
<p>1202<br>01:08:30,359 –&gt; 01:08:36,880<br>different than if the element within this list is a list, right?</p>
<p>1203<br>01:08:36,880 –&gt; 01:08:43,359<br>So what I actually want to do inside this, if LnL is equal to 1, is have two subparts,</p>
<p>1204<br>01:08:43,359 –&gt; 01:08:44,359<br>right?</p>
<p>1205<br>01:08:44,359 –&gt; 01:08:46,199<br>Depending on whether it’s a list or not.</p>
<p>1206<br>01:08:46,199 –&gt; 01:08:51,600<br>Because if it’s just a number, I’m happy to just leave it as is, right?</p>
<p>1207<br>01:08:51,600 –&gt; 01:08:54,680<br>Like this number is already in place, right?</p>
<p>1208<br>01:08:54,680 –&gt; 01:08:56,880<br>It’s already reversed.</p>
<p>1209<br>01:08:56,880 –&gt; 01:09:04,880<br>But if the element within it is a list, right?</p>
<p>1210<br>01:09:04,880 –&gt; 01:09:12,640<br>This element is one element inside my list, is also a list, I want it to reverse itself.</p>
<p>1211<br>01:09:12,640 –&gt; 01:09:17,680<br>So if the length of the list is one, I now check the type.</p>
<p>1212<br>01:09:17,680 –&gt; 01:09:21,560<br>If it’s not a list, I do exactly the same thing as I did before.</p>
<p>1213<br>01:09:21,560 –&gt; 01:09:24,400<br>If it’s not a list, you are already reversed.</p>
<p>1214<br>01:09:24,400 –&gt; 01:09:25,800<br>No need to reverse anything else.</p>
<p>1215<br>01:09:25,800 –&gt; 01:09:26,800<br>Yes, question?</p>
<p>1216<br>01:09:26,800 –&gt; 01:09:33,119<br>I guess the element can be spelled by one element.</p>
<p>1217<br>01:09:33,119 –&gt; 01:09:37,560<br>Yeah, so we’re just dividing it into one element or two, or more than one.</p>
<p>1218<br>01:09:37,560 –&gt; 01:09:44,680<br>So in the case where we have one element, right, this is my list, and this is the one element.</p>
<p>1219<br>01:09:44,680 –&gt; 01:09:50,600<br>And if I have an element that’s a list itself, then this is still one element.</p>
<p>1220<br>01:09:50,600 –&gt; 01:09:51,600<br>Yep.</p>
<p>1221<br>01:09:51,600 –&gt; 01:09:57,600<br>Let’s say you raise the brackets on the outside of the…</p>
<p>1222<br>01:09:57,600 –&gt; 01:09:58,600<br>Yep.</p>
<p>1223<br>01:09:58,600 –&gt; 01:10:02,600<br>This is now a list with two elements in it.</p>
<p>1224<br>01:10:02,600 –&gt; 01:10:05,520<br>Yep, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>1225<br>01:10:05,520 –&gt; 01:10:09,840<br>But I am considering the case where I have a list with one element, it happens to be another</p>
<p>1226<br>01:10:09,840 –&gt; 01:10:10,840<br>list.</p>
<p>1227<br>01:10:10,840 –&gt; 01:10:14,360<br>And what’s inside it, I don’t currently care, because yeah.</p>
<p>1228<br>01:10:14,359 –&gt; 01:10:18,239<br>So if it’s not a list, it’s already reversed.</p>
<p>1229<br>01:10:18,239 –&gt; 01:10:22,039<br>Otherwise, what do we do?</p>
<p>1230<br>01:10:22,039 –&gt; 01:10:27,439<br>Well we want to ask it to reverse itself, and that’s the function we’re currently writing.</p>
<p>1231<br>01:10:27,439 –&gt; 01:10:28,439<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1232<br>01:10:28,439 –&gt; 01:10:32,439<br>Is that cool?</p>
<p>1233<br>01:10:32,439 –&gt; 01:10:33,439<br>I guess.</p>
<p>1234<br>01:10:33,439 –&gt; 01:10:34,439<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1235<br>01:10:34,439 –&gt; 01:10:38,079<br>Again, a lot of trust going on here, you guys.</p>
<p>1236<br>01:10:38,079 –&gt; 01:10:46,479<br>So we’re calling deep reverse this function we are currently writing on this list element,</p>
<p>1237<br>01:10:46,479 –&gt; 01:10:47,559<br>L at index zero, right?</p>
<p>1238<br>01:10:47,559 –&gt; 01:10:50,079<br>It’s our only element.</p>
<p>1239<br>01:10:50,079 –&gt; 01:10:53,319<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1240<br>01:10:53,319 –&gt; 01:11:05,519<br>And notice, again, I’ve got these square brackets around here, because this function is</p>
<p>1241<br>01:11:05,520 –&gt; 01:11:09,520<br>supposed to return a list, right?</p>
<p>1242<br>01:11:09,520 –&gt; 01:11:15,120<br>So just like in the previous case where I slapped on some square brackets around the number,</p>
<p>1243<br>01:11:15,120 –&gt; 01:11:18,000<br>I have to do it here as well.</p>
<p>1244<br>01:11:18,000 –&gt; 01:11:19,000<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1245<br>01:11:19,000 –&gt; 01:11:20,960<br>Everyone okay with this case?</p>
<p>1246<br>01:11:20,960 –&gt; 01:11:23,600<br>Because the recursive step is going to be even crazier.</p>
<p>1247<br>01:11:23,600 –&gt; 01:11:24,600<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1248<br>01:11:24,600 –&gt; 01:11:28,600<br>Else, we have a list with more than one element in it.</p>
<p>1249<br>01:11:28,600 –&gt; 01:11:29,600<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1250<br>01:11:29,600 –&gt; 01:11:35,480<br>So we have a list with some stuff here, and then I have potentially another list.</p>
<p>1251<br>01:11:35,479 –&gt; 01:11:39,559<br>And a bunch of other stuff here.</p>
<p>1252<br>01:11:39,559 –&gt; 01:11:49,279<br>So then what I would like to do is, again, according to our pattern that we’ve been looking</p>
<p>1253<br>01:11:49,279 –&gt; 01:11:54,079<br>at, is to say, I’m going to extract the first element in the list, right?</p>
<p>1254<br>01:11:54,079 –&gt; 01:11:59,839<br>So if I have a list with many elements, let’s extract the first one and deal with it.</p>
<p>1255<br>01:11:59,840 –&gt; 01:12:04,720<br>But again, I need to take care because that first element may be a number, or a string</p>
<p>1256<br>01:12:04,720 –&gt; 01:12:08,520<br>or whatever, or it may be a list.</p>
<p>1257<br>01:12:08,520 –&gt; 01:12:10,760<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1258<br>01:12:10,760 –&gt; 01:12:13,680<br>And I deal with these two cases separately.</p>
<p>1259<br>01:12:13,680 –&gt; 01:12:18,000<br>If it’s just a number, so that’s this if case here, so if the type of L at zero, the</p>
<p>1260<br>01:12:18,000 –&gt; 01:12:23,680<br>thing that I’ve extracted as a list, then what I need to do is what I had in the previous</p>
<p>1261<br>01:12:23,680 –&gt; 01:12:24,680<br>example.</p>
<p>1262<br>01:12:24,760 –&gt; 01:12:29,880<br>I grab that first element, slap square brackets around it, and concatenate it with deeper</p>
<p>1263<br>01:12:29,880 –&gt; 01:12:32,760<br>verse of the rest of it.</p>
<p>1264<br>01:12:32,760 –&gt; 01:12:34,280<br>Exactly the same as the previous case, right?</p>
<p>1265<br>01:12:34,280 –&gt; 01:12:35,360<br>Because it’s just a number.</p>
<p>1266<br>01:12:35,360 –&gt; 01:12:36,360<br>I do what I did before.</p>
<p>1267<br>01:12:36,360 –&gt; 01:12:39,320<br>Plop it to the end and we’re done.</p>
<p>1268<br>01:12:39,320 –&gt; 01:12:44,159<br>And again, I’m making a function call here to myself.</p>
<p>1269<br>01:12:44,159 –&gt; 01:12:46,000<br>Else, okay.</p>
<p>1270<br>01:12:46,000 –&gt; 01:12:53,119<br>This thing here, this L at x zero that I’ve extracted, is a list, right?</p>
<p>1271<br>01:12:53,119 –&gt; 01:13:01,099<br>So not only do I have to call deeper verse on these guys here, but everybody together,</p>
<p>1272<br>01:13:01,099 –&gt; 01:13:06,000<br>we have to call deeper verse on the first element as well, right?</p>
<p>1273<br>01:13:06,000 –&gt; 01:13:07,000<br>Because it’s a list.</p>
<p>1274<br>01:13:07,000 –&gt; 01:13:08,159<br>I can’t just put it to the end.</p>
<p>1275<br>01:13:08,159 –&gt; 01:13:11,640<br>I want to reverse it to reverse all of its elements.</p>
<p>1276<br>01:13:11,640 –&gt; 01:13:12,640<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1277<br>01:13:12,640 –&gt; 01:13:17,359<br>So this is the code to do that, right?</p>
<p>1278<br>01:13:17,359 –&gt; 01:13:26,399<br>This bit here, deeper verse L1 colon, tells the remainder of the list to reverse itself.</p>
<p>1279<br>01:13:26,399 –&gt; 01:13:28,399<br>Exactly like we did in the integer case.</p>
<p>1280<br>01:13:28,399 –&gt; 01:13:29,960<br>That was the same.</p>
<p>1281<br>01:13:29,960 –&gt; 01:13:36,039<br>But we concatenate that again by putting square brackets around it, because we want to concatenate</p>
<p>1282<br>01:13:36,039 –&gt; 01:13:41,119<br>with a list, we concatenate that with deeper verseing our element at index zero, right?</p>
<p>1283<br>01:13:41,119 –&gt; 01:13:45,759<br>So not only do we put this at the end to reverse it, but we need to it to reverse all of its</p>
<p>1284<br>01:13:45,759 –&gt; 01:13:46,759<br>elements as well.</p>
<p>1285<br>01:13:46,760 –&gt; 01:13:47,760<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1286<br>01:13:47,760 –&gt; 01:13:55,760<br>There are no more lines to this code, but what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>1287<br>01:13:55,760 –&gt; 01:13:56,760<br>I know.</p>
<p>1288<br>01:13:56,760 –&gt; 01:13:57,760<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1289<br>01:13:57,760 –&gt; 01:14:06,560<br>So, yeah, so we put square brackets because we want to maintain the same structure of</p>
<p>1290<br>01:14:06,560 –&gt; 01:14:08,560<br>what the original list was.</p>
<p>1291<br>01:14:08,560 –&gt; 01:14:13,199<br>So if it’s an integer, I guess the simplest case to explain it.</p>
<p>1292<br>01:14:13,199 –&gt; 01:14:16,920<br>So if it’s an integer, you can’t concatenate the list with the integer, right?</p>
<p>1293<br>01:14:16,920 –&gt; 01:14:17,920<br>It’ll be a problem.</p>
<p>1294<br>01:14:17,920 –&gt; 01:14:26,319<br>So you want to concatenate the list with the integer inside a list as the single element.</p>
<p>1295<br>01:14:26,319 –&gt; 01:14:28,519<br>So what we can do is we can simplify the code.</p>
<p>1296<br>01:14:28,519 –&gt; 01:14:33,000<br>Again, I personally think of this as a little bit easier to think about just kind of as I’m</p>
<p>1297<br>01:14:33,000 –&gt; 01:14:39,920<br>extracting out the case where I have one list with one thing and the list with many things.</p>
<p>1298<br>01:14:39,920 –&gt; 01:14:43,480<br>But you can certainly think of it like this.</p>
<p>1299<br>01:14:43,480 –&gt; 01:14:46,440<br>So if I have an empty list, just return an empty list.</p>
<p>1300<br>01:14:46,440 –&gt; 01:14:52,720<br>Else, I’m extracting the element and index zero directly and I deeperverse that the rest</p>
<p>1301<br>01:14:52,720 –&gt; 01:14:55,239<br>of the list concatenated with that element at the end.</p>
<p>1302<br>01:14:55,239 –&gt; 01:15:00,480<br>Again, it’s noting that we are putting this element as a list.</p>
<p>1303<br>01:15:00,480 –&gt; 01:15:07,079<br>And else, we can deeperverse the rest of the list concatenated with deeperversing this</p>
<p>1304<br>01:15:07,079 –&gt; 01:15:08,079<br>guy here, right?</p>
<p>1305<br>01:15:08,079 –&gt; 01:15:12,119<br>Only do we put it at the end, but we also reverse all of its elements.</p>
<p>1306<br>01:15:12,119 –&gt; 01:15:16,680<br>This is the simplified version, the simplified code.</p>
<p>1307<br>01:15:16,680 –&gt; 01:15:17,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1308<br>01:15:17,680 –&gt; 01:15:24,519<br>So this recursion that we saw, all these examples here that we applied to lists can actually</p>
<p>1309<br>01:15:24,519 –&gt; 01:15:28,399<br>be applied to any indexable ordered sequences, right?</p>
<p>1310<br>01:15:28,399 –&gt; 01:15:30,279<br>The same code will work for tuples.</p>
<p>1311<br>01:15:30,279 –&gt; 01:15:35,760<br>The same code will work for strings, except for the one where, because you can’t have strings</p>
<p>1312<br>01:15:35,760 –&gt; 01:15:37,479<br>within strings within strings.</p>
<p>1313<br>01:15:37,479 –&gt; 01:15:41,039<br>Certainly, you know, summing the elements in a list and checking whether an element is</p>
<p>1314<br>01:15:41,039 –&gt; 01:15:43,879<br>in a list will work for tuples as well.</p>
<p>1315<br>01:15:43,879 –&gt; 01:15:47,000<br>And, you know, some of these will work for strings as long as you can do that operation</p>
<p>1316<br>01:15:47,000 –&gt; 01:15:48,479<br>on the strings, right?</p>
<p>1317<br>01:15:48,479 –&gt; 01:15:50,519<br>Because these are all indexable sequences, right?</p>
<p>1318<br>01:15:50,519 –&gt; 01:15:54,599<br>So it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>1319<br>01:15:54,599 –&gt; 01:15:59,279<br>So lots of takeaways here with recursion.</p>
<p>1320<br>01:15:59,279 –&gt; 01:16:03,759<br>This last example, namely, is it looks really nice in the cleaned up form.</p>
<p>1321<br>01:16:03,760 –&gt; 01:16:07,560<br>And it’s, you know, like five lines of code to solve this really kind of hard problem</p>
<p>1322<br>01:16:07,560 –&gt; 01:16:12,480<br>that you would otherwise have to solve using Y loops and four loops and things like that.</p>
<p>1323<br>01:16:12,480 –&gt; 01:16:16,520<br>So I definitely encourage you to take a look through the Python tutor links that I’ve</p>
<p>1324<br>01:16:16,520 –&gt; 01:16:17,520<br>put in.</p>
<p>1325<br>01:16:17,520 –&gt; 01:16:23,800<br>My two tips, so the two big takeaways on recursion is this thing about case, cases, right?</p>
<p>1326<br>01:16:23,800 –&gt; 01:16:28,239<br>Anytime you have a return statement and you’re writing a recursive function, make sure that</p>
<p>1327<br>01:16:28,239 –&gt; 01:16:32,280<br>every single return statement is returning something that is of that same type.</p>
<p>1328<br>01:16:32,279 –&gt; 01:16:35,719<br>Otherwise, you’ll have type mismatches all over the place, okay?</p>
<p>1329<br>01:16:35,719 –&gt; 01:16:40,840<br>And then the recursive step takes advantage of the fact that you are returning these kinds</p>
<p>1330<br>01:16:40,840 –&gt; 01:16:41,840<br>of types, right?</p>
<p>1331<br>01:16:41,840 –&gt; 01:16:45,920<br>So then those operations and the recursive step will work with those types.</p>
<p>1332<br>01:16:45,920 –&gt; 01:16:50,479<br>And the second is the function doesn’t have to be efficient on the first pass, right?</p>
<p>1333<br>01:16:50,479 –&gt; 01:16:54,319<br>So the way we thought about the problem by separating it and list with one element and</p>
<p>1334<br>01:16:54,319 –&gt; 01:17:00,519<br>many is easier for me to think about because I can wrap my head around the problem.</p>
<p>1335<br>01:17:00,520 –&gt; 01:17:04,160<br>And you don’t have to write the most efficient code write off the bat for recursion.</p>
<p>1336<br>01:17:04,160 –&gt; 01:17:05,360<br>Certainly, no need to do that.</p>
<p>1337<br>01:17:05,360 –&gt; 01:17:09,120<br>But you can definitely clean it up after you have something that works.</p>
<p>1338<br>01:17:09,120 –&gt; 01:17:13,440<br>Many practice problems on the Python file for today.</p>
<p>1339<br>01:17:13,440 –&gt; 01:17:15,240<br>Many, many practice problems.</p>
<p>1340<br>01:17:15,240 –&gt; 01:17:18,360<br>Memoizing the basketball, obviously, I mentioned that.</p>
<p>1341<br>01:17:18,360 –&gt; 01:17:22,360<br>An example, a little practice with no lists within lists.</p>
<p>1342<br>01:17:22,360 –&gt; 01:17:26,360<br>An example or a practice with lists within lists within lists.</p>
<p>1343<br>01:17:26,359 –&gt; 01:17:30,599<br>And then I included three buggy recursion implementations for you to try to fix.</p>
<p>1344<br>01:17:30,599 –&gt; 01:17:34,119<br>So a little bit of debugging practice plus recursion practice.</p>
<p>1345<br>01:17:34,119 –&gt; 01:17:35,119<br>All right.</p>
<p>1346<br>01:17:35,119 –&gt; 01:17:36,359<br>Thanks all.</p>
