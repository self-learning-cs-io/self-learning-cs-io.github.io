                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:18,559<br>All right, let’s get started.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:18,559 –&gt; 00:00:24,879<br>So today we’re going to be starting a completely new set of topics and we’ll be talking about</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:24,879 –&gt; 00:00:29,879<br>these topics for the next four lectures and it’s a big topic.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:29,879 –&gt; 00:00:34,780<br>The big idea we’re trying to accomplish in these next four lectures is for us to start</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:34,780 –&gt; 00:00:39,239<br>defining our own object types.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:39,239 –&gt; 00:00:46,439<br>And we’ll be defining these object types through these things called Python classes.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:46,439 –&gt; 00:00:53,439<br>So today’s lecture will just define a really simple object type and then we’ll build</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:53,439 –&gt; 00:00:55,079<br>up from there on.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:55,079 –&gt; 00:01:01,439<br>So let’s take a step back and think about particular objects, like really specific objects</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:01,439 –&gt; 00:01:03,239<br>that we’ve been working with.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:03,239 –&gt; 00:01:08,319<br>So for example, we’ve been working with probably the number 1234.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:08,319 –&gt; 00:01:11,319<br>We’ve been working with the float pi 3.141.5.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:11,319 –&gt; 00:01:12,319<br>9.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:12,319 –&gt; 00:01:17,719<br>We’ve been working with sequences of characters like HLLO with lists of numbers, right?</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:17,719 –&gt; 00:01:22,480<br>So here’s a list with those specific elements within it and we’ve been working with dictionaries.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:22,480 –&gt; 00:01:27,420<br>And here’s a specific dictionary with these entries.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:27,420 –&gt; 00:01:31,780<br>Now every one of these things up here is an object, right?</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:31,780 –&gt; 00:01:33,680<br>We have it in our program.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:33,680 –&gt; 00:01:34,760<br>We can manipulate it.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:34,760 –&gt; 00:01:36,000<br>We can add it to other things.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:36,000 –&gt; 00:01:37,000<br>We can index.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:37,000 –&gt; 00:01:38,240<br>We can do all these things.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:38,240 –&gt; 00:01:42,560<br>But every one of these objects is basically has a certain type, right?</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:42,560 –&gt; 00:01:48,400<br>We talked about this back in lecture one when I introduced types of objects.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:48,400 –&gt; 00:01:49,760<br>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:49,760 –&gt; 00:01:55,280<br>Well in that lecture I said that the type of an object basically tells us the kinds of</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:55,280 –&gt; 00:01:56,920<br>things that we can do with it, right?</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:56,920 –&gt; 00:02:00,600<br>So the things you can do with a number are going to be different than the kinds of things</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:00,600 –&gt; 00:02:01,760<br>you can do with strings.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:01,760 –&gt; 00:02:06,439<br>And we’ve been seeing this since that lecture up until today.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:06,439 –&gt; 00:02:09,360<br>Today we’re going to see how we can create our own object types.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:09,360 –&gt; 00:02:14,120<br>So to do that we have to understand the following thing and this is something I’ll keep repeating</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:14,120 –&gt; 00:02:15,120<br>today.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:15,520 –&gt; 00:02:19,759<br>So we decide to create an object type, or every one of these objects for example, has</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:19,759 –&gt; 00:02:22,879<br>been created using some blueprint, right?</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:22,879 –&gt; 00:02:25,840<br>And when you’re creating these objects you need to think about two things.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:25,840 –&gt; 00:02:28,800<br>The first is what data will represent this object?</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:28,800 –&gt; 00:02:32,280<br>And the second is what behaviors will this object have?</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:32,280 –&gt; 00:02:35,319<br>Now the objects up here are pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:35,319 –&gt; 00:02:40,640<br>The kinds of data that represents this integer is, well there’s no data really, it’s just</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:40,640 –&gt; 00:02:42,120<br>the number itself.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:42,520 –&gt; 00:02:45,960<br>It has some operations, some things that you can do with this integer.</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:45,960 –&gt; 00:02:51,640<br>Now the data that represents a list is going to be different than the data that represents</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:51,640 –&gt; 00:02:58,120<br>an integer because a list is kind of made up of a sequence of numbers or objects.</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:58,120 –&gt; 00:03:02,040<br>And then the data that makes up a dictionary is completely different than the data that</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:02,040 –&gt; 00:03:06,319<br>makes up the list because a dictionary has entries where each entry has a key and a value</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:06,319 –&gt; 00:03:09,640<br>pair and then you have a bunch of these entries, right?</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:09,639 –&gt; 00:03:13,439<br>So the data representing each one of these objects is different and we’re going to decide</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:13,439 –&gt; 00:03:17,239<br>what data represents the new objects that we want to create.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:17,239 –&gt; 00:03:21,119<br>And of course this is something we’ve known from the first lecture, the kinds of ways</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:21,119 –&gt; 00:03:24,719<br>that we can interact with these objects is also different amongst all these different</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:24,719 –&gt; 00:03:26,519<br>object types, right?</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:26,519 –&gt; 00:03:33,119<br>So in terms of terminology, when we create an actual object that we want to manipulate,</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:33,119 –&gt; 00:03:35,839<br>we call it an instance of a type.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:35,840 –&gt; 00:03:43,120<br>So this specific number, 1234, is an instance of an integer and this specific sequence of</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:43,120 –&gt; 00:03:47,920<br>characters, lowercase HLLO, is an instance of a string.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:47,920 –&gt; 00:03:54,319<br>All right, so the idea of object-oriented programming is basically that everything in Python</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:54,319 –&gt; 00:03:59,199<br>is an object and this we’ve talked about when we were introducing functions, we treated</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:59,199 –&gt; 00:04:01,520<br>functions like objects.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:01,520 –&gt; 00:04:06,880<br>And what that means is that we can create new objects that have some type, so we actually</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:06,880 –&gt; 00:04:12,120<br>create these very specific objects that we can manipulate and we can also destroy the</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:12,120 –&gt; 00:04:13,120<br>objects, right?</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:13,120 –&gt; 00:04:15,719<br>So you can create them, manipulate them, and destroy them as you will.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:15,719 –&gt; 00:04:18,879<br>But each one of these objects has a specific type.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:18,879 –&gt; 00:04:23,439<br>So let’s talk a little bit more about the data abstraction.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:23,439 –&gt; 00:04:29,040<br>So once you have an object that you’d like to create, so think of anything in the world,</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:29,040 –&gt; 00:04:35,520<br>some something, the two things that you need to think about are what is going to be the</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:35,520 –&gt; 00:04:39,800<br>way that you represent the object in terms of data, right?</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:39,800 –&gt; 00:04:43,200<br>And the other thing is what are the behaviors of this object?</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:43,200 –&gt; 00:04:49,080<br>How can other programmers or other objects interact with this thing that you’re creating?</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:49,080 –&gt; 00:04:54,080<br>So when we’re creating our own object type, we have to think about these data abstractions,</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:54,080 –&gt; 00:04:55,080<br>okay?</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:55,080 –&gt; 00:04:57,080<br>So let’s take a more sort of real life example.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:57,079 –&gt; 00:05:02,439<br>So let’s say I have these two very specific cars that actually exist in the real world.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:02,439 –&gt; 00:05:06,519<br>So we can actually drive these cars around, we can manipulate them, right?</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:06,519 –&gt; 00:05:07,919<br>They have already been created.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:07,919 –&gt; 00:05:10,680<br>They are actual objects, right?</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:10,680 –&gt; 00:05:16,079<br>Well behind the scenes, these objects were created using some blueprint, right?</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:16,079 –&gt; 00:05:19,319<br>This blueprint is not an actual tangible thing.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:19,319 –&gt; 00:05:25,759<br>It’s basically some abstract notion of how to create those specific objects, those specific</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:25,759 –&gt; 00:05:27,319<br>cars.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:27,319 –&gt; 00:05:33,439<br>So as we’re thinking about creating our own object types, we have to think about design decisions,</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:33,439 –&gt; 00:05:34,439<br>right?</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:34,439 –&gt; 00:05:38,279<br>If I want to create a blueprint for a car that somebody can then use to create an actual</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:38,279 –&gt; 00:05:42,519<br>car in real life, how do I abstract the car?</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:42,519 –&gt; 00:05:46,759<br>And as we’re creating these objects ourselves, we get to make these design decisions, which</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:46,759 –&gt; 00:05:48,039<br>is pretty cool.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:48,039 –&gt; 00:05:52,120<br>So if I were creating this car, right, the blueprint for a car, I would say, well, I’m going</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:52,120 –&gt; 00:05:56,000<br>to use maybe the length of the car, the width of the car, and the height of the car, and</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:56,000 –&gt; 00:05:57,519<br>the color of the car.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:57,519 –&gt; 00:06:02,519<br>And those four data attributes will represent a car object.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:02,519 –&gt; 00:06:04,519<br>But of course that’s my design decision, right?</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:04,519 –&gt; 00:06:08,920<br>If you are more familiar with cars or if you wanted to get into a more detailed description</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:08,920 –&gt; 00:06:15,519<br>or representation, you would also have a number for how many horsepower it has, how many</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:15,519 –&gt; 00:06:20,040<br>doors it has, maybe how many people could fit, you know, other things like that.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:20,040 –&gt; 00:06:26,000<br>But a very simple data abstraction for a car is length, width, height, and color.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:26,000 –&gt; 00:06:27,000<br>All right?</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:27,000 –&gt; 00:06:28,480<br>So that’s data abstract.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:28,480 –&gt; 00:06:31,400<br>So what data represents this object you’re trying to create?</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:31,400 –&gt; 00:06:32,720<br>Now how about the interface?</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:32,720 –&gt; 00:06:37,720<br>Well, in terms of the interface, we decide what are some ways that programmers can interact</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:37,720 –&gt; 00:06:41,560<br>with the object or other objects can interact with this object.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:41,560 –&gt; 00:06:47,759<br>So we could say that we could let the users change the color of the car, right?</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:47,759 –&gt; 00:06:54,759<br>We could say that we can let the car make a noise, so honk the horn, could be maybe one</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:54,759 –&gt; 00:06:57,759<br>thing, one function that this car could do.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:57,759 –&gt; 00:07:01,959<br>And if we say honk the horn, then maybe you would print something to the screen, right?</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:01,959 –&gt; 00:07:02,959<br>Something like that.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:02,959 –&gt; 00:07:06,800<br>And then we can have the car drive from point A to point B, or we could have the car,</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:06,800 –&gt; 00:07:11,319<br>you know, go in a circle, you could have the car crash on other car.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:11,319 –&gt; 00:07:19,719<br>And all of these behaviors will are part of this interface for this particular car.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:19,719 –&gt; 00:07:24,079<br>But we’re going to define them such that any car that we create from here on, any actual</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:24,079 –&gt; 00:07:29,399<br>object that we create, will have all of these behaviors and all of these data attributes.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:29,399 –&gt; 00:07:33,519<br>So an example a little closer to home is the list, right?</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:33,519 –&gt; 00:07:36,079<br>We’ve been working with lists so far.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:36,079 –&gt; 00:07:41,479<br>So behind the scenes, somebody created the data type list, right?</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:41,479 –&gt; 00:07:46,120<br>So there’s some code in Python that basically defines the data that makes up the list, the</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:46,120 –&gt; 00:07:53,000<br>data attributes, how is a list described, and the behaviors, the procedures, the functions</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:53,000 –&gt; 00:07:55,079<br>that a list can do, right?</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:55,079 –&gt; 00:07:59,639<br>So in terms of data attributes, well, there’s many design decisions that, you know, whoever</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:59,639 –&gt; 00:08:03,240<br>decided to create this list class could have done, how could they have represented the</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:03,240 –&gt; 00:08:04,240<br>list?</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:04,240 –&gt; 00:08:08,879<br>Well, they could have said, I’m going to allocate sort of a continuous block of memory and</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:08,879 –&gt; 00:08:12,040<br>where, and your elements will go in that order, right?</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:12,040 –&gt; 00:08:15,319<br>From the smallest memory of value to the biggest memory value.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:15,319 –&gt; 00:08:17,280<br>That’s one design decision.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:17,280 –&gt; 00:08:21,680<br>Another one could be that instead of allocating sort of a continuous block of memory, you</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:21,680 –&gt; 00:08:25,480<br>could say, I can allocate memories here and there, that’s okay.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:25,480 –&gt; 00:08:32,080<br>But then each element in my, in my list will then be represented by two things.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:32,080 –&gt; 00:08:36,800<br>The first being the value at that location, and the second could be maybe another integer</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:36,800 –&gt; 00:08:41,840<br>or something that tells Python which memory location to go to to get the next element in</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:41,840 –&gt; 00:08:43,200<br>the list.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:43,200 –&gt; 00:08:47,720<br>So both valid design decisions, I think Python did the second one.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:47,720 –&gt; 00:08:48,720<br>All right.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:48,720 –&gt; 00:08:53,200<br>So those are, that’s how you represent the data that represents the list.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:53,200 –&gt; 00:08:55,960<br>And in terms of behaviors, well, we’ve already been working with lists.</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:55,960 –&gt; 00:08:58,879<br>So we know a bunch of the behaviors that lists have, right?</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:58,879 –&gt; 00:09:02,040<br>You can index into it, you can sort of list, you can append an item to the end of the</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:02,039 –&gt; 00:09:04,959<br>list, you can get the maximum element within the list.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:04,959 –&gt; 00:09:09,799<br>All of these different procedures, functions are things that you can do with lists, right?</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:09,799 –&gt; 00:09:11,319<br>And we’ve been working with them.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:11,319 –&gt; 00:09:15,839<br>And we’ve been working with lists without actually knowing the representation, how somebody</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:15,839 –&gt; 00:09:18,279<br>decided to represent this class, okay?</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:18,279 –&gt; 00:09:20,360<br>Which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:20,360 –&gt; 00:09:22,519<br>So a couple more real life examples, right?</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:22,519 –&gt; 00:09:26,519<br>If we were to think about representing, you know, one of the, each of these.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:26,519 –&gt; 00:09:29,360<br>So if we think about the object and elevator, right?</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:29,360 –&gt; 00:09:32,440<br>Again, it’s up to us to make the design decision.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:32,440 –&gt; 00:09:34,919<br>It’s basically a box that can change floors, right?</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:34,919 –&gt; 00:09:38,200<br>So we could represent it using the length of width, the height.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:38,200 –&gt; 00:09:41,680<br>Maybe we could also represent, which are all, you know, floats or something like that.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:41,680 –&gt; 00:09:47,120<br>We can also represent it using the max capacity and the current floor it’s at.</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:47,120 –&gt; 00:09:55,320<br>So all five of these variables, you know, together, values together, represent my elevator, right?</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:55,320 –&gt; 00:09:57,440<br>And again, it’s my design decision to do this.</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:57,440 –&gt; 00:09:58,920<br>Yours might be different.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:58,919 –&gt; 00:10:04,120<br>But in terms of things that the elevator can do, well, we can change its current floor,</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:04,120 –&gt; 00:10:07,599<br>which is basically saying, you know, change the value of the variable current floor to be</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:07,599 –&gt; 00:10:09,439<br>something else.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:09,439 –&gt; 00:10:13,599<br>Add people to it, maybe checking if you’re at max capacity or not, and maybe printing</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:13,599 –&gt; 00:10:17,919<br>out a warning if you’re above that, removing people, things like that.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:17,919 –&gt; 00:10:23,799<br>An employee is also a pretty common example of something that’s typically implemented</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:23,799 –&gt; 00:10:25,719<br>in a bunch of programming languages.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:25,720 –&gt; 00:10:29,120<br>So an employee, basically a person that has a salary, right?</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:29,120 –&gt; 00:10:31,000<br>Maybe works for company X.</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:31,000 –&gt; 00:10:34,240<br>So you could represent this employee using their name, right?</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:34,240 –&gt; 00:10:37,639<br>Maybe a string for the first name, a string for the last name, and then their birthday,</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:37,639 –&gt; 00:10:43,360<br>maybe, and then their salary, which is, you know, a float or something like that.</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:43,360 –&gt; 00:10:47,000<br>And in terms of behavior is what can employees do, where you can change their name, you can</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:47,000 –&gt; 00:10:50,960<br>change their salary, you can maybe activate or deactivate them as current employees,</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:50,960 –&gt; 00:10:51,960<br>things like that.</p>
<p>170<br>00:10:52,200 –&gt; 00:10:58,000<br>A queue at a store, also a really nice example, and it kind of goes hand in hand with stack</p>
<p>171<br>00:10:58,000 –&gt; 00:11:00,040<br>of pancakes.</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:00,040 –&gt; 00:11:02,080<br>How would you represent a queue at a store?</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:02,080 –&gt; 00:11:06,440<br>Well, the representation isn’t going to be a set of things.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:06,440 –&gt; 00:11:12,720<br>The representation could be something really simple, like just a list, right?</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:12,720 –&gt; 00:11:13,720<br>Which is fine.</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:13,720 –&gt; 00:11:17,759<br>So maybe the list will have, you know, some strings with the names of the people who are currently</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:17,759 –&gt; 00:11:20,280<br>in the queue at a store.</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:20,279 –&gt; 00:11:26,839<br>But what’s going to make a queue kind of special is that is the way that we’ll be using it,</p>
<p>179<br>00:11:26,839 –&gt; 00:11:27,839<br>right?</p>
<p>180<br>00:11:27,839 –&gt; 00:11:29,519<br>So the representation isn’t super unique.</p>
<p>181<br>00:11:29,519 –&gt; 00:11:31,679<br>It’s just a list.</p>
<p>182<br>00:11:31,679 –&gt; 00:11:36,679<br>But the way that a queue operates will be special, because if you think about the queue,</p>
<p>183<br>00:11:36,679 –&gt; 00:11:40,919<br>the first person who comes into the queue will be the first person out of the queue, right?</p>
<p>184<br>00:11:40,919 –&gt; 00:11:43,759<br>The first in, first out kind of situation.</p>
<p>185<br>00:11:43,759 –&gt; 00:11:48,360<br>So that means if you make the design decision to add new people at the end of the queue, right?</p>
<p>186<br>00:11:48,360 –&gt; 00:11:54,919<br>So if I have a new person that gets added here, they’re the newest person in.</p>
<p>187<br>00:11:54,919 –&gt; 00:11:58,680<br>That means if I’m removing a person from the queue, I better remove the oldest one, which</p>
<p>188<br>00:11:58,680 –&gt; 00:12:02,800<br>is going to be over at the beginning of my list, right?</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:02,800 –&gt; 00:12:07,879<br>So the way that you use the queue will be consistent with this idea, and then, you know,</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:07,879 –&gt; 00:12:09,560<br>you can basically simulate the queue.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:09,560 –&gt; 00:12:11,680<br>And the stack of pancakes is very similar.</p>
<p>192<br>00:12:11,680 –&gt; 00:12:17,840<br>If you think about pancakes, the first one you made is the last one you eat, right?</p>
<p>193<br>00:12:17,840 –&gt; 00:12:21,160<br>So it’s a first in, last out of a kind of situation.</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:21,160 –&gt; 00:12:29,240<br>So that means that we can still represent a stack of pancakes using a list, right?</p>
<p>195<br>00:12:29,240 –&gt; 00:12:34,639<br>So the representation, the data representation for a stack of pancakes will be the same as</p>
<p>196<br>00:12:34,639 –&gt; 00:12:38,360<br>a queue, except that the behavior will be different, right?</p>
<p>197<br>00:12:38,360 –&gt; 00:12:43,080<br>Because if I just made a new pancake and it goes at the end here, right?</p>
<p>198<br>00:12:43,080 –&gt; 00:12:46,759<br>The newest one that I made is the first one that I’m going to eat.</p>
<p>199<br>00:12:46,759 –&gt; 00:12:51,360<br>So if I add a pancake to the end of my list, I’m going to remove the pancake that I want</p>
<p>200<br>00:12:51,360 –&gt; 00:12:55,480<br>to eat from the end of my list as well.</p>
<p>201<br>00:12:55,480 –&gt; 00:12:56,480<br>Okay.</p>
<p>202<br>00:12:56,480 –&gt; 00:13:00,039<br>So the idea of object-oriented programming, and the reason we’re doing this is because now</p>
<p>203<br>00:13:00,039 –&gt; 00:13:05,200<br>we’re bundling basically data and behaviors into one thing.</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:05,200 –&gt; 00:13:12,000<br>And so we can create all of these objects that have the same type that all are going to</p>
<p>205<br>00:13:12,000 –&gt; 00:13:13,279<br>function in the same way.</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:13,279 –&gt; 00:13:15,919<br>We know they’re going to be consistent, right?</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:16,079 –&gt; 00:13:20,199<br>They’re going to be consistent in the data that represents them and consistent in the way</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:20,199 –&gt; 00:13:21,519<br>that we use them, right?</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:21,519 –&gt; 00:13:27,199<br>So we know for sure that the queue is going to be a first out kind of situation, right?</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:29,240 –&gt; 00:13:33,279<br>And the way we’re going to implement this is using these things called Python classes.</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:33,279 –&gt; 00:13:38,399<br>And the reason we create these Python classes is to make code that’s very nicely reusable.</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:38,399 –&gt; 00:13:41,799<br>We can create really simple Python classes that we’ll see today.</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:41,799 –&gt; 00:13:46,439<br>And then we can build upon these Python classes to create more complex classes,</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:46,439 –&gt; 00:13:47,719<br>which we’ll see on Wednesday.</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:49,199 –&gt; 00:13:53,240<br>But the big idea here, and this is something that I was a little bit confused about</p>
<p>216<br>00:13:53,240 –&gt; 00:13:58,439<br>when I first started and learning about object-oriented programming, is you get to be in charge</p>
<p>217<br>00:13:58,439 –&gt; 00:14:00,359<br>of the design decision, right?</p>
<p>218<br>00:14:00,359 –&gt; 00:14:06,439<br>So you get to decide what data represents the class and you decide what behaviors represent the class.</p>
<p>219<br>00:14:06,439 –&gt; 00:14:11,559<br>So if you wanted to say that, you know, you represent a queue using a list, right?</p>
<p>220<br>00:14:11,559 –&gt; 00:14:16,239<br>First in first out, if you add items to the end, you remove items from the beginning.</p>
<p>221<br>00:14:16,239 –&gt; 00:14:17,639<br>That’s one design decision.</p>
<p>222<br>00:14:17,639 –&gt; 00:14:20,919<br>Another design decision could be, well, you still represent it as a list,</p>
<p>223<br>00:14:20,919 –&gt; 00:14:24,159<br>but new items get added to the front.</p>
<p>224<br>00:14:24,159 –&gt; 00:14:27,879<br>But to be consistent with the idea of a queue, that means you remove items from the back.</p>
<p>225<br>00:14:27,879 –&gt; 00:14:30,639<br>And then the behavior is the same, right?</p>
<p>226<br>00:14:30,639 –&gt; 00:14:35,039<br>We’re implementing a queue, no matter which one of those design decisions we’ve made.</p>
<p>227<br>00:14:37,039 –&gt; 00:14:39,919<br>Okay, so as we’re going through today’s lecture,</p>
<p>228<br>00:14:39,919 –&gt; 00:14:42,279<br>I want to make a note of a couple things.</p>
<p>229<br>00:14:42,279 –&gt; 00:14:44,639<br>So I’ve got these little tabs up at the top here.</p>
<p>230<br>00:14:46,439 –&gt; 00:14:50,079<br>We’re going to be basically switching our brains a little bit today.</p>
<p>231<br>00:14:50,079 –&gt; 00:14:55,079<br>We’re going to be defining a Python object, right?</p>
<p>232<br>00:14:55,079 –&gt; 00:15:00,919<br>So we’re going to be writing code that tells Python, hey, I am telling you I would like to create this object type.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:02,120 –&gt; 00:15:07,799<br>Okay, and these are the data, these are the, this is the data that represents them, represents it,</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:07,799 –&gt; 00:15:09,559<br>and these are the behaviors that represent it.</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:09,559 –&gt; 00:15:12,119<br>So that’s us implementing the class.</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:12,119 –&gt; 00:15:15,799<br>So telling Python that we are now creating and telling you what, what,</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:15,799 –&gt; 00:15:17,719<br>what an object of this type is and does.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:18,519 –&gt; 00:15:23,479<br>And the other thing is once we have a definition for this object type,</p>
<p>239<br>00:15:23,479 –&gt; 00:15:26,599<br>we’re going to actually use the type, right?</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:26,599 –&gt; 00:15:29,759<br>We’re going to create new objects of this type.</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:30,719 –&gt; 00:15:35,759<br>So when we’re creating the class, when we’re telling Python that’s an object like this exists,</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:35,840 –&gt; 00:15:40,639<br>we’re deciding the name of our class, we’re deciding what data abstracts it,</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:40,639 –&gt; 00:15:43,519<br>we’re deciding what behaviors we can do with it, right?</p>
<p>244<br>00:15:43,519 –&gt; 00:15:47,319<br>So if you think about the list, we haven’t actually seen the code to do this,</p>
<p>245<br>00:15:47,319 –&gt; 00:15:50,759<br>but someone wrote code to define this list class.</p>
<p>246<br>00:15:52,319 –&gt; 00:15:57,519<br>Now, using the class means that we’re assuming that this code already exists, right?</p>
<p>247<br>00:15:57,519 –&gt; 00:16:00,759<br>And you’re just creating a whole bunch of objects of this type.</p>
<p>248<br>00:16:00,759 –&gt; 00:16:02,600<br>So we’ve been doing this definitely, right?</p>
<p>249<br>00:16:02,600 –&gt; 00:16:05,360<br>If we think about the list class again here, you know, for example,</p>
<p>250<br>00:16:05,360 –&gt; 00:16:08,560<br>we created an actual object that we can manipulate, right?</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:08,560 –&gt; 00:16:10,480<br>L is equal to 1 comma 2.</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:10,480 –&gt; 00:16:15,200<br>We’ve also created L is equal to 3 comma 4 comma 5 and all these things, right?</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:15,200 –&gt; 00:16:19,720<br>We’re basically creating these instances that we can manipulate and use in our program</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:19,720 –&gt; 00:16:21,759<br>to achieve something useful, right?</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:21,759 –&gt; 00:16:24,680<br>And today we’re going to see how we can do both of those things.</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:26,200 –&gt; 00:16:30,440<br>I want to draw a little parallel with functions because it’s going to feel very similar, right?</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:30,440 –&gt; 00:16:34,840<br>And with functions, when we were defining a function,</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:34,840 –&gt; 00:16:40,280<br>we were telling Python that I would like to, you know, abstract some code</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:40,280 –&gt; 00:16:45,400<br>that does something useful using this class, using this function definition, right?</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:45,400 –&gt; 00:16:50,000<br>So we were writing the definition for the function in this abstract way.</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:50,000 –&gt; 00:16:52,720<br>We didn’t actually run the function at that point, right?</p>
<p>262<br>00:16:52,720 –&gt; 00:16:54,240<br>We just defined it.</p>
<p>263<br>00:16:54,240 –&gt; 00:16:57,360<br>And so when we define a class, that’s basically what we’re doing.</p>
<p>264<br>00:16:57,360 –&gt; 00:17:02,560<br>We’re telling Python that we’re creating this object that bundles data and behaviors together.</p>
<p>265<br>00:17:04,960 –&gt; 00:17:10,480<br>When we create instances of this data type that we’re going to define,</p>
<p>266<br>00:17:10,480 –&gt; 00:17:16,000<br>that’s kind of like we called the actual function that we defined, right?</p>
<p>267<br>00:17:16,000 –&gt; 00:17:21,440<br>So when we called the function, we were now doing something useful in our program, right?</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:21,440 –&gt; 00:17:25,000<br>We said here are some actual parameters I want you to run this function with.</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:25,000 –&gt; 00:17:27,120<br>Now tell me what the output is, okay?</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:27,439 –&gt; 00:17:33,519<br>And that’s exactly what we’re going to do when we create instances of the data type we’re defining.</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:33,519 –&gt; 00:17:38,639<br>We’re now creating actual objects that we can manipulate and use in our class.</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:40,679 –&gt; 00:17:46,799<br>Okay, so the object we’re going to create in today’s lecture is a coordinate in a 2D plane.</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:48,279 –&gt; 00:17:50,240<br>Pretty simple, pretty mathematical.</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:50,240 –&gt; 00:17:53,039<br>So before we actually write the code,</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:53,039 –&gt; 00:17:58,159<br>let’s kind of think about what it actually means to put a coordinate in a 2D plane.</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:58,159 –&gt; 00:18:01,200<br>So we’re going to think about if we had a bunch of instances, right?</p>
<p>277<br>00:18:01,200 –&gt; 00:18:04,599<br>If we had a bunch of coordinates in the 2D plane, what do they look like?</p>
<p>278<br>00:18:04,599 –&gt; 00:18:08,079<br>What kind of data are we interested in, you know, grabbing from these instances?</p>
<p>279<br>00:18:08,079 –&gt; 00:18:10,039<br>What are some things we can do with it?</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:10,039 –&gt; 00:18:13,039<br>So here I have a point in my 2D plane.</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:14,319 –&gt; 00:18:19,680<br>So if we think about how we look at this, at this coordinate,</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:19,680 –&gt; 00:18:23,600<br>well, we know how far away the coordinate is on the x-axis,</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:23,600 –&gt; 00:18:27,920<br>and we know how far away the coordinate is on the y-axis, right?</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:27,920 –&gt; 00:18:31,279<br>So that’s one instance of a coordinate object.</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:31,279 –&gt; 00:18:33,560<br>Now let’s say we had another one, right?</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:33,560 –&gt; 00:18:35,720<br>Here’s another dot in my 2D plane.</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:35,720 –&gt; 00:18:39,640<br>Again, this dot will also know how far away it is on the x-axis,</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:39,640 –&gt; 00:18:43,160<br>and how far away it is on the y-axis, okay?</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:43,160 –&gt; 00:18:49,080<br>So one reasonable data abstraction for a coordinate in a 2D plane</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:49,079 –&gt; 00:18:53,279<br>could be to say I want two numbers,</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:53,279 –&gt; 00:18:56,759<br>one representing how far away it is on the x-axis,</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:56,759 –&gt; 00:18:59,839<br>and one for how far away it is on the y-axis, right?</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:59,839 –&gt; 00:19:01,199<br>That seems pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>294<br>00:19:01,199 –&gt; 00:19:03,119<br>I don’t care about color, right?</p>
<p>295<br>00:19:03,119 –&gt; 00:19:04,919<br>Even though I colored these things,</p>
<p>296<br>00:19:04,919 –&gt; 00:19:09,480<br>but you can imagine making a cuter version of this coordinate object</p>
<p>297<br>00:19:09,480 –&gt; 00:19:11,480<br>that also has a color associated with it.</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:12,480 –&gt; 00:19:16,519<br>Okay, so the data that will represent my point in a coordinate plane,</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:16,519 –&gt; 00:19:20,000<br>and a 2D coordinate plane is just two numbers, right?</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:20,000 –&gt; 00:19:21,519<br>One for the x, one for the y.</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:22,879 –&gt; 00:19:25,400<br>Now what are some things that we can do with these coordinate objects?</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:25,400 –&gt; 00:19:29,039<br>Certainly something really simple we can do is to say,</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:29,039 –&gt; 00:19:32,559<br>well, point, you know, one of these points, you know,</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:32,559 –&gt; 00:19:36,879<br>the orange one, for example, tell me how far away you are on the x-axis,</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:36,879 –&gt; 00:19:39,440<br>or tell me how far away you are on the y-axis, right?</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:39,440 –&gt; 00:19:42,799<br>So those two commands could return, you know, something like three,</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:42,799 –&gt; 00:19:45,759<br>for that’s how far away that point is on the x-axis or four,</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:45,759 –&gt; 00:19:47,680<br>for how far away it is on the y-axis.</p>
<p>309<br>00:19:49,039 –&gt; 00:19:50,440<br>Those are pretty simple things to do.</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:50,440 –&gt; 00:19:53,000<br>One more interesting thing to do is to say, well,</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:53,000 –&gt; 00:19:55,160<br>hey, you point, orange point right over there,</p>
<p>312<br>00:19:55,160 –&gt; 00:19:58,160<br>can you tell me how far away you are between the green point?</p>
<p>313<br>00:19:59,200 –&gt; 00:19:59,879<br>Right?</p>
<p>314<br>00:19:59,879 –&gt; 00:20:02,799<br>So that would be the Euclidean distance between these two points.</p>
<p>315<br>00:20:02,799 –&gt; 00:20:07,359<br>And we’re going to write code that figures out how far away</p>
<p>316<br>00:20:07,359 –&gt; 00:20:10,039<br>one coordinate object is from another coordinate object.</p>
<p>317<br>00:20:11,119 –&gt; 00:20:12,440<br>Okay.</p>
<p>318<br>00:20:12,440 –&gt; 00:20:15,640<br>All right, so let’s start defining this class coordinate.</p>
<p>319<br>00:20:15,640 –&gt; 00:20:17,360<br>We’re going to, you can see here,</p>
<p>320<br>00:20:17,360 –&gt; 00:20:19,320<br>this is the code that implements the class.</p>
<p>321<br>00:20:19,320 –&gt; 00:20:24,640<br>So this will tell Python that we are now creating this object type coordinate.</p>
<p>322<br>00:20:25,400 –&gt; 00:20:25,960<br>Okay?</p>
<p>323<br>00:20:25,960 –&gt; 00:20:27,080<br>So we’re not using it yet.</p>
<p>324<br>00:20:27,080 –&gt; 00:20:30,480<br>We’re not creating any objects, any object instances,</p>
<p>325<br>00:20:30,480 –&gt; 00:20:33,800<br>we’re just telling Python that we’d like to create this object type.</p>
<p>326<br>00:20:34,600 –&gt; 00:20:38,200<br>So we start with the keyword class, right?</p>
<p>327<br>00:20:38,200 –&gt; 00:20:41,800<br>In parallel, we started with the keyword DF to define a function.</p>
<p>328<br>00:20:41,800 –&gt; 00:20:44,440<br>Then we say the name of our object type.</p>
<p>329<br>00:20:44,440 –&gt; 00:20:47,039<br>So this will be literally the type of the object.</p>
<p>330<br>00:20:47,039 –&gt; 00:20:50,400<br>So coordinate, just like we had lists and float, you know,</p>
<p>331<br>00:20:50,400 –&gt; 00:20:52,440<br>all those things, this will be of type coordinate.</p>
<p>332<br>00:20:53,480 –&gt; 00:20:57,360<br>And then in parentheses here, we say the parent of this class.</p>
<p>333<br>00:20:57,360 –&gt; 00:21:01,200<br>So usually we say object until two lectures from now,</p>
<p>334<br>00:21:01,200 –&gt; 00:21:03,519<br>when we’re going to see what happens when we put something else in there.</p>
<p>335<br>00:21:04,200 –&gt; 00:21:06,360<br>But when we put object in the parentheses there,</p>
<p>336<br>00:21:06,360 –&gt; 00:21:10,440<br>we’re telling Python that anything a generic Python object can do,</p>
<p>337<br>00:21:11,480 –&gt; 00:21:12,680<br>our object can do as well.</p>
<p>338<br>00:21:12,759 –&gt; 00:21:21,279<br>So something really basic is saying that I’m going to create this object in memory</p>
<p>339<br>00:21:21,279 –&gt; 00:21:25,480<br>and assign a variable to it so that I get a handle for that object using this variable.</p>
<p>340<br>00:21:25,480 –&gt; 00:21:30,840<br>Something super basic, any Python object has this ability and hours will too.</p>
<p>341<br>00:21:30,840 –&gt; 00:21:33,160<br>Because I’ve put this object in the parentheses here.</p>
<p>342<br>00:21:33,160 –&gt; 00:21:34,480<br>Okay?</p>
<p>343<br>00:21:36,160 –&gt; 00:21:37,080<br>All right.</p>
<p>344<br>00:21:37,080 –&gt; 00:21:41,960<br>So now we’ve told Python we’re creating a data type called coordinate.</p>
<p>345<br>00:21:42,120 –&gt; 00:21:45,440<br>What are we going to fill in the body of this class?</p>
<p>346<br>00:21:45,440 –&gt; 00:21:48,240<br>So the things we need to fill in are going to be our attributes.</p>
<p>347<br>00:21:49,240 –&gt; 00:21:50,880<br>Now again, what makes up an object?</p>
<p>348<br>00:21:50,880 –&gt; 00:21:51,799<br>Two things.</p>
<p>349<br>00:21:51,799 –&gt; 00:21:56,480<br>The data that you want to represent this object with and the procedures,</p>
<p>350<br>00:21:56,480 –&gt; 00:22:01,559<br>aka functions, aka behaviors that you’d like this object to have.</p>
<p>351<br>00:22:01,559 –&gt; 00:22:02,519<br>Okay?</p>
<p>352<br>00:22:02,519 –&gt; 00:22:05,039<br>So the data will be two things, right?</p>
<p>353<br>00:22:05,039 –&gt; 00:22:08,759<br>We decided that we’re going to represent a coordinate using two numbers.</p>
<p>354<br>00:22:08,759 –&gt; 00:22:09,519<br>Okay?</p>
<p>355<br>00:22:09,519 –&gt; 00:22:11,440<br>Now what about behaviors?</p>
<p>356<br>00:22:11,440 –&gt; 00:22:17,960<br>Behaviors will essentially be functions that work with objects of this particular type.</p>
<p>357<br>00:22:17,960 –&gt; 00:22:19,799<br>So we’re going to define them as functions,</p>
<p>358<br>00:22:19,799 –&gt; 00:22:23,799<br>but we’re going to define them in a really special way that tells Python</p>
<p>359<br>00:22:23,799 –&gt; 00:22:28,400<br>you can only run this function on an object of type coordinate, right?</p>
<p>360<br>00:22:28,400 –&gt; 00:22:29,639<br>Which makes sense.</p>
<p>361<br>00:22:29,639 –&gt; 00:22:33,519<br>I would not like to find the distance between, you know, two integers.</p>
<p>362<br>00:22:33,519 –&gt; 00:22:36,720<br>That’s just subtraction or I would not like to find the distance between two dictionaries.</p>
<p>363<br>00:22:36,720 –&gt; 00:22:38,000<br>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>364<br>00:22:38,000 –&gt; 00:22:38,519<br>Right?</p>
<p>365<br>00:22:38,519 –&gt; 00:22:42,240<br>So distance method that we mentioned is one thing we’d like to implement</p>
<p>366<br>00:22:42,240 –&gt; 00:22:45,119<br>will only work with objects of type coordinate.</p>
<p>367<br>00:22:45,119 –&gt; 00:22:46,200<br>Okay.</p>
<p>368<br>00:22:46,200 –&gt; 00:22:49,759<br>So these special functions are actually called methods.</p>
<p>369<br>00:22:49,759 –&gt; 00:22:50,400<br>Okay?</p>
<p>370<br>00:22:50,400 –&gt; 00:22:53,400<br>And I’m going to use this term a little bit today.</p>
<p>371<br>00:22:53,400 –&gt; 00:22:54,599<br>Hopefully you get used to it.</p>
<p>372<br>00:22:54,599 –&gt; 00:22:57,440<br>And then from now, from there, from next lecture on,</p>
<p>373<br>00:22:57,440 –&gt; 00:23:02,000<br>I’ll just use the word methods to refer to functions that only work with objects of this time.</p>
<p>374<br>00:23:03,920 –&gt; 00:23:04,440<br>Okay.</p>
<p>375<br>00:23:04,440 –&gt; 00:23:09,680<br>So we so far in the previous slide had class coordinate object.</p>
<p>376<br>00:23:09,680 –&gt; 00:23:12,519<br>Now, what is the next thing you have to do?</p>
<p>377<br>00:23:12,519 –&gt; 00:23:17,519<br>So the next thing you always have to do when you tell Python you’re creating a new data type,</p>
<p>378<br>00:23:17,519 –&gt; 00:23:21,799<br>is to tell Python how you want to construct this data type.</p>
<p>379<br>00:23:21,799 –&gt; 00:23:22,799<br>Okay?</p>
<p>380<br>00:23:22,799 –&gt; 00:23:23,840<br>Okay.</p>
<p>381<br>00:23:23,840 –&gt; 00:23:27,680<br>Kind of a constructor, a constructor function.</p>
<p>382<br>00:23:27,680 –&gt; 00:23:32,519<br>And the way we do this is by defining, so you can see we’re defining it like a function,</p>
<p>383<br>00:23:32,519 –&gt; 00:23:37,160<br>DF, but we’re going to define a function that has a special name.</p>
<p>384<br>00:23:37,160 –&gt; 00:23:40,480<br>And the name is double underscore in it, double underscore.</p>
<p>385<br>00:23:41,839 –&gt; 00:23:42,839<br>Okay?</p>
<p>386<br>00:23:42,839 –&gt; 00:23:44,680<br>So that’s the name of this function.</p>
<p>387<br>00:23:44,680 –&gt; 00:23:47,799<br>And you can see it’s a function, DF name, and then parentheses.</p>
<p>388<br>00:23:47,799 –&gt; 00:23:49,920<br>And there’s a bunch of stuff in the parentheses.</p>
<p>389<br>00:23:49,920 –&gt; 00:23:52,799<br>The first thing will be this thing called self.</p>
<p>390<br>00:23:52,799 –&gt; 00:23:57,359<br>So already it’s going to be a little bit different than regular functions.</p>
<p>391<br>00:23:57,359 –&gt; 00:24:01,559<br>Now, I’m going to, this is not the only time I’ll explain self.</p>
<p>392<br>00:24:01,559 –&gt; 00:24:04,039<br>I’ll explain it throughout this lecture.</p>
<p>393<br>00:24:04,039 –&gt; 00:24:10,599<br>But the basic idea of self is that it’s always going to be the first parameter of a method,</p>
<p>394<br>00:24:10,599 –&gt; 00:24:11,599<br>right?</p>
<p>395<br>00:24:11,599 –&gt; 00:24:14,559<br>A function that only works with an object of this class, of this type.</p>
<p>396<br>00:24:16,119 –&gt; 00:24:21,279<br>And the reason why we have it here is because all we’re doing here is telling</p>
<p>397<br>00:24:21,279 –&gt; 00:24:24,960<br>Python that we’d like to create this object type.</p>
<p>398<br>00:24:24,960 –&gt; 00:24:28,240<br>We don’t have an actual object to manipulate, right?</p>
<p>399<br>00:24:28,240 –&gt; 00:24:30,839<br>I haven’t created an actual object yet.</p>
<p>400<br>00:24:30,839 –&gt; 00:24:34,359<br>I’m just telling Python I’d like to create this object.</p>
<p>401<br>00:24:34,359 –&gt; 00:24:42,039<br>So if I don’t have an actual object created yet, I need some way to refer to an instance</p>
<p>402<br>00:24:42,039 –&gt; 00:24:44,240<br>without actually having one yet.</p>
<p>403<br>00:24:44,240 –&gt; 00:24:46,839<br>And that’s what the self is doing, right?</p>
<p>404<br>00:24:46,839 –&gt; 00:24:53,480<br>It’s basically a variable that tells Python that this is an object of, that this is a function</p>
<p>405<br>00:24:53,480 –&gt; 00:24:55,799<br>that only works with an object of this type.</p>
<p>406<br>00:24:55,799 –&gt; 00:25:03,680<br>And I’m going to use this variable self to refer to this object myself, my data attributes</p>
<p>407<br>00:25:03,680 –&gt; 00:25:06,639<br>and my methods and things like that.</p>
<p>408<br>00:25:06,639 –&gt; 00:25:07,639<br>So we’ll become clear.</p>
<p>409<br>00:25:07,639 –&gt; 00:25:08,639<br>There will be many examples.</p>
<p>410<br>00:25:08,639 –&gt; 00:25:13,919<br>But for now, it’s basically a way for us to refer to an object of this type, an instance</p>
<p>411<br>00:25:13,919 –&gt; 00:25:17,720<br>of this type without actually having created one.</p>
<p>412<br>00:25:17,720 –&gt; 00:25:23,559<br>Anything after self is basically parameters you’d like to create this object with.</p>
<p>413<br>00:25:23,559 –&gt; 00:25:29,799<br>So for us, it doesn’t make sense to say create this coordinate object without actually initializing</p>
<p>414<br>00:25:29,799 –&gt; 00:25:31,839<br>its x and y values, right?</p>
<p>415<br>00:25:31,839 –&gt; 00:25:36,240<br>When we put a coordinate object in a 2D plane, I would like to put it in that 2D plane.</p>
<p>416<br>00:25:36,240 –&gt; 00:25:40,000<br>So it needs an initial x and initial y value.</p>
<p>417<br>00:25:40,000 –&gt; 00:25:44,119<br>So these parameters here will tell Python you need to pass in a value for x and y when</p>
<p>418<br>00:25:44,119 –&gt; 00:25:46,480<br>you create your object.</p>
<p>419<br>00:25:46,480 –&gt; 00:25:53,039<br>And then the body of this in it will have whatever you’d like, whatever code you’d like</p>
<p>420<br>00:25:53,039 –&gt; 00:25:55,039<br>to initialize your object.</p>
<p>421<br>00:25:55,039 –&gt; 00:25:56,039<br>Yes, question.</p>
<p>422<br>00:25:56,039 –&gt; 00:26:02,359<br>Is the way you use the underscore that like part of the right instance?</p>
<p>423<br>00:26:02,359 –&gt; 00:26:04,039<br>The underscore is part of how you write it.</p>
<p>424<br>00:26:04,039 –&gt; 00:26:07,039<br>So you have to have underscore underscore in it, underscore underscore.</p>
<p>425<br>00:26:07,039 –&gt; 00:26:08,639<br>Yeah, it’s a special function.</p>
<p>426<br>00:26:08,639 –&gt; 00:26:09,639<br>We’ll talk about the next lecture.</p>
<p>427<br>00:26:09,639 –&gt; 00:26:12,240<br>It’s called a dunder function.</p>
<p>428<br>00:26:12,240 –&gt; 00:26:15,839<br>Double underscore function, dunder.</p>
<p>429<br>00:26:15,839 –&gt; 00:26:16,839<br>Okay.</p>
<p>430<br>00:26:16,839 –&gt; 00:26:17,839<br>Okay.</p>
<p>431<br>00:26:17,839 –&gt; 00:26:21,119<br>So the body of this function can contain a bunch of initialization codes.</p>
<p>432<br>00:26:21,119 –&gt; 00:26:25,319<br>So anything you’d like to initialize when you create an object of this type, that’s</p>
<p>433<br>00:26:25,319 –&gt; 00:26:27,479<br>what you stick in here.</p>
<p>434<br>00:26:27,479 –&gt; 00:26:28,479<br>Okay.</p>
<p>435<br>00:26:28,479 –&gt; 00:26:33,759<br>Usually most of the time, 99% of the time, you want to initialize the data that makes up</p>
<p>436<br>00:26:33,759 –&gt; 00:26:35,359<br>your object, right?</p>
<p>437<br>00:26:35,359 –&gt; 00:26:40,359<br>So the data we decided makes up our object is how far you are in the x-axis and how far</p>
<p>438<br>00:26:40,359 –&gt; 00:26:42,399<br>you are in the y-axis.</p>
<p>439<br>00:26:42,399 –&gt; 00:26:48,519<br>So here, this data that I want every single one of my objects to have, a value for x and</p>
<p>440<br>00:26:48,519 –&gt; 00:26:53,440<br>the value for y, is initialized using self dot, right?</p>
<p>441<br>00:26:53,440 –&gt; 00:26:58,400<br>So self dot, a variable named x, and self dot, a variable named y.</p>
<p>442<br>00:26:58,400 –&gt; 00:27:06,000<br>And the self dot, before these variables, distinguishes these variables x and y here from regular</p>
<p>443<br>00:27:06,000 –&gt; 00:27:07,000<br>variables, right?</p>
<p>444<br>00:27:07,000 –&gt; 00:27:12,879<br>If I were to just say x equals x, and y equals y, x and y will just be regular variables.</p>
<p>445<br>00:27:12,879 –&gt; 00:27:16,319<br>As soon as my init function terminates, those variables are gone.</p>
<p>446<br>00:27:16,319 –&gt; 00:27:22,079<br>Well, because I’ve got self dot x and self dot y, this means that these values x and</p>
<p>447<br>00:27:22,079 –&gt; 00:27:28,480<br>y will persist throughout the lifetime of my object when I create my actual object.</p>
<p>448<br>00:27:28,480 –&gt; 00:27:33,359<br>And every single object I create will have their own x and y values.</p>
<p>449<br>00:27:33,359 –&gt; 00:27:34,359<br>Question?</p>
<p>450<br>00:27:34,359 –&gt; 00:27:41,359<br>Does it have to be different to the x-axis, so kind of the same thing as x-axis?</p>
<p>451<br>00:27:42,199 –&gt; 00:27:42,879<br>Good question.</p>
<p>452<br>00:27:42,879 –&gt; 00:27:46,719<br>Does this self dot thing have to be different?</p>
<p>453<br>00:27:46,719 –&gt; 00:27:52,679<br>It does not have to be, so you can have self dot x value equals x-value, and self dot y value equals y-value.</p>
<p>454<br>00:27:52,679 –&gt; 00:27:56,599<br>The reason I did it here is to showcase that they actually do not have to be the same.</p>
<p>455<br>00:27:56,599 –&gt; 00:27:59,839<br>Yeah, they are completely different, right?</p>
<p>456<br>00:27:59,839 –&gt; 00:28:02,639<br>So self dot x is different than x-value.</p>
<p>457<br>00:28:02,639 –&gt; 00:28:06,559<br>We’re just happened to be assigning this value to be whatever is pasted.</p>
<p>458<br>00:28:06,559 –&gt; 00:28:09,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>459<br>00:28:09,279 –&gt; 00:28:17,879<br>So a little bit of a kind of, again, just kind of explaining what this self is in the context of a blueprint.</p>
<p>460<br>00:28:17,879 –&gt; 00:28:20,000<br>So if we think about a blueprint in real life, right?</p>
<p>461<br>00:28:20,000 –&gt; 00:28:24,319<br>So here I have a blueprint for a room that I might want to create.</p>
<p>462<br>00:28:24,319 –&gt; 00:28:26,519<br>I don’t actually have this room created yet, right?</p>
<p>463<br>00:28:26,519 –&gt; 00:28:28,480<br>It’s just an idea.</p>
<p>464<br>00:28:28,480 –&gt; 00:28:40,319<br>But what I know is that I’m going to use this blueprint to have a room that contains two chairs, a coffee table, and a sofa.</p>
<p>465<br>00:28:40,319 –&gt; 00:28:45,519<br>So in this blueprint, I don’t have actual rooms that I’ve implemented this thing in.</p>
<p>466<br>00:28:45,519 –&gt; 00:28:49,559<br>I don’t have actual rooms where I’ve put two chairs, a coffee table, and a sofa in.</p>
<p>467<br>00:28:49,559 –&gt; 00:28:51,759<br>It’s just an idea.</p>
<p>468<br>00:28:51,759 –&gt; 00:28:57,960<br>But self is kind of the way that a blueprint accesses its attributes.</p>
<p>469<br>00:28:57,960 –&gt; 00:29:08,960<br>So I’ve got, if I say self dot coffee table, that means if in the future I have an actual room, self dot coffee table means I’m referring to that room’s coffee table.</p>
<p>470<br>00:29:08,960 –&gt; 00:29:10,960<br>Okay.</p>
<p>471<br>00:29:10,960 –&gt; 00:29:24,960<br>So the self is a variable that we used to refer to data or to attributes for a blueprint when I don’t have actual rooms created.</p>
<p>472<br>00:29:24,960 –&gt; 00:29:27,840<br>But once I create instances of rooms, right?</p>
<p>473<br>00:29:27,840 –&gt; 00:29:31,640<br>So for example, here I have something called living room created, right?</p>
<p>474<br>00:29:31,640 –&gt; 00:29:36,440<br>So I’ve taken my blueprint and now somebody asked me to create a room with this blueprint, right?</p>
<p>475<br>00:29:36,440 –&gt; 00:29:40,680<br>Now I no longer use self because I have an actual room in hand.</p>
<p>476<br>00:29:40,680 –&gt; 00:29:47,840<br>So now I would refer to coffee table in this living room as living room dot coffee table or living room’s coffee table, right?</p>
<p>477<br>00:29:47,840 –&gt; 00:29:49,600<br>No longer self’s coffee table.</p>
<p>478<br>00:29:49,600 –&gt; 00:29:53,279<br>So self is only used in the context of my blueprint.</p>
<p>479<br>00:29:53,279 –&gt; 00:29:54,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>480<br>00:29:54,440 –&gt; 00:30:04,720<br>And to sort of bring the last point home, the idea that with the blueprint you can create many different instances, well, here’s a living room that I’ve applied my blueprint to.</p>
<p>481<br>00:30:04,720 –&gt; 00:30:09,759<br>And here’s another living room, completely different room that somebody asked me to use my blueprint for to create it.</p>
<p>482<br>00:30:09,759 –&gt; 00:30:13,480<br>Different chairs, different coffee tables, different colored things.</p>
<p>483<br>00:30:13,480 –&gt; 00:30:19,639<br>These are all different instances that I used my one template, my one blueprint for the room on.</p>
<p>484<br>00:30:19,639 –&gt; 00:30:20,639<br>Okay.</p>
<p>485<br>00:30:20,640 –&gt; 00:30:24,160<br>So when we’re defining the class, we don’t have actual objects, right?</p>
<p>486<br>00:30:24,160 –&gt; 00:30:26,800<br>Again, that’s just kind of a really big idea here.</p>
<p>487<br>00:30:26,800 –&gt; 00:30:30,680<br>We’re just telling Python, I’d like to create this object and this is what it looks like.</p>
<p>488<br>00:30:30,680 –&gt; 00:30:36,000<br>I’m bundling this data with these behaviors together, but I don’t have actual objects of this type created yet.</p>
<p>489<br>00:30:37,200 –&gt; 00:30:39,360<br>So let’s actually create some objects.</p>
<p>490<br>00:30:39,360 –&gt; 00:30:42,520<br>The code that does this is as follows.</p>
<p>491<br>00:30:42,520 –&gt; 00:30:49,120<br>So I’ve put the definition for my class, the constructor, the init method for my class up here,</p>
<p>492<br>00:30:49,119 –&gt; 00:30:51,679<br>just to remind us what it looks like.</p>
<p>493<br>00:30:51,679 –&gt; 00:30:56,439<br>And with that code, we can now start to create actual objects that we can manipulate.</p>
<p>494<br>00:30:56,439 –&gt; 00:31:01,959<br>So when we created something like, you know, L is equal to one square bracket lists, one comma two.</p>
<p>495<br>00:31:01,959 –&gt; 00:31:06,639<br>Now I’m creating these actual coordinates in my code using my blueprint.</p>
<p>496<br>00:31:06,639 –&gt; 00:31:09,599<br>So the way we do that is we invoke the name of our class.</p>
<p>497<br>00:31:10,799 –&gt; 00:31:13,039<br>So you say coordinate, that’s what we named it, right?</p>
<p>498<br>00:31:13,039 –&gt; 00:31:14,519<br>That’s our data type.</p>
<p>499<br>00:31:14,519 –&gt; 00:31:18,719<br>And here I’m passing in every single parameter except for self.</p>
<p>500<br>00:31:18,720 –&gt; 00:31:23,680<br>So I initialized a coordinate object using x, val, and y, val.</p>
<p>501<br>00:31:23,680 –&gt; 00:31:27,160<br>So I need to put in two parameters here for x, val, and y, val.</p>
<p>502<br>00:31:28,319 –&gt; 00:31:34,120<br>And self actually becomes this thing that I just created, this object.</p>
<p>503<br>00:31:35,240 –&gt; 00:31:40,839<br>So coordinate three comma four is now an object that’s being referenced by variable named C.</p>
<p>504<br>00:31:42,839 –&gt; 00:31:45,160<br>Which is why I’m not passing in self.</p>
<p>505<br>00:31:45,160 –&gt; 00:31:47,480<br>So it’s kind of weird to think about.</p>
<p>506<br>00:31:47,480 –&gt; 00:31:51,240<br>But now I have one object in memory, it’s referenced by name C.</p>
<p>507<br>00:31:51,240 –&gt; 00:31:54,519<br>And on the next line, I have another object in memory.</p>
<p>508<br>00:31:54,519 –&gt; 00:31:57,200<br>Again, I’ve invoked the name of my class coordinate.</p>
<p>509<br>00:31:57,200 –&gt; 00:32:01,120<br>This particular object, x value will be zero and y value will be zero.</p>
<p>510<br>00:32:01,120 –&gt; 00:32:05,680<br>So different than the one I just did on the previous line.</p>
<p>511<br>00:32:05,680 –&gt; 00:32:07,799<br>But they’ll have the same structure.</p>
<p>512<br>00:32:07,799 –&gt; 00:32:10,640<br>So they will both have some x and y value.</p>
<p>513<br>00:32:10,640 –&gt; 00:32:12,960<br>They’ll just be different from each other.</p>
<p>514<br>00:32:12,960 –&gt; 00:32:15,599<br>But they’ll both have x and they’ll both have y.</p>
<p>515<br>00:32:15,599 –&gt; 00:32:19,359<br>The one I’ve named down here is going to be a origin.</p>
<p>516<br>00:32:19,359 –&gt; 00:32:21,439<br>So I’ve got two objects of type coordinate.</p>
<p>517<br>00:32:21,439 –&gt; 00:32:25,399<br>One is referenced by C, by name C, and the other one is referenced by name origin.</p>
<p>518<br>00:32:26,759 –&gt; 00:32:31,599<br>So now that I have these objects in hand, I can access any of their attributes.</p>
<p>519<br>00:32:31,599 –&gt; 00:32:35,679<br>And Python will grab for me the attribute of that particular object.</p>
<p>520<br>00:32:36,719 –&gt; 00:32:41,399<br>So here I’ve got this thing called Donotation, which we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>521<br>00:32:41,399 –&gt; 00:32:44,719<br>And I’ll explain it again in a couple slides.</p>
<p>522<br>00:32:44,720 –&gt; 00:32:51,279<br>But the Donotation tells Python to access the x data attribute of object C.</p>
<p>523<br>00:32:52,759 –&gt; 00:32:57,759<br>So this will grab for me the x value of C3, right?</p>
<p>524<br>00:32:57,759 –&gt; 00:33:01,759<br>And the next line will grab for me the x value of origin, zero.</p>
<p>525<br>00:33:03,839 –&gt; 00:33:09,839<br>And this is all made possible because x, and we could also access y,</p>
<p>526<br>00:33:09,839 –&gt; 00:33:14,400<br>x and y were defined in the class definition using self dot.</p>
<p>527<br>00:33:14,400 –&gt; 00:33:17,400<br>If I didn’t use self dot, those would just be variables.</p>
<p>528<br>00:33:17,400 –&gt; 00:33:22,120<br>And as soon as I created my object, they would have gone away because that function had terminated.</p>
<p>529<br>00:33:22,120 –&gt; 00:33:27,400<br>But in order to have these variables x and y persist throughout the lifetime of my object,</p>
<p>530<br>00:33:27,400 –&gt; 00:33:30,800<br>I’ve defined them using self dot x and self dot y.</p>
<p>531<br>00:33:30,800 –&gt; 00:33:35,320<br>So any object I’ve created that’s of type coordinate will have some value for x and</p>
<p>532<br>00:33:35,320 –&gt; 00:33:36,800<br>some value for y.</p>
<p>533<br>00:33:36,800 –&gt; 00:33:39,120<br>So we can access that value through this notation.</p>
<p>534<br>00:33:40,480 –&gt; 00:33:41,680<br>Does that make sense so far?</p>
<p>535<br>00:33:41,680 –&gt; 00:33:42,200<br>Is that all right?</p>
<p>536<br>00:33:44,600 –&gt; 00:33:45,600<br>OK.</p>
<p>537<br>00:33:46,600 –&gt; 00:33:49,680<br>So we’re going to visualize this in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>538<br>00:33:49,680 –&gt; 00:33:56,600<br>So the exact same code as on a previous slide, we’re now going to do it in our little memory type.</p>
<p>539<br>00:33:56,600 –&gt; 00:34:01,280<br>So here I have C is equal to coordinate 3, 4, exactly what I had on the previous slide.</p>
<p>540<br>00:34:01,280 –&gt; 00:34:06,800<br>So in memory, the way you think about it is, as we’ve been thinking about other objects,</p>
<p>541<br>00:34:06,800 –&gt; 00:34:07,800<br>it’s not much different.</p>
<p>542<br>00:34:07,800 –&gt; 00:34:10,519<br>We have C is our name, right?</p>
<p>543<br>00:34:10,519 –&gt; 00:34:13,079<br>And it’s bound to an object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>544<br>00:34:13,079 –&gt; 00:34:17,000<br>It just so happens, we define this object, but it’s the same idea.</p>
<p>545<br>00:34:17,000 –&gt; 00:34:19,279<br>I’ve got a name bound to some object.</p>
<p>546<br>00:34:19,279 –&gt; 00:34:23,159<br>And this object has its own x value and its own y value.</p>
<p>547<br>00:34:25,000 –&gt; 00:34:29,799<br>So when you evaluate C dot x, Python goes into memory, it says, hey, what type is C?</p>
<p>548<br>00:34:29,799 –&gt; 00:34:31,519<br>And it says, oh, it’s a coordinate object.</p>
<p>549<br>00:34:31,519 –&gt; 00:34:34,400<br>Does coordinate object have a data attribute named x?</p>
<p>550<br>00:34:34,400 –&gt; 00:34:36,799<br>Yes, it does because it looks at the init.</p>
<p>551<br>00:34:36,799 –&gt; 00:34:38,519<br>And then it says, well, what’s its value?</p>
<p>552<br>00:34:38,519 –&gt; 00:34:39,199<br>It’s 3.</p>
<p>553<br>00:34:39,199 –&gt; 00:34:40,400<br>And so it just returns that.</p>
<p>554<br>00:34:40,920 –&gt; 00:34:51,920<br>And so the next three lines here are slightly different from two slides ago, but very similar.</p>
<p>555<br>00:34:51,920 –&gt; 00:34:57,920<br>A is equal to zero, creates for me a variable named A bound to the value zero, right?</p>
<p>556<br>00:34:57,920 –&gt; 00:35:03,440<br>Just to showcase that it’s exactly the same as having a variable named C bound to this object that we created.</p>
<p>557<br>00:35:03,440 –&gt; 00:35:09,880<br>And then when I say, or rig equals coordinate a comma A, Python says, all right,</p>
<p>558<br>00:35:09,880 –&gt; 00:35:13,640<br>well, here’s a name, or rig, or origin.</p>
<p>559<br>00:35:13,640 –&gt; 00:35:15,440<br>What is it bound to?</p>
<p>560<br>00:35:15,440 –&gt; 00:35:18,559<br>Well, it’s also bound to an object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>561<br>00:35:18,559 –&gt; 00:35:21,280<br>And it’s an object we defined.</p>
<p>562<br>00:35:21,280 –&gt; 00:35:24,880<br>So we defined an object of type coordinate having an x and y value.</p>
<p>563<br>00:35:24,880 –&gt; 00:35:27,960<br>So here they are, and they’re originally zero.</p>
<p>564<br>00:35:27,960 –&gt; 00:35:30,480<br>They’re set to zero when I created this object.</p>
<p>565<br>00:35:30,480 –&gt; 00:35:34,200<br>So when I say or rig dot x, Python will look up or rig.</p>
<p>566<br>00:35:34,200 –&gt; 00:35:36,280<br>It’s going to say, hey, what type are you?</p>
<p>567<br>00:35:36,280 –&gt; 00:35:37,400<br>Oh, you’re a coordinate.</p>
<p>568<br>00:35:37,400 –&gt; 00:35:39,240<br>Do you have an x value?</p>
<p>569<br>00:35:39,239 –&gt; 00:35:41,239<br>You do. That’s what we define in the init.</p>
<p>570<br>00:35:41,239 –&gt; 00:35:42,599<br>Let me grab that value from you.</p>
<p>571<br>00:35:47,879 –&gt; 00:35:50,399<br>So we’re just manipulating objects in memory, right?</p>
<p>572<br>00:35:50,399 –&gt; 00:35:54,239<br>Now that we’ve written the code to work with objects that we created,</p>
<p>573<br>00:35:54,239 –&gt; 00:35:56,679<br>we’re just creating a whole bunch of these objects in memory,</p>
<p>574<br>00:35:56,679 –&gt; 00:36:00,159<br>and then grabbing the x values, and then we’re going to get the distance</p>
<p>575<br>00:36:00,159 –&gt; 00:36:04,279<br>between two objects in a bit.</p>
<p>576<br>00:36:04,280 –&gt; 00:36:10,240<br>One more way to show you that exact same code is to visualize it.</p>
<p>577<br>00:36:10,240 –&gt; 00:36:17,800<br>So here is the entire code as you would have it in a file.</p>
<p>578<br>00:36:17,800 –&gt; 00:36:20,240<br>So you would have all this all together.</p>
<p>579<br>00:36:20,240 –&gt; 00:36:24,880<br>The gray box is the definition for my object type.</p>
<p>580<br>00:36:24,880 –&gt; 00:36:30,400<br>And the blue box is me using this object that I just created.</p>
<p>581<br>00:36:30,400 –&gt; 00:36:33,160<br>I’ve just separated that out just for clarity.</p>
<p>582<br>00:36:33,159 –&gt; 00:36:37,119<br>So when I have my gray box, there’s nothing to display, right?</p>
<p>583<br>00:36:37,119 –&gt; 00:36:40,639<br>It just sits in memory.</p>
<p>584<br>00:36:40,639 –&gt; 00:36:43,199<br>And Python knows of this type of class coordinate</p>
<p>585<br>00:36:43,199 –&gt; 00:36:45,119<br>that has two data attributes, the things</p>
<p>586<br>00:36:45,119 –&gt; 00:36:46,920<br>that I’ve defined using self.</p>
<p>587<br>00:36:46,920 –&gt; 00:36:48,480<br>x and y.</p>
<p>588<br>00:36:48,480 –&gt; 00:36:51,440<br>When I create c is equal to coordinate 3, 4,</p>
<p>589<br>00:36:51,440 –&gt; 00:36:53,199<br>visualizing what we’re trying to do here.</p>
<p>590<br>00:36:53,199 –&gt; 00:36:56,039<br>Here I’ve got this object whose name is c,</p>
<p>591<br>00:36:56,039 –&gt; 00:36:58,239<br>and it’s at 3,4.</p>
<p>592<br>00:36:58,239 –&gt; 00:37:01,519<br>And then I’ve got this object named the origin,</p>
<p>593<br>00:37:01,519 –&gt; 00:37:05,079<br>and it’s x and y values are 0, 0.</p>
<p>594<br>00:37:05,079 –&gt; 00:37:08,440<br>So because I’ve created these objects using the same blueprint,</p>
<p>595<br>00:37:08,440 –&gt; 00:37:11,360<br>the coordinate blueprint that I’ve defined up in the gray,</p>
<p>596<br>00:37:11,360 –&gt; 00:37:13,440<br>that means every object that I’ve created,</p>
<p>597<br>00:37:13,440 –&gt; 00:37:18,400<br>c and origin, has a self.x and self.y value.</p>
<p>598<br>00:37:18,400 –&gt; 00:37:21,639<br>It just so happens that the actual values for x and y</p>
<p>599<br>00:37:21,639 –&gt; 00:37:25,679<br>are different between these two objects.</p>
<p>600<br>00:37:25,679 –&gt; 00:37:29,320<br>So when I grab origin.x, I’m looking up origin,</p>
<p>601<br>00:37:29,320 –&gt; 00:37:31,880<br>and I’m grabbing its x value, 0.</p>
<p>602<br>00:37:31,880 –&gt; 00:37:35,960<br>Just another way to visualize it.</p>
<p>603<br>00:37:35,960 –&gt; 00:37:37,240<br>OK.</p>
<p>604<br>00:37:37,240 –&gt; 00:37:39,880<br>Is everyone OK with these data attributes?</p>
<p>605<br>00:37:39,880 –&gt; 00:37:41,559<br>All right.</p>
<p>606<br>00:37:41,559 –&gt; 00:37:44,240<br>So now let’s add a method.</p>
<p>607<br>00:37:44,240 –&gt; 00:37:48,840<br>So a method, remember, is just a function that works with an object</p>
<p>608<br>00:37:48,840 –&gt; 00:37:51,240<br>of this type.</p>
<p>609<br>00:37:51,240 –&gt; 00:37:53,840<br>So the way that we tell Python, we’d</p>
<p>610<br>00:37:53,840 –&gt; 00:37:58,480<br>like to create a method, is by passing in self</p>
<p>611<br>00:37:58,480 –&gt; 00:38:00,800<br>as the first parameter.</p>
<p>612<br>00:38:00,800 –&gt; 00:38:06,240<br>So let’s create this function named distance.</p>
<p>613<br>00:38:06,240 –&gt; 00:38:08,360<br>If you look in the actual Python code for today,</p>
<p>614<br>00:38:08,360 –&gt; 00:38:12,079<br>I’ve got two more functions, one to get the x value</p>
<p>615<br>00:38:12,079 –&gt; 00:38:14,719<br>of this current object and one to get the y value.</p>
<p>616<br>00:38:14,719 –&gt; 00:38:16,240<br>But those are not as interesting.</p>
<p>617<br>00:38:16,240 –&gt; 00:38:19,760<br>This distance one is interesting now.</p>
<p>618<br>00:38:19,760 –&gt; 00:38:24,079<br>So I would like to create this function that only works</p>
<p>619<br>00:38:24,079 –&gt; 00:38:26,039<br>with an object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>620<br>00:38:26,039 –&gt; 00:38:28,519<br>So what we’ve done so far is these lines up here.</p>
<p>621<br>00:38:28,519 –&gt; 00:38:31,000<br>So now we’ve got df, again, it’s just a function.</p>
<p>622<br>00:38:31,000 –&gt; 00:38:36,400<br>So we’ve got def, name of it, distance, and then the parameters.</p>
<p>623<br>00:38:36,400 –&gt; 00:38:39,119<br>So again, since this is a function that only works with an object</p>
<p>624<br>00:38:39,119 –&gt; 00:38:44,079<br>of type coordinate, I need to put self as the first parameter.</p>
<p>625<br>00:38:44,079 –&gt; 00:38:48,759<br>And this self will help us refer to the object</p>
<p>626<br>00:38:48,759 –&gt; 00:38:51,759<br>when I call the method on it.</p>
<p>627<br>00:38:51,759 –&gt; 00:38:53,800<br>So if self is the first parameter,</p>
<p>628<br>00:38:53,800 –&gt; 00:38:59,240<br>that means that this distance method will be called on self.</p>
<p>629<br>00:38:59,240 –&gt; 00:39:02,400<br>So when I have an actual object in hand</p>
<p>630<br>00:39:02,400 –&gt; 00:39:05,680<br>that I’m calling distance on the self parameter,</p>
<p>631<br>00:39:05,680 –&gt; 00:39:08,080<br>we’ll take on the value that is that object.</p>
<p>632<br>00:39:08,080 –&gt; 00:39:11,039<br>We’re going to see this in the next slide.</p>
<p>633<br>00:39:11,039 –&gt; 00:39:13,760<br>So self is the thing that I’m calling this function on.</p>
<p>634<br>00:39:13,760 –&gt; 00:39:18,519<br>And then what other parameters do I want to give to this function?</p>
<p>635<br>00:39:18,519 –&gt; 00:39:21,720<br>Well, I want to find the distance between myself.</p>
<p>636<br>00:39:21,719 –&gt; 00:39:24,480<br>So this object that I’m going to call distance on,</p>
<p>637<br>00:39:24,480 –&gt; 00:39:27,639<br>and another coordinate object.</p>
<p>638<br>00:39:27,639 –&gt; 00:39:35,239<br>Now, other than maybe a doc string here that says, hey, warning,</p>
<p>639<br>00:39:35,239 –&gt; 00:39:37,879<br>others should be an object of type coordinate,</p>
<p>640<br>00:39:37,879 –&gt; 00:39:42,279<br>there isn’t really anything that enforces the type of other</p>
<p>641<br>00:39:42,279 –&gt; 00:39:45,799<br>when you make a function call or when you make a method call.</p>
<p>642<br>00:39:45,799 –&gt; 00:39:48,799<br>So you can call this distance method</p>
<p>643<br>00:39:48,799 –&gt; 00:39:51,279<br>with other being an integer, which</p>
<p>644<br>00:39:51,280 –&gt; 00:39:53,440<br>is not an object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>645<br>00:39:53,440 –&gt; 00:39:56,440<br>The code will run, but will immediately crash</p>
<p>646<br>00:39:56,440 –&gt; 00:39:59,360<br>because of what’s going on inside.</p>
<p>647<br>00:39:59,360 –&gt; 00:40:01,480<br>So the only way this code will work</p>
<p>648<br>00:40:01,480 –&gt; 00:40:04,720<br>is if you’re calling it on an object of type coordinate</p>
<p>649<br>00:40:04,720 –&gt; 00:40:06,560<br>for the other.</p>
<p>650<br>00:40:06,560 –&gt; 00:40:09,400<br>So the reason for that is because when we think about grabbing</p>
<p>651<br>00:40:09,400 –&gt; 00:40:12,480<br>the distance between two objects that are coordinates in a 2D</p>
<p>652<br>00:40:12,480 –&gt; 00:40:16,840<br>plane, we take the difference between the x values,</p>
<p>653<br>00:40:16,840 –&gt; 00:40:19,600<br>square, a square that, take the difference between the y values,</p>
<p>654<br>00:40:19,599 –&gt; 00:40:22,880<br>square that, right, Pythagoras, add those two together,</p>
<p>655<br>00:40:22,880 –&gt; 00:40:25,400<br>take the square root.</p>
<p>656<br>00:40:25,400 –&gt; 00:40:28,279<br>So if I’m calling this distance method</p>
<p>657<br>00:40:28,279 –&gt; 00:40:31,599<br>on an object of type coordinate, i.e. self,</p>
<p>658<br>00:40:31,599 –&gt; 00:40:34,639<br>how do I grab myself’s x value?</p>
<p>659<br>00:40:34,639 –&gt; 00:40:37,360<br>Well, I just say self.x, right?</p>
<p>660<br>00:40:37,360 –&gt; 00:40:39,679<br>My x value, what is it?</p>
<p>661<br>00:40:39,679 –&gt; 00:40:41,960<br>And then I would like to subtract that</p>
<p>662<br>00:40:41,960 –&gt; 00:40:46,000<br>from the other coordinate objects, x value.</p>
<p>663<br>00:40:46,000 –&gt; 00:40:47,239<br>What’s my other coordinate object?</p>
<p>664<br>00:40:47,239 –&gt; 00:40:49,919<br>It’s the thing that I’m passing in as a parameter.</p>
<p>665<br>00:40:49,919 –&gt; 00:40:52,279<br>So grab their x value.</p>
<p>666<br>00:40:52,279 –&gt; 00:40:56,399<br>So if I take self.x minus other.x, Python will grab my x value,</p>
<p>667<br>00:40:56,399 –&gt; 00:41:00,079<br>subtract it from others x value, square that.</p>
<p>668<br>00:41:00,079 –&gt; 00:41:02,359<br>We do the exact same thing with y, right?</p>
<p>669<br>00:41:02,359 –&gt; 00:41:06,759<br>Grab my x, y value, subtract it from others y value, square that,</p>
<p>670<br>00:41:06,759 –&gt; 00:41:09,279<br>and then the rest is just Pythagoras.</p>
<p>671<br>00:41:09,279 –&gt; 00:41:11,199<br>Add those two and take the square root.</p>
<p>672<br>00:41:11,199 –&gt; 00:41:14,199<br>I take it to the power of a half.</p>
<p>673<br>00:41:14,199 –&gt; 00:41:16,599<br>And this function is just a regular function</p>
<p>674<br>00:41:16,599 –&gt; 00:41:20,039<br>other than this self being the first parameter</p>
<p>675<br>00:41:20,039 –&gt; 00:41:23,399<br>and us working with data attributes of myself</p>
<p>676<br>00:41:23,399 –&gt; 00:41:26,359<br>and potentially other parameters.</p>
<p>677<br>00:41:26,359 –&gt; 00:41:28,599<br>But you can see it returns a value.</p>
<p>678<br>00:41:28,599 –&gt; 00:41:33,239<br>It has the d, f, a name, and things like that.</p>
<p>679<br>00:41:33,239 –&gt; 00:41:35,119<br>So the way we’re going to use this method</p>
<p>680<br>00:41:35,119 –&gt; 00:41:37,119<br>that we just wrote is using the dot operator.</p>
<p>681<br>00:41:37,119 –&gt; 00:41:41,799<br>Just like we accessed a data attribute of an object</p>
<p>682<br>00:41:41,799 –&gt; 00:41:44,039<br>that I created, I can access</p>
<p>683<br>00:41:44,039 –&gt; 00:41:48,840<br>a procedural attribute, i.e. a method of an object I just created.</p>
<p>684<br>00:41:48,840 –&gt; 00:41:51,440<br>So we use the dot operator for this.</p>
<p>685<br>00:41:51,440 –&gt; 00:41:53,920<br>The thing before the dot is the object</p>
<p>686<br>00:41:53,920 –&gt; 00:41:58,360<br>I would like to call the method on, dot,</p>
<p>687<br>00:41:58,360 –&gt; 00:42:00,759<br>the name of the method I’d like to call.</p>
<p>688<br>00:42:00,759 –&gt; 00:42:03,000<br>And in parentheses, it’s just a function.</p>
<p>689<br>00:42:03,000 –&gt; 00:42:06,920<br>So I need to give it any parameters this method expects.</p>
<p>690<br>00:42:06,920 –&gt; 00:42:08,840<br>Now this should look very familiar.</p>
<p>691<br>00:42:08,840 –&gt; 00:42:12,239<br>We introduced dot notation when we worked with lists, right?</p>
<p>692<br>00:42:12,239 –&gt; 00:42:14,279<br>Remember that?</p>
<p>693<br>00:42:14,279 –&gt; 00:42:16,919<br>And I said when we worked with a list, right?</p>
<p>694<br>00:42:16,919 –&gt; 00:42:19,119<br>For now, have to remember why we used</p>
<p>695<br>00:42:19,119 –&gt; 00:42:22,119<br>this special way of writing this function.</p>
<p>696<br>00:42:22,119 –&gt; 00:42:23,519<br>But it was the same idea.</p>
<p>697<br>00:42:23,519 –&gt; 00:42:26,039<br>The thing before the dot was the list I wanted</p>
<p>698<br>00:42:26,039 –&gt; 00:42:28,159<br>to apply the function to.</p>
<p>699<br>00:42:28,159 –&gt; 00:42:31,279<br>So my list is the name of a list variable.</p>
<p>700<br>00:42:31,279 –&gt; 00:42:33,319<br>I wanted to apply the function append,</p>
<p>701<br>00:42:33,319 –&gt; 00:42:37,319<br>and it happened to take an integer as a parameter.</p>
<p>702<br>00:42:37,319 –&gt; 00:42:39,759<br>And same with sort here is also another one.</p>
<p>703<br>00:42:39,759 –&gt; 00:42:41,359<br>But this one didn’t take any parameters.</p>
<p>704<br>00:42:41,360 –&gt; 00:42:44,200<br>But it’s the same idea of the dot notation.</p>
<p>705<br>00:42:44,200 –&gt; 00:42:47,160<br>So in terms of our class, here I’ve</p>
<p>706<br>00:42:47,160 –&gt; 00:42:49,840<br>got two coordinate objects, right?</p>
<p>707<br>00:42:49,840 –&gt; 00:42:53,120<br>And I’ve got a dot notation being used here</p>
<p>708<br>00:42:53,120 –&gt; 00:42:56,920<br>to find the distance between one object and another one.</p>
<p>709<br>00:42:56,920 –&gt; 00:42:58,840<br>So the thing before the dot is an object</p>
<p>710<br>00:42:58,840 –&gt; 00:43:01,440<br>I would like to use the distance method on.</p>
<p>711<br>00:43:01,440 –&gt; 00:43:04,920<br>Pick one of them, c, dot distance, the name of the method</p>
<p>712<br>00:43:04,920 –&gt; 00:43:06,519<br>I’d like to call.</p>
<p>713<br>00:43:06,519 –&gt; 00:43:10,480<br>And in parentheses, I’ve got another coordinate object,</p>
<p>714<br>00:43:10,480 –&gt; 00:43:11,559<br>or rig.</p>
<p>715<br>00:43:11,559 –&gt; 00:43:17,559<br>So here, I am using the class, right?</p>
<p>716<br>00:43:17,559 –&gt; 00:43:19,440<br>And I’ve got actual values, right?</p>
<p>717<br>00:43:19,440 –&gt; 00:43:22,000<br>Actual objects that I’m manipulating, right?</p>
<p>718<br>00:43:22,000 –&gt; 00:43:23,320<br>C and or rig.</p>
<p>719<br>00:43:27,360 –&gt; 00:43:29,840<br>So this might look a little bit weird,</p>
<p>720<br>00:43:29,840 –&gt; 00:43:31,920<br>but when we actually call the function remember,</p>
<p>721<br>00:43:31,920 –&gt; 00:43:35,360<br>we omitted self when we omitted, sorry,</p>
<p>722<br>00:43:35,360 –&gt; 00:43:38,000<br>we omitted self when we made this function call.</p>
<p>723<br>00:43:38,000 –&gt; 00:43:40,000<br>But that’s because self implicitly</p>
<p>724<br>00:43:40,000 –&gt; 00:43:42,639<br>becomes the thing before the dot.</p>
<p>725<br>00:43:42,639 –&gt; 00:43:46,360<br>The thing you’re calling this method on.</p>
<p>726<br>00:43:46,360 –&gt; 00:43:48,480<br>So let’s visualize that in our memory.</p>
<p>727<br>00:43:48,480 –&gt; 00:43:50,960<br>So here I’ve got my class definition for a coordinate.</p>
<p>728<br>00:43:50,960 –&gt; 00:43:54,719<br>It has some data attributes and some procedural attributes.</p>
<p>729<br>00:43:54,719 –&gt; 00:43:58,360<br>I’ve got these two objects being created.</p>
<p>730<br>00:43:58,360 –&gt; 00:44:00,400<br>C is this object of type coordinate,</p>
<p>731<br>00:44:00,400 –&gt; 00:44:02,079<br>or rig is this object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>732<br>00:44:02,079 –&gt; 00:44:03,679<br>They’ve got different x and y values,</p>
<p>733<br>00:44:03,679 –&gt; 00:44:07,960<br>but they both have x and y, some x and y values.</p>
<p>734<br>00:44:07,960 –&gt; 00:44:16,679<br>When I make a function call to a method call on c, Python says,</p>
<p>735<br>00:44:16,679 –&gt; 00:44:19,800<br>all right, let me look at this thing before the dot.</p>
<p>736<br>00:44:19,800 –&gt; 00:44:20,360<br>What is it?</p>
<p>737<br>00:44:20,360 –&gt; 00:44:22,199<br>It’s an object of type coordinate.</p>
<p>738<br>00:44:25,199 –&gt; 00:44:28,840<br>Then it looks at the method you’re trying to call distance.</p>
<p>739<br>00:44:28,840 –&gt; 00:44:32,240<br>It says, hey, does coordinate have a distance method defined?</p>
<p>740<br>00:44:32,240 –&gt; 00:44:33,199<br>Why yes, it does?</p>
<p>741<br>00:44:33,199 –&gt; 00:44:35,079<br>We just wrote it.</p>
<p>742<br>00:44:35,079 –&gt; 00:44:36,360<br>And then it says, all right, well,</p>
<p>743<br>00:44:36,360 –&gt; 00:44:38,320<br>let me call this distance method.</p>
<p>744<br>00:44:38,320 –&gt; 00:44:44,640<br>It’s going to set self as c, the thing before the dot.</p>
<p>745<br>00:44:44,640 –&gt; 00:44:47,360<br>And any other parameters will be set in order</p>
<p>746<br>00:44:47,360 –&gt; 00:44:49,200<br>to whatever is being passed in here.</p>
<p>747<br>00:44:49,200 –&gt; 00:44:53,680<br>So or rig will become the other parameter</p>
<p>748<br>00:44:53,680 –&gt; 00:44:55,240<br>from my definition for that function.</p>
<p>749<br>00:44:59,599 –&gt; 00:45:04,039<br>So this is just the conventional way of calling methods.</p>
<p>750<br>00:45:04,039 –&gt; 00:45:05,960<br>And it’s the way we’ve been working with lists</p>
<p>751<br>00:45:05,960 –&gt; 00:45:08,119<br>and dictionaries and things like that.</p>
<p>752<br>00:45:08,119 –&gt; 00:45:14,079<br>So again, we’ve got some object, the thing before the dot, some method to run.</p>
<p>753<br>00:45:16,760 –&gt; 00:45:20,400<br>And when we call it this way, the thing before the dot becomes self</p>
<p>754<br>00:45:20,400 –&gt; 00:45:23,880<br>in our class definition, right, in our method definition.</p>
<p>755<br>00:45:23,880 –&gt; 00:45:28,440<br>And then all the other parameters become assigned one by one, right,</p>
<p>756<br>00:45:28,440 –&gt; 00:45:30,639<br>everything except for self.</p>
<p>757<br>00:45:30,639 –&gt; 00:45:34,760<br>Now to sort of demystify this, I would like to show you what this is actually</p>
<p>758<br>00:45:34,760 –&gt; 00:45:36,080<br>equivalent to.</p>
<p>759<br>00:45:36,080 –&gt; 00:45:38,800<br>So we can run the function, the method that we defined,</p>
<p>760<br>00:45:38,800 –&gt; 00:45:43,760<br>using by actually passing in a value for self, right, if this is more,</p>
<p>761<br>00:45:43,760 –&gt; 00:45:46,080<br>if this is clear to you.</p>
<p>762<br>00:45:46,080 –&gt; 00:45:52,680<br>So in that case, the thing before the dot cannot be an object, right?</p>
<p>763<br>00:45:52,680 –&gt; 00:45:55,160<br>Because if it is an object of the type coordinate,</p>
<p>764<br>00:45:55,160 –&gt; 00:45:59,240<br>then Python will say, well, this is the object I’m running the distance method on.</p>
<p>765<br>00:45:59,240 –&gt; 00:46:04,400<br>So to demystify this, you can actually invoke the name of the class, right?</p>
<p>766<br>00:46:04,400 –&gt; 00:46:09,240<br>The object that you’re trying to create the name, the data type, right, coordinate.</p>
<p>767<br>00:46:09,240 –&gt; 00:46:12,840<br>And then Python says, oh, I see, you’re calling the name of the class.</p>
<p>768<br>00:46:14,840 –&gt; 00:46:18,320<br>It’s not an object, so then what do you want from me?</p>
<p>769<br>00:46:18,320 –&gt; 00:46:22,880<br>Okay, the thing after the dot says, I would like to run this method on you.</p>
<p>770<br>00:46:22,880 –&gt; 00:46:27,599<br>But now it needs all the parameters in the parameter list, including self.</p>
<p>771<br>00:46:29,079 –&gt; 00:46:33,400<br>So here, I would set, I would have to give it explicitly C,</p>
<p>772<br>00:46:33,400 –&gt; 00:46:38,119<br>but the 0 instead of just 0, because the thing before the dot is the name of my class,</p>
<p>773<br>00:46:38,119 –&gt; 00:46:41,000<br>not an actual object, like it is on the side.</p>
<p>774<br>00:46:41,000 –&gt; 00:46:43,519<br>So this is actually the conventional way to do this, right?</p>
<p>775<br>00:46:43,519 –&gt; 00:46:46,000<br>This is the shorthand, the Python way to do this.</p>
<p>776<br>00:46:46,000 –&gt; 00:46:53,440<br>But this hopefully demystifies the self deal and the way we actually set</p>
<p>777<br>00:46:53,440 –&gt; 00:46:55,599<br>that first parameter to the thing before the dot.</p>
<p>778<br>00:46:57,599 –&gt; 00:46:58,800<br>All right, yes, question.</p>
<p>779<br>00:46:58,800 –&gt; 00:47:02,800<br>If you could first want to add one of the one parameter, you should add 0.</p>
<p>780<br>00:47:02,800 –&gt; 00:47:03,600<br>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>781<br>00:47:03,600 –&gt; 00:47:07,600<br>If there’s more parameter, just pop in those extra ones with commas, just like a regular function.</p>
<p>782<br>00:47:07,600 –&gt; 00:47:13,000<br>All right, so this dot operator basically accesses either our data, C dot X,</p>
<p>783<br>00:47:13,000 –&gt; 00:47:17,800<br>or our methods, right, C dot distance, whatever, or whatever method name we have.</p>
<p>784<br>00:47:17,800 –&gt; 00:47:21,080<br>All right, so that’s it for today’s lecture.</p>
<p>785<br>00:47:21,080 –&gt; 00:47:24,800<br>Next lecture, we’re going to build on this coordinate object by creating circles.</p>
<p>786<br>00:47:24,800 –&gt; 00:47:27,120<br>And then we’ll create some fraction objects.</p>
<p>787<br>00:47:27,120 –&gt; 00:47:32,800<br>And we’ll look at some other way, some other objects that we can bundle together.</p>
<p>788<br>00:47:32,800 –&gt; 00:47:33,800<br>Okay.</p>
