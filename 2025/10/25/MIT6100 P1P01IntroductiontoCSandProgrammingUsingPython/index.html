                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:23,719<br>All right, so welcome to the first lecture of 600L. That’s our new number. My name is</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:23,719 –&gt; 00:00:29,239<br>Anna Bell. That’s two separate names. First name, Anna, last name, Bell, super confusing. But I’ve</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:29,239 –&gt; 00:00:34,359<br>been a lecturer here in the CS department for probably almost 10 years now. And I’ve been doing</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:34,359 –&gt; 00:00:41,239<br>the intro course for a while. I’m really happy to be teaching this full semester version of 600A.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:42,039 –&gt; 00:00:48,599<br>So today, what we’re going to do is go over a little bit of course administrative information. And</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:48,600 –&gt; 00:00:53,960<br>then we’ll dive right into just some thoughts about computers, high level, how they work, and then we’ll</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:53,960 –&gt; 00:01:00,760<br>start going into some Python basics. So we’re going to get coding right away. So I highly encourage you,</p>
<p>8<br>00:01:00,760 –&gt; 00:01:07,240<br>since you’re in this class, to download the lecture slides beforehand, to take notes and run code when</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:07,240 –&gt; 00:01:13,799<br>I do. Some of the lectures are interactive, so and we’ll have breaks. So there’ll be a place where you</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:13,799 –&gt; 00:01:19,479<br>can take a break to actually do some coding. And that’s important. I call them you try breaks. That’s</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:19,479 –&gt; 00:01:23,879<br>important to make sure that you’re actually practicing what we are learning right at this time.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:24,759 –&gt; 00:01:29,879<br>The main idea for lectures is yes, I will do some teaching, but there will also be opportunities for</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:29,879 –&gt; 00:01:36,120<br>questions and for you guys to try some programming right on the spot. Even if you don’t finish writing</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:36,120 –&gt; 00:01:41,239<br>a program that we start talking about, I will finish it and we can all kind of talk about it together</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:41,239 –&gt; 00:01:47,719<br>and I’ll kind of show you some pitfalls and things like that. There will be lots of opportunities to</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:47,719 –&gt; 00:01:53,399<br>practice in this class through at various degrees of granularity. And then there’s also lots of</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:53,399 –&gt; 00:01:59,239<br>opportunities that I have in the handouts to do extra practice at home and through a bunch of</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:59,239 –&gt; 00:02:07,159<br>different resources as well. The reason why I stress participation and practice is because part of</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:07,159 –&gt; 00:02:12,039<br>the reason you’re here is you want to learn how to program right. You don’t know how to program yet.</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:12,039 –&gt; 00:02:17,319<br>And programming is actually a skill right. It’s like math or reading. It’s something that you have to</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:17,319 –&gt; 00:02:22,680<br>practice. You can’t just watch me type in a bunch of lines of code and then when it comes time for</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:22,680 –&gt; 00:02:29,400<br>to do the quiz you automatically know how to do it. You need to do it often more and more so that it</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:29,400 –&gt; 00:02:35,560<br>becomes sort of second nature right. So the three big things you’ll get out of this class are</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:35,560 –&gt; 00:02:40,599<br>knowledge of concepts. Obviously we’re going to learn some computer science ideas programming skill</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:41,319 –&gt; 00:02:48,520<br>and problem solving. Problem solving skills. Lectures and exams basically help you with your</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:48,520 –&gt; 00:02:53,879<br>knowledge of test your knowledge of concepts and help you get knowledge of concepts. Finger exercises</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:53,879 –&gt; 00:03:00,599<br>get give you the programming skills and the problem sets help you with problem solving. Basically</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:00,599 –&gt; 00:03:07,960<br>if you’re given an English version of a problem in English how do you go from that to thinking</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:07,960 –&gt; 00:03:13,799<br>about what computer science concepts can I apply and then after that how do I take those computer</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:13,799 –&gt; 00:03:21,879<br>science concepts and actually do the programming. So what are some topics we’ll be covering? We will be</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:21,879 –&gt; 00:03:28,120<br>at the core of it learning computational thinking. So in the future when you encounter a problem you can</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:28,840 –&gt; 00:03:34,039<br>your first thought shouldn’t be how do I kind of mathematically solve this or how do I brute force</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:34,039 –&gt; 00:03:39,879<br>manually solve this problem. How can I apply computation to help me solve this problem and throughout</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:39,879 –&gt; 00:03:44,920<br>these lectures you’re going to see some examples of us applying computation to a problem you might</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:44,920 –&gt; 00:03:52,360<br>have already seen and maybe solved mathematically which is pretty cool. Obviously to get to that</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:52,360 –&gt; 00:03:56,599<br>we’re going to learn the Python programming language once we get the basics we’re going to see how</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:56,599 –&gt; 00:04:02,039<br>we can start to structure our code to look a little bit better so we don’t just have a bunch of</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:02,039 –&gt; 00:04:08,680<br>code dumped on in a file. We’re going to start to organize our code and see how we can make a neat</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:08,680 –&gt; 00:04:17,319<br>readable and modular and then towards the not in this lecture but in a couple lectures and as a</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:17,319 –&gt; 00:04:22,680<br>theme throughout this this class we’re going to look at some algorithms they’re not super complicated</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:22,680 –&gt; 00:04:27,879<br>but they’re kind of the base algorithms for a bunch of algorithms you might see in the future if</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:27,879 –&gt; 00:04:33,160<br>you decide to take more CS classes. Lastly towards the end of the class we’re going to see algorithmic</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:33,160 –&gt; 00:04:38,040<br>complexity which basically means we’re going to start asking or trying to answer the question</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:38,759 –&gt; 00:04:43,639<br>how do we know the programs we write are efficient right we can write programs but how do we know</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:43,639 –&gt; 00:04:48,439<br>that they’re fast and how do we know that they don’t you know take up all the memory in the computer</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:48,439 –&gt; 00:04:54,279<br>so things like that comparing different algorithms that do the same thing against each other.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:55,719 –&gt; 00:05:01,319<br>So if there’s no questions again as I said a bunch of this information is already in the handout</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:01,319 –&gt; 00:05:12,920<br>plus more we can begin. Okay so let’s start by talking about knowledge. Declarative knowledge is</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:12,920 –&gt; 00:05:18,600<br>a statement of fact and a lot of us probably in math and in the past have worked with declarative</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:18,600 –&gt; 00:05:24,520<br>knowledge but this is not how computer science is not how this class works. In computer science what</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:24,520 –&gt; 00:05:31,240<br>we do is we work with imperative knowledge which is basically a recipe how to do something and when</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:31,240 –&gt; 00:05:36,439<br>we’re programming all we’re doing is writing a recipe for the computer to do something that’s it.</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:36,439 –&gt; 00:05:44,839<br>So here’s a numerical example the first statement is a declarative statement right the square root</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:44,839 –&gt; 00:05:50,279<br>of a number x is y such that y times y is equal to x there are many possible values for x and y that</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:50,279 –&gt; 00:05:56,439<br>this statement can be true right but if we gave that statement to a computer it wouldn’t know what</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:56,439 –&gt; 00:06:03,560<br>to do with it what we need to do is tell the computer how to find the square root of a number and</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:03,560 –&gt; 00:06:07,879<br>then tell us what the square root of that number is and so the computer that needs a recipe.</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:09,399 –&gt; 00:06:14,600<br>So the recipe a really simple one for finding the square root of a number is steps 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:15,560 –&gt; 00:06:22,439<br>So what we do is let’s say we want to find the square root of 16 we obviously know it’s 4</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:22,439 –&gt; 00:06:26,759<br>but the computer doesn’t and so we give it an initial guess let’s say the guess is 3.</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:27,719 –&gt; 00:06:36,039<br>How do we go from there? So the steps we follow step 1 if 3 times 3, 9 is close enough to 16 we</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:36,039 –&gt; 00:06:44,680<br>can stop it’s not really close enough for me so let’s keep going step 2 otherwise so we’re going</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:44,680 –&gt; 00:06:51,800<br>to make a new guess by averaging g which is our original guess 3 and x over g which is 16 over</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:51,800 –&gt; 00:06:59,800<br>3 right 16 was the square we wanted to find so our next guess is 4.17 okay using the new guess</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:59,800 –&gt; 00:07:04,840<br>repeat the process until we are close enough so we go back to step 1 that’s the first part of</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:04,840 –&gt; 00:07:12,120<br>the process we find guess squared 4.17 squared is 17.36 so now we say is that close enough?</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:13,560 –&gt; 00:07:20,360<br>Not really it’s not it’s 17 it’s not really even close 16 so let’s do it again we make a new</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:20,360 –&gt; 00:07:31,080<br>guess by averaging 4.17 and 16 divided by 4.17 right that gives us our new guess 4.305 okay next</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:31,080 –&gt; 00:07:39,240<br>step right using the new guess we repeat the process so 4.305 squared is 16.277 0.277</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:40,040 –&gt; 00:07:46,439<br>is that close enough to x? Yeah I could be happy with this I could stop there because we’re within</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:46,439 –&gt; 00:07:52,040<br>sort of plus minus 1 so I’m okay with that but if we wanted to be within plus or minus 1 times</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:52,040 –&gt; 00:07:57,000<br>10 to the negative like 6 or 7 or something like that then we would continue the process</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:58,759 –&gt; 00:08:04,839<br>so really what we had there is an algorithm right it’s a sequence of steps step 1 step 2 step 3</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:04,839 –&gt; 00:08:10,279<br>there’s some sort of flow of control right we had a place where we said if this is you know</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:10,279 –&gt; 00:08:16,040<br>if the guess is close enough then you know we can stop otherwise we do something else we had</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:16,040 –&gt; 00:08:20,520<br>another flow of control where we said repeat this thing right so we’re kind of not going</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:20,520 –&gt; 00:08:26,200<br>linearly but we’re changing the flow and then lastly is a way to stop right we don’t want the</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:26,200 –&gt; 00:08:31,320<br>algorithm to go on forever we would like to stop at some point and the stopping point I was kind</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:31,320 –&gt; 00:08:37,960<br>of vague about it but it could be you know when we were within plus or minus 1 of the actual answer</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:38,600 –&gt; 00:08:47,480<br>and so right recipes are basically algorithms right my grandmother was basically teaching algorithms</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:47,480 –&gt; 00:08:54,519<br>when she would teach me to like to bake a cake right she didn’t call it that but she was really</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:55,480 –&gt; 00:09:00,680<br>and so even recipes have that same structure there’s a sequence of steps there’s a flow of control</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:00,680 –&gt; 00:09:06,600<br>like if you don’t have a user substitute or repeat this you know repeat sticking a toothpick to see</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:06,600 –&gt; 00:09:12,200<br>if it comes out clean every minute or something like that and then there’s a mean a way to stop right</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:12,200 –&gt; 00:09:17,639<br>when the toothpick comes out clean you take it out of the oven and you eat it and so computers are</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:17,639 –&gt; 00:09:24,200<br>machines that execute these algorithms they’re actually dumb right computers are not very smart they</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:24,200 –&gt; 00:09:29,639<br>don’t make decisions on their own they just follow these sequences of steps that we told them to do</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:30,519 –&gt; 00:09:36,200<br>computers are good at storing lots and lots of data right we can’t really do that but</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:36,200 –&gt; 00:09:42,360<br>the computers can store gigabytes of storage terabytes even and computers can do operations really</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:42,360 –&gt; 00:09:47,080<br>really quickly which is something we can’t do right they’re good at those two things but they’re not</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:47,080 –&gt; 00:09:56,360<br>very smart they can’t make decisions unless they’re told to make the decisions so really the computer</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:56,360 –&gt; 00:10:01,960<br>only does what you tell it to do and that’s one of the big ideas that I want you to come away</p>
<p>93<br>00:10:02,920 –&gt; 00:10:07,960<br>from this from this lecture with computer only does what you tell it to do right the sequences</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:07,960 –&gt; 00:10:14,120<br>of steps that you tell it to do that’s the only thing it follows so a little brief history just to</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:14,120 –&gt; 00:10:19,639<br>kind of make you appreciate programming Python programming language before we actually get started</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:19,639 –&gt; 00:10:27,639<br>with it is so before the 1940s we had these things called fixed program computers okay like a pocket</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:27,639 –&gt; 00:10:34,120<br>calculator is an example of that every button was an operation you could you know in the</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:34,120 –&gt; 00:10:38,439<br>little screen you could use parentheses to put a bunch of different operations together but there</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:38,439 –&gt; 00:10:44,439<br>was no way to sort of store all these operations together to to you know later put in different</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:44,439 –&gt; 00:10:49,159<br>inputs for that same sequence of operations you had to input it every single input those sequences</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:49,159 –&gt; 00:10:57,240<br>of operations every single time after the 1940s stored programs computer computers came into play</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:58,120 –&gt; 00:11:08,120<br>and they were able to store instructions to do things as data okay and there was a special program</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:08,120 –&gt; 00:11:14,519<br>called an interpreter that executed these instructions it knew how to follow simple sequences of steps</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:14,519 –&gt; 00:11:20,919<br>when the program told it to go to a different location it did so it was it was basically executing</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:20,919 –&gt; 00:11:28,919<br>these instructions and the instructions that it it did were arithmetic and logical so</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:28,919 –&gt; 00:11:34,279<br>addition subtraction things like that simple tests like checking for equality between two values</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:34,279 –&gt; 00:11:39,879<br>and moving data so taking this value and putting it at a different memory location so I just</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:39,879 –&gt; 00:11:45,000<br>wanted to give you a really brief overview and this is not super accurate but it gives you a sense of</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:45,000 –&gt; 00:11:52,759<br>how exactly things happen low level in in the computer so the computer basically has memory where</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:52,759 –&gt; 00:11:58,759<br>things are stored it has an arithmetic logic unit that does operations it knows how to add things</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:58,759 –&gt; 00:12:04,440<br>subtract things multiply things compare things and then it has the control unit where this program</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:04,440 –&gt; 00:12:11,639<br>counter is is set and this is where you put a program it so this works this is a program</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:12,519 –&gt; 00:12:19,159<br>and up here is our memory so we have a bunch of memory locations 3 4 5 6 3 4 5 7 and at each of</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:19,159 –&gt; 00:12:25,879<br>these memory locations we have some values stored pre you know pre-filled so when we first run</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:25,879 –&gt; 00:12:32,120<br>this program what ends up happening is the um the interpreter sees the first instruction add the</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:32,120 –&gt; 00:12:39,080<br>values at 3 4 5 6 and 3 4 5 7 together so it goes to these memory locations here grabs the 3 and the</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:39,080 –&gt; 00:12:46,280<br>4 and sends them to the arithmetic logic unit the ALU knows how to do the addition so it adds 3 plus 4</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:46,280 –&gt; 00:12:53,160<br>7 and sends the result back here now we never told it to store that result anywhere but the next</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:53,160 –&gt; 00:12:59,879<br>instruction says store the value you just got back from the ALU at this memory location 3 4 5 8</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:59,879 –&gt; 00:13:06,840<br>so the next step basically takes that 3 4 that 7 and stores it at memory location 3 4 5 8</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:06,840 –&gt; 00:13:17,639<br>super tedious all we did was add 3 plus 4 we do that again we add 7 the values at 7 8 8 9 and 7 8 9</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:17,639 –&gt; 00:13:25,800<br>now so it goes in the memory it grabs the 5 and the 2 sends it to the ALU the ALU calculates it as 7</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:25,800 –&gt; 00:13:33,480<br>brings it back and then we store that in location 7 8 9 1 okay and then after that all we’ve done</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:33,480 –&gt; 00:13:41,800<br>is 2 additions and then the next instruction says compare the values at memory locations 3 4 5 8 and 7 8 9 1</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:41,800 –&gt; 00:13:50,120<br>so we’re going to compare the 7 with the 7 the ALU again does this comparison and says all right well 7</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:50,120 –&gt; 00:13:55,800<br>and 7 are equivalent so this is you know true or whatever it wants to give give back to the um to</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:55,800 –&gt; 00:14:01,800<br>the interpreter and then the last instruction here we have is print the result of that comparison so</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:01,799 –&gt; 00:14:07,319<br>we print true because they were equal right again super high level but it kind of gives you an</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:07,319 –&gt; 00:14:13,479<br>appreciation for programming languages these days right this is very tedious to write if we had to</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:13,479 –&gt; 00:14:19,079<br>write programs in in this manner um Alan Turing a long time ago showed that you can compute anything</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:19,079 –&gt; 00:14:24,519<br>with actually a very an even more basic set of primitives not addition subtraction but instead</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:24,519 –&gt; 00:14:30,279<br>with a tape you would actually have six primitives move the tape left move the tape right read the</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:30,279 –&gt; 00:14:36,199<br>value at the tape put a value on the tape um erase the value from the tape and no operation</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:38,120 –&gt; 00:14:44,679<br>and so since he showed this what the result of it actually was um is down here</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:46,759 –&gt; 00:14:51,559<br>anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language so if we had some</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:51,559 –&gt; 00:14:57,959<br>you know some program written in Java that basically boils down to right something super long</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:58,040 –&gt; 00:15:04,519<br>but something that is made up of these six primitives that means that if we boil down this program</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:04,519 –&gt; 00:15:09,879<br>to these six primitives we can build back up the same program in a completely different language</p>
<p>139<br>00:15:10,440 –&gt; 00:15:16,519<br>and that’s really powerful that’s a really cool statement now we’re not going to be working with</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:16,519 –&gt; 00:15:23,160<br>those primitives um we’re going to be using the Python primitives which are more convenient</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:23,159 –&gt; 00:15:28,439<br>and they allow us to do a lot more things in much less time i’m going to do a look comparison as we</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:28,439 –&gt; 00:15:34,679<br>talk about the primitives of Python with English so in English some of the primitives might be</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:35,719 –&gt; 00:15:41,879<br>words or even we can do letters or characters but you know we can say we can say its words um you know</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:41,879 –&gt; 00:15:45,879<br>with characters we can build up words with words we can build up sentences with sentences we can</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:45,879 –&gt; 00:15:51,319<br>build up stories with stories we can build up books and things like that in programming in programming</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:51,320 –&gt; 00:16:00,680<br>languages the primitives are numbers sequences of characters operators like addition multiplication</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:00,680 –&gt; 00:16:09,640<br>division checking free quality checking that something is greater than things like that so once we</p>
<p>148<br>00:16:09,640 –&gt; 00:16:16,200<br>have these primitives in a language we can start to build up the syntax of the language so in</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:16,200 –&gt; 00:16:22,920<br>English having something like noun and noun and noun doesn’t make any sense right cat dog boy</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:22,920 –&gt; 00:16:30,120<br>doesn’t make much sense it’s not syntactically valid but noun verb noun is syntactically valid right</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:31,160 –&gt; 00:16:38,920<br>similarly in programming languages we can have two objects kind of side by side so here this is a</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:38,920 –&gt; 00:16:44,360<br>sequence of characters h and i and this is the number five right beside that sequence of characters</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:45,320 –&gt; 00:16:49,720<br>but that doesn’t make any sense right what does it mean to have this sequence of characters in that</p>
<p>154<br>00:16:49,720 –&gt; 00:16:55,240<br>number right beside it it has no meaning in Python instead what we have to do is we have to add</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:55,240 –&gt; 00:17:00,200<br>an operator in between these two objects so here we add a little star operator in between the</p>
<p>156<br>00:17:00,200 –&gt; 00:17:05,960<br>sequence of characters high and the number five and in Python the meaning to this is I want to</p>
<p>157<br>00:17:05,960 –&gt; 00:17:11,880<br>repeat the sequence of characters high h i five times so this would basically give me high high high high</p>
<p>158<br>00:17:11,880 –&gt; 00:17:21,240<br>so once we have sentences in English right and and expressions that are syntactically valid we can</p>
<p>159<br>00:17:21,240 –&gt; 00:17:27,080<br>now talk about the static semantics of the language so in English saying something like I are hungry</p>
<p>160<br>00:17:27,080 –&gt; 00:17:35,960<br>is syntactically correct but it’s not syntact static it’s not sorry it’s not it doesn’t have a good</p>
<p>161<br>00:17:35,960 –&gt; 00:17:42,840<br>static semantics right there’s no meaning there’s no meaning to that because the r is for you</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:42,840 –&gt; 00:17:48,600<br>know you are plural similarly in programming languages and this will differ depending on what</p>
<p>163<br>00:17:48,600 –&gt; 00:17:54,120<br>programming language you use here you know in the previous slide we saw that you can use the star</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:54,120 –&gt; 00:18:00,120<br>operator between the the the sequence of characters in the number and that meant repeat that that</p>
<p>165<br>00:18:00,119 –&gt; 00:18:06,039<br>sequence many times but if we use a plus operator in between the sequence of characters and a number</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:06,679 –&gt; 00:18:13,159<br>that doesn’t have any meaning in Python so it has a static semantic error even though it’s</p>
<p>167<br>00:18:13,159 –&gt; 00:18:22,919<br>syntactically valid right we have operator sorry object operator object so so far we’ve been able</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:22,919 –&gt; 00:18:28,039<br>to find really nice parallels with English right and the English language in the programming</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:28,039 –&gt; 00:18:32,440<br>languages but this is kind of where things break down when we talk about the semantics of a</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:32,440 –&gt; 00:18:39,000<br>language so in English you can have many different meanings right the chicken is ready to eat means</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:39,879 –&gt; 00:18:45,240<br>let’s eat this chicken or the chicken is ready to eat means the chicken wants to eat something</p>
<p>172<br>00:18:45,240 –&gt; 00:18:51,720<br>right programming languages there is no multiple meanings to a program that you write because the</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:52,039 –&gt; 00:18:58,360<br>because the computer the machine the language follows the set of instructions to a T there is</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:58,360 –&gt; 00:19:04,360<br>no ambiguity about what it needs to do right it just follows the instructions and does what it needs</p>
<p>175<br>00:19:04,360 –&gt; 00:19:11,720<br>to do to the end till it reaches you know the it terminates the program and so programs only have one</p>
<p>176<br>00:19:11,720 –&gt; 00:19:15,400<br>meaning but the problem is it might not be the meaning that you intended it to have</p>
<p>177<br>00:19:15,400 –&gt; 00:19:23,800<br>and that’s when things start to go wrong we can have syntactic errors in our program spelling errors</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:23,800 –&gt; 00:19:28,680<br>and indentation errors things like that and those are easy to catch static semantic errors are</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:29,320 –&gt; 00:19:37,160<br>90% probably easy to catch but the problem comes in with the semantics right the meaning that you</p>
<p>180<br>00:19:37,160 –&gt; 00:19:44,040<br>intended this program to have might not be what it’s actually doing and that’s where most of my errors</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:44,039 –&gt; 00:19:48,359<br>happen and that’s where I get super frustrated when I program and that’s probably where you guys</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:48,359 –&gt; 00:19:53,240<br>will get super frustrated too because you write a program that you think is doing one thing but</p>
<p>183<br>00:19:53,240 –&gt; 00:19:59,480<br>instead either it crashes eat right away or runs forever and doesn’t really stop or it terminates</p>
<p>184<br>00:19:59,480 –&gt; 00:20:04,440<br>but it gives you an incorrect answer it’s not what you were expecting and we’ll talk about this</p>
<p>185<br>00:20:05,720 –&gt; 00:20:11,879<br>in a few lectures so when we write programs we’re basically writing sequences of definitions</p>
<p>186<br>00:20:12,520 –&gt; 00:20:19,160<br>and commands and we’re going to write these either in a file editor or in a shell the first</p>
<p>187<br>00:20:19,720 –&gt; 00:20:25,160<br>today at least we’re writing in the shell directly and half of tomorrow we’ll write in the shell</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:26,520 –&gt; 00:20:34,440<br>because we’re not really writing any we’re not really writing many lines of code we’re just going</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:34,440 –&gt; 00:20:41,000<br>to be I’m just going to be showing you some really quick quick things that we can do with the Python</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:41,000 –&gt; 00:20:48,279<br>programming language so hopefully you all have installed the programming environment this is the</p>
<p>191<br>00:20:48,279 –&gt; 00:20:53,960<br>code editor so tomorrow we’ll start working in here but for today we’re really just going to work</p>
<p>192<br>00:20:53,960 –&gt; 00:20:59,720<br>on in the shell and even in the future you can still type commands in the shell I find the shell</p>
<p>193<br>00:20:59,720 –&gt; 00:21:04,599<br>very useful if there’s just something really quick that I want to check that I don’t want to write</p>
<p>194<br>00:21:04,599 –&gt; 00:21:08,759<br>you know write a program for and then run it’s just like a simple command that I want to check to</p>
<p>195<br>00:21:08,759 –&gt; 00:21:15,799<br>make sure it’s doing what I think it’s doing before I insert it in my code editor so here we have</p>
<p>196<br>00:21:17,879 –&gt; 00:21:24,200<br>this right so mine is I guess I’m using the white thing just because I find it easier for you guys to</p>
<p>197<br>00:21:24,200 –&gt; 00:21:31,559<br>see this is the file editor and this is just a bunch of expressions are yeah a bunch of code that</p>
<p>198<br>00:21:31,559 –&gt; 00:21:36,519<br>we’re going to type in today and we’re going to type it in the shell today so the thing on the right</p>
<p>199<br>00:21:36,519 –&gt; 00:21:47,720<br>hand side okay so what exactly do we do when we write a program at the base of it we are going to</p>
<p>200<br>00:21:47,720 –&gt; 00:21:54,680<br>create objects inside our programs and we’re going to manipulate them that’s it that’s what</p>
<p>201<br>00:21:54,680 –&gt; 00:22:04,759<br>programming is mostly about at its core now when we create objects it’s important this is kind of</p>
<p>202<br>00:22:04,759 –&gt; 00:22:08,920<br>something we’re going to come back to again and again in a kind of more high level setting but</p>
<p>203<br>00:22:09,720 –&gt; 00:22:15,240<br>right now what I want you to understand is that when we create an object an object has a type</p>
<p>204<br>00:22:16,119 –&gt; 00:22:23,000<br>okay and the type that an object has tells Python the things you’re allowed to do with that object</p>
<p>205<br>00:22:23,960 –&gt; 00:22:31,559<br>so here are two examples the number 30 it’s a number the type we’ll talk about it in a bit the</p>
<p>206<br>00:22:31,559 –&gt; 00:22:36,679<br>type is an integer it’s a whole number but basically what are the things we can do with this integer</p>
<p>207<br>00:22:36,679 –&gt; 00:22:41,559<br>with this number we can add it to another number we can subtract it to another number we can take</p>
<p>208<br>00:22:41,559 –&gt; 00:22:48,440<br>it to another power we can take some other number to this power of 30 right a bunch of sort of</p>
<p>209<br>00:22:48,440 –&gt; 00:22:55,000<br>mathematical operations as you would expect so that’s pretty straightforward what about this one</p>
<p>210<br>00:22:55,400 –&gt; 00:23:03,400<br>this quotation capital A lowercase and lowercase A quotation so this is something we’ll talk about</p>
<p>211<br>00:23:03,400 –&gt; 00:23:09,400<br>next lecture it’s called a string and it’s a sequence of characters the quotations tell Python</p>
<p>212<br>00:23:09,400 –&gt; 00:23:14,359<br>it’s a sequence of characters and the characters part of it are capital A lowercase and lowercase A</p>
<p>213<br>00:23:15,640 –&gt; 00:23:21,160<br>the kinds of things I can do with this string are not the same kinds of things I’m allowed to do</p>
<p>214<br>00:23:21,160 –&gt; 00:23:27,320<br>with a number right if I tried to take Anna and divided by the sequence of characters Bob</p>
<p>215<br>00:23:28,840 –&gt; 00:23:33,640<br>Python would complain very much right because you can’t divide a string by another string a sequence</p>
<p>216<br>00:23:33,640 –&gt; 00:23:38,920<br>of characters doesn’t make sense to divide it by another sequence of characters similarly I can’t</p>
<p>217<br>00:23:38,920 –&gt; 00:23:44,759<br>take Anna to some power right I can’t multiply or I can’t multiply by itself things like that</p>
<p>218<br>00:23:45,480 –&gt; 00:23:49,560<br>but the kinds of things that I am allowed to do on a sequence of characters is different than the</p>
<p>219<br>00:23:49,559 –&gt; 00:23:53,720<br>kinds of things I’m allowed to do on a number so the things I can do with the sequence of characters</p>
<p>220<br>00:23:53,720 –&gt; 00:24:00,200<br>is I can say well what’s the character at the first position what’s the middle character how</p>
<p>221<br>00:24:00,200 –&gt; 00:24:05,879<br>long is the sequence of characters right how many characters do I have and so now you can see that</p>
<p>222<br>00:24:05,879 –&gt; 00:24:11,399<br>the the type of the object is actually really important Python uses it to to know the kinds of</p>
<p>223<br>00:24:11,399 –&gt; 00:24:16,839<br>operations you’re allowed to do with it and so there’s actually scalar objects and these are</p>
<p>224<br>00:24:16,839 –&gt; 00:24:23,959<br>Python’s primitives numbers and truth values and there are non-scalar objects we’re not talking</p>
<p>225<br>00:24:23,959 –&gt; 00:24:28,679<br>about these yet we’ll talk about these in a few lectures but these have some sort of structure so</p>
<p>226<br>00:24:28,679 –&gt; 00:24:34,359<br>for example a list of numbers has a structure because there’s a number at the beginning of the</p>
<p>227<br>00:24:34,359 –&gt; 00:24:38,839<br>list there’s a number at the end of the list things like that but a number itself doesn’t have a</p>
<p>228<br>00:24:38,839 –&gt; 00:24:45,559<br>structure it’s just the number so what are the types of the scalar objects what are the types of</p>
<p>229<br>00:24:45,559 –&gt; 00:24:54,440<br>the primitives in Python integers so number five zero negative a hundred a million float is another</p>
<p>230<br>00:24:54,440 –&gt; 00:25:00,440<br>type it represents all the real numbers so three you know three point two seven two point zero is a</p>
<p>231<br>00:25:00,440 –&gt; 00:25:05,879<br>float because it has a decimal number even though to us that just means two but to Python if you</p>
<p>232<br>00:25:05,879 –&gt; 00:25:11,319<br>put in two point zero it says that’s a type float negative three point one four one five nine things</p>
<p>233<br>00:25:11,319 –&gt; 00:25:17,720<br>like that bull is a bullion it represents truth values and there’s only two possible values that</p>
<p>234<br>00:25:17,720 –&gt; 00:25:25,240<br>a bullion type has true and false and it has to be capital T true and capital T sorry capital F false</p>
<p>235<br>00:25:26,679 –&gt; 00:25:35,480<br>and the last one is this non-type type it’s literally called non-type and it has only one special</p>
<p>236<br>00:25:35,480 –&gt; 00:25:41,720<br>value none we’re not going to talk about it for a bit but we will sometime in the future so to</p>
<p>237<br>00:25:41,720 –&gt; 00:25:47,799<br>figure out the type of an object when you create that object you you use the type command so we can</p>
<p>238<br>00:25:47,799 –&gt; 00:25:53,799<br>say something like type parentheses and this is a command and inside the parentheses you say what</p>
<p>239<br>00:25:53,799 –&gt; 00:25:59,880<br>do you want to find the type of so if we do type of seven it tells me it’s an it and if you want to</p>
<p>240<br>00:25:59,880 –&gt; 00:26:04,599<br>do the same command again I hit the up arrow and it automatically puts in what I wrote previously</p>
<p>241<br>00:26:04,599 –&gt; 00:26:09,399<br>and then if I want to do type of 0.0 it’s a float because there’s a decimal point</p>
<p>242<br>00:26:12,919 –&gt; 00:26:20,599<br>so this is basically what I said so we type this in the shell and the shell tells us what the output is</p>
<p>243<br>00:26:23,319 –&gt; 00:26:30,439<br>so just to reiterate int float, bool and non-type are types of objects</p>
<p>244<br>00:26:30,920 –&gt; 00:26:37,799<br>and there can be many different objects you can create of that type right so if you think about</p>
<p>245<br>00:26:37,799 –&gt; 00:26:43,160<br>it in some floats we basically have an infinite number of objects we can create of those types</p>
<p>246<br>00:26:43,720 –&gt; 00:26:49,720<br>right because we can have 0, 1, 2, 3, 100, 200, 300 a million right there’s and all the negatives</p>
<p>247<br>00:26:49,720 –&gt; 00:26:55,640<br>there’s almost a you know infinite number of values uh object that we can create of type</p>
<p>248<br>00:26:55,720 –&gt; 00:27:03,640<br>into float but bool there’s only two the truth values true or false and the non-type there’s only one</p>
<p>249<br>00:27:03,640 –&gt; 00:27:09,080<br>this is not right so that’s the type and these are the possible values possible objects we can create</p>
<p>250<br>00:27:11,240 –&gt; 00:27:16,520<br>you try it so you can just yell out the answers there’s nothing to type unless you want to check</p>
<p>251<br>00:27:16,519 –&gt; 00:27:28,759<br>yourself so what is the type of 1234 int type of 8.99 float type of 9.0 float type of true</p>
<p>252<br>00:27:29,879 –&gt; 00:27:36,359<br>bool and type of false bool perfect if you ever wonder what the type of something is you type it in</p>
<p>253<br>00:27:36,359 –&gt; 00:27:44,440<br>here just you guys are doing well type is bool type of lowercase t true is an error just wanted to</p>
<p>254<br>00:27:44,440 –&gt; 00:27:49,799<br>point that out just to reiterate the fact that capitalization matters in Python this is our first</p>
<p>255<br>00:27:49,799 –&gt; 00:27:58,200<br>error by the way guys very exciting the error is a name error and this is the message associated with</p>
<p>256<br>00:27:58,200 –&gt; 00:28:07,000<br>it you also know that it’s something special in Python when you have color coded stuff so you see</p>
<p>257<br>00:28:07,000 –&gt; 00:28:13,720<br>capital T true capital false are this dark blue here right whereas anything that’s not</p>
<p>258<br>00:28:14,759 –&gt; 00:28:21,000<br>special in Python is just black right so type is a special command right this is a float so you</p>
<p>259<br>00:28:21,000 –&gt; 00:28:29,160<br>see their color coded okay so once we create objects one thing we can do with these objects is to</p>
<p>260<br>00:28:29,160 –&gt; 00:28:37,240<br>cast them to different type now this is a little bit um maybe confusing because we’re not actually</p>
<p>261<br>00:28:37,240 –&gt; 00:28:44,120<br>changing the object once we’ve created it so once we create the integer three it’s</p>
<p>262<br>00:28:44,119 –&gt; 00:28:51,559<br>there in memory if we cast that integer to a float version of it we’re creating a new object</p>
<p>263<br>00:28:51,559 –&gt; 00:28:56,759<br>in memory we’re not changing the three the three already exists we’re just getting the float</p>
<p>264<br>00:28:56,759 –&gt; 00:29:03,719<br>version of it and storing it as a new object in memory so when we do float three this is a command</p>
<p>265<br>00:29:03,719 –&gt; 00:29:11,799<br>that gets for me the float version of the integer three okay so that will give me 3.0 so for example</p>
<p>266<br>00:29:12,680 –&gt; 00:29:26,200<br>um right this is what I had float three right the output is 3.0 if I do int of 5.2 it truncates it</p>
<p>267<br>00:29:26,200 –&gt; 00:29:33,799<br>and it gives me the integer portion of this float if I do int of 5.9 it still truncates it and</p>
<p>268<br>00:29:33,799 –&gt; 00:29:39,000<br>gives me the integer version of this float it doesn’t round right I’m just asking for the integer</p>
<p>269<br>00:29:39,000 –&gt; 00:29:46,119<br>version of this of this of this float some operations like round is an operation we can do</p>
<p>270<br>00:29:47,000 –&gt; 00:29:54,599<br>has an implicit cast in it so if I round 5.9 it’s actually going to round it to 6.0 and then cast</p>
<p>271<br>00:29:54,599 –&gt; 00:30:00,519<br>it to an integer so notice it doesn’t give me as an output 6.0 it then rounds it to just 6</p>
<p>272<br>00:30:00,519 –&gt; 00:30:09,480<br>okay so that’s basically what I said in the example so let’s have you try this</p>
<p>273<br>00:30:10,920 –&gt; 00:30:15,879<br>what are the types of the following I don’t need the values but the types so if I get type</p>
<p>274<br>00:30:16,359 –&gt; 00:30:28,759<br>of float of 123 what is the type of that float yeah exactly yep I’m yep what if I round 7.9</p>
<p>275<br>00:30:28,759 –&gt; 00:30:38,200<br>what’s the type of the result int yep what if I create a float of the round of 7.2 yes good float would</p>
<p>276<br>00:30:38,200 –&gt; 00:30:50,599<br>be 7.0 and the int of 7.2 int yes exactly I want the type not the value and the int of 7.9 is an int</p>
<p>277<br>00:30:50,599 –&gt; 00:30:58,200<br>exactly awesome good okay so we’ve created a bunch of objects right we know that we can create a</p>
<p>278<br>00:30:58,200 –&gt; 00:31:04,680<br>bunch of objects in our programs what do we do with them well we can combine them into expressions</p>
<p>279<br>00:31:05,559 –&gt; 00:31:13,559<br>so let’s say we have 3 plus 2 I’ve got object operator object cool syntactically valid in python</p>
<p>280<br>00:31:13,559 –&gt; 00:31:21,960<br>and has no static semantic error so if I do that in python it’s going to be okay 3 plus 2</p>
<p>281<br>00:31:22,759 –&gt; 00:31:33,400<br>5 and the type of 3 plus 2 is an integer right so basically what I’ve done here I’ve put an</p>
<p>282<br>00:31:33,400 –&gt; 00:31:41,720<br>expression within this type command and that’s okay that’s in fact encouraged in python you don’t</p>
<p>283<br>00:31:41,720 –&gt; 00:31:46,519<br>just want to calculate and then stick in that would be very very tedious so you can insert</p>
<p>284<br>00:31:46,519 –&gt; 00:31:54,039<br>expressions in many many different places right so here we have 3 plus 2 5 divided by 3 again we’ve</p>
<p>285<br>00:31:54,039 –&gt; 00:32:00,039<br>got you know 5 divided by 3 has this decimal value and the result has a float has of type is of type</p>
<p>286<br>00:32:00,039 –&gt; 00:32:07,960<br>float so the important thing to remember when we’re doing expressions is python reads the expression</p>
<p>287<br>00:32:08,599 –&gt; 00:32:15,079<br>but it does not store the expression in memory okay what it does is it reads the expression</p>
<p>288<br>00:32:15,079 –&gt; 00:32:22,599<br>evaluates it to one single value and then it stores the result value in memory so it never</p>
<p>289<br>00:32:22,599 –&gt; 00:32:28,359<br>stores the expression it evaluates the expression and then stores the value okay and so this is</p>
<p>290<br>00:32:28,359 –&gt; 00:32:35,079<br>this syntax for an expression object operator object as we just just saw and that’s really and the</p>
<p>291<br>00:32:35,079 –&gt; 00:32:42,439<br>idea I said before right where python stores values of expressions not the expressions themselves</p>
<p>292<br>00:32:42,519 –&gt; 00:32:49,720<br>is really really important right so this is my first big idea slide I decided to insert these</p>
<p>293<br>00:32:49,720 –&gt; 00:32:54,360<br>because I think they kind of stress the importance of several concepts so I hope this is one</p>
<p>294<br>00:32:55,320 –&gt; 00:33:00,360<br>so you know we’re taking expressions they can be as complex as you’d like we can use parentheses</p>
<p>295<br>00:33:00,360 –&gt; 00:33:06,039<br>you know a bunch of it can doesn’t just have to be operator object operator object it can be more</p>
<p>296<br>00:33:06,039 –&gt; 00:33:13,000<br>complex than that but basically however complex that expression is we evaluate it and we replace</p>
<p>297<br>00:33:13,000 –&gt; 00:33:19,399<br>it with one value and the expression can be something like this it doesn’t just have to be something</p>
<p>298<br>00:33:19,399 –&gt; 00:33:24,839<br>that’s mathematical right this was a mathematical expression but this is also an expression and it</p>
<p>299<br>00:33:24,839 –&gt; 00:33:32,200<br>evaluates so this entire thing evaluates to this word you know this word which represents the type</p>
<p>300<br>00:33:32,200 –&gt; 00:33:41,480<br>integer so here’s some more examples three plus two again we got we’ve got these examples with</p>
<p>301<br>00:33:41,480 –&gt; 00:33:46,840<br>the parentheses four plus two times six minus one obviously gives us the number 35 and then we</p>
<p>302<br>00:33:46,840 –&gt; 00:33:52,759<br>can insert expressions wherever we’d like so here I’m inserting that specific expression in the</p>
<p>303<br>00:33:52,759 –&gt; 00:34:01,799<br>type command and this is also an expression like I just said and its result is int okay and similarly</p>
<p>304<br>00:34:01,799 –&gt; 00:34:08,199<br>we can also insert that expression here and then we can wrap that around cast and it gives us a</p>
<p>305<br>00:34:08,199 –&gt; 00:34:29,480<br>flow yes when you’re inserting when you’re inserting what oh I see</p>
<p>306<br>00:34:30,440 –&gt; 00:34:40,840<br>yeah that’s a good that’s a good question so in this particular case the type and the float are not</p>
<p>307<br>00:34:42,039 –&gt; 00:34:47,320<br>there’s no operator I guess in this particular case it’s more like a command that gives us an</p>
<p>308<br>00:34:47,320 –&gt; 00:34:54,840<br>output but there is still some there is there is still an output that that it gives us so we can</p>
<p>309<br>00:34:54,840 –&gt; 00:35:03,160<br>then take the result of this and save it somewhere else sorry yeah I guess the example I gave on</p>
<p>310<br>00:35:03,160 –&gt; 00:35:08,280<br>the previous slide was just an example of an expression where we could you object operator object</p>
<p>311<br>00:35:15,240 –&gt; 00:35:21,160<br>when we have these I guess it works for mathematical expressions mathematical expressions work left</p>
<p>312<br>00:35:21,159 –&gt; 00:35:32,039<br>to right just like in math parentheses can override certain precedents if we have commands that have</p>
<p>313<br>00:35:32,039 –&gt; 00:35:37,960<br>computations then we have this command with the parentheses and we evaluate what’s inside the</p>
<p>314<br>00:35:37,960 –&gt; 00:35:46,440<br>parentheses first so we work our way in to out in that particular case so here’s some examples</p>
<p>315<br>00:35:46,440 –&gt; 00:35:52,440<br>let’s have you try these so we can type these in our console what are the values of the following</p>
<p>316<br>00:35:52,440 –&gt; 00:36:04,440<br>expressions so 13 minus 4 divided by 12 times 12 so we can try that I don’t know off the top of my</p>
<p>317<br>00:36:04,440 –&gt; 00:36:12,200<br>head so I’ll have to type it in 0.0625 okay so the value of that expression is a float right 0.0625</p>
<p>318<br>00:36:12,199 –&gt; 00:36:15,559<br>what’s the value of the expression type 4 times 3</p>
<p>319<br>00:36:18,519 –&gt; 00:36:27,719<br>in to what about the type of the expression 4.0 times 3 yes exactly that’s very good so type of</p>
<p>320<br>00:36:27,719 –&gt; 00:36:36,919<br>4 times 3 is in to but 4.0 times 3 is a float good and then what about in to of a half or of 1 over 2</p>
<p>321<br>00:36:42,519 –&gt; 00:36:51,799<br>yeah exactly it’s 0 yep because it’s 0.5 and we trunkate to 0 the reason I had this here is because</p>
<p>322<br>00:36:51,799 –&gt; 00:36:58,359<br>it leads nicely into this slide you don’t have to memorize these rules you can always check it out</p>
<p>323<br>00:36:58,359 –&gt; 00:37:04,679<br>in the console but there are some rules for the resulting types when we do operations so when</p>
<p>324<br>00:37:04,679 –&gt; 00:37:13,319<br>we do operations with numbers addition subtraction and multiplication always yield an integer if both</p>
<p>325<br>00:37:13,319 –&gt; 00:37:18,279<br>of the operators are integers if one is a float or both are floats then it gives me a float</p>
<p>326<br>00:37:19,399 –&gt; 00:37:24,440<br>division is different no matter what types you divide you’ll always get a float</p>
<p>327<br>00:37:27,079 –&gt; 00:37:32,279<br>now what about this slash slash and this percent these are actually useful operations</p>
<p>328<br>00:37:32,360 –&gt; 00:37:39,320<br>they kind of go hand in hand with division so when I do 5 divided by 3 it’s this 1.667</p>
<p>329<br>00:37:41,720 –&gt; 00:37:50,280<br>slash slash is basically a floor or you know getting the integer portion of the division so 5 slash</p>
<p>330<br>00:37:50,280 –&gt; 00:37:59,640<br>slash 3 gives me 1 right it truncates the fraction the percent gives me the remainder</p>
<p>331<br>00:37:59,639 –&gt; 00:38:07,559<br>so 5% 3 gives me the remainder when I divide 5 by 3 so it’s going to give me give it to me in a</p>
<p>332<br>00:38:07,559 –&gt; 00:38:13,400<br>whole number right so that’s going to be 2 because there’s 2 left over when I divide 5 by 3</p>
<p>333<br>00:38:15,319 –&gt; 00:38:21,159<br>so these are pretty useful operations the the slash slash and the percent when when we do</p>
<p>334<br>00:38:21,159 –&gt; 00:38:27,799<br>sort of mathematical programs the last thing is the star star is how we denote power</p>
<p>335<br>00:38:27,800 –&gt; 00:38:34,760<br>exponentiation kind of different than then you might be used to in math so 2 to the power of 3</p>
<p>336<br>00:38:35,480 –&gt; 00:38:43,560<br>8 right 2 to the power of 3.0 8.0 and the rules for integer integer division</p>
<p>337<br>00:38:44,360 –&gt; 00:38:50,680<br>percent and exponentiation are just like addition subtraction multiplication if one is a float</p>
<p>338<br>00:38:50,679 –&gt; 00:39:02,039<br>then the result will be a float as well okay yeah okay and we talked about type of output</p>
<p>339<br>00:39:04,039 –&gt; 00:39:09,879<br>so I think I briefly mentioned this the operator precedence is exponentiation and then multiplication</p>
<p>340<br>00:39:09,879 –&gt; 00:39:15,639<br>division percent or remainder at the next level and then addition subtraction at the bottom but</p>
<p>341<br>00:39:15,639 –&gt; 00:39:25,079<br>you can always override these using parentheses okay question so far before we move on yes</p>
<p>342<br>00:39:25,960 –&gt; 00:39:32,359<br>so why is division of y is always result of like 9 by 3 and that’s why does it stay in the same</p>
<p>343<br>00:39:32,359 –&gt; 00:39:38,839<br>yeah so the question is why does it always result in a float if it didn’t I think it would the</p>
<p>344<br>00:39:38,839 –&gt; 00:39:44,359<br>operation itself would have to do extra work to figure out whether it’s a whole number or not</p>
<p>345<br>00:39:44,360 –&gt; 00:39:52,120<br>so I think it’s just easier that it gives us always a float I guess previous versions of Python the</p>
<p>346<br>00:39:52,120 –&gt; 00:39:59,000<br>slash was actually I think integer division which is super counterintuitive because you would use</p>
<p>347<br>00:39:59,000 –&gt; 00:40:02,760<br>that in your program and then you would basically enter your divide and things would go wrong</p>
<p>348<br>00:40:03,400 –&gt; 00:40:09,640<br>but again I just a design choice on behalf of the programmers yeah other questions so far</p>
<p>349<br>00:40:10,599 –&gt; 00:40:19,559<br>okay so we have a lot of objects right objects have different types again floats integers booleans</p>
<p>350<br>00:40:20,279 –&gt; 00:40:25,799<br>what can we do with them right so far they’re kind of just sitting in there and we can get properties</p>
<p>351<br>00:40:25,799 –&gt; 00:40:30,759<br>about them but what we’d like to do is write programs basically trying to automate some things about</p>
<p>352<br>00:40:30,759 –&gt; 00:40:37,079<br>these objects manipulate them to help us achieve you know a more complicated and interesting program</p>
<p>353<br>00:40:37,400 –&gt; 00:40:46,759<br>so what we can do to get to that to that end is to start assigning names to some of these objects</p>
<p>354<br>00:40:47,639 –&gt; 00:40:56,360<br>okay if I create an object for pie right in my program to 20 decimal places somehow and I have</p>
<p>355<br>00:40:56,360 –&gt; 00:41:01,960<br>that number in my program that float in my program if I want to use that number in many different</p>
<p>356<br>00:41:01,960 –&gt; 00:41:07,320<br>places in my program I’d have to copy and paste it a whole bunch of times right so far</p>
<p>357<br>00:41:08,760 –&gt; 00:41:14,679<br>which is very tedious lots of errors will happen right I don’t want to do that so instead what I can</p>
<p>358<br>00:41:14,679 –&gt; 00:41:21,639<br>do is I can give a name to this ridiculously long value of pi called pi right and then I can</p>
<p>359<br>00:41:21,639 –&gt; 00:41:27,000<br>just use this name anywhere I want to grab that ridiculously long value for pi in my program</p>
<p>360<br>00:41:27,639 –&gt; 00:41:33,719<br>it’s a lot easier to read right it’s a lot easier for me to write this program and you know it</p>
<p>361<br>00:41:34,679 –&gt; 00:41:41,800<br>it leads to a really nice and neat program so what we can do is we can start saying that you know</p>
<p>362<br>00:41:41,800 –&gt; 00:41:49,719<br>the float point 001 will be referenced by the name small or you know the the 100.4 will be</p>
<p>363<br>00:41:49,719 –&gt; 00:41:56,519<br>referenced by the name temp so what we want to do is create these things called variables and a</p>
<p>364<br>00:41:56,519 –&gt; 00:42:03,000<br>variable is different in computer science from a mathematical variable or variables that you’ve</p>
<p>365<br>00:42:03,000 –&gt; 00:42:07,879<br>known so far in math so math variables come back to the idea of declarative knowledge right a</p>
<p>366<br>00:42:07,879 –&gt; 00:42:14,039<br>declarative statement you can have something like a plus b is equal to b minus 1 in math right or</p>
<p>367<br>00:42:14,039 –&gt; 00:42:20,599<br>x is equal to x or x times x is equal to y and that’s perfectly okay right in math we basically say</p>
<p>368<br>00:42:20,599 –&gt; 00:42:27,239<br>that variable x represents all the square roots of y that’s not going to fly in computer science</p>
<p>369<br>00:42:27,960 –&gt; 00:42:33,320<br>computer science we don’t have right we don’t do declarative knowledge we do imperative knowledge</p>
<p>370<br>00:42:33,320 –&gt; 00:42:40,519<br>and so what we’re working with in computer science is a bunch of assignment statements so what we</p>
<p>371<br>00:42:40,519 –&gt; 00:42:48,199<br>can do in computer science is we’re going to basically bind a value to a variable so I’m going to</p>
<p>372<br>00:42:48,199 –&gt; 00:42:53,000<br>say this variable name is bound to this value every time I want to grab this value I’m going to</p>
<p>373<br>00:42:53,000 –&gt; 00:43:00,440<br>invoke this variable name so here are some examples I’ve got a is equal to b plus 1 the thing on</p>
<p>374<br>00:43:00,440 –&gt; 00:43:06,920<br>the right hand side will evaluate to some value as long as I have something that be you know b</p>
<p>375<br>00:43:07,639 –&gt; 00:43:15,960<br>as a value for I’ve got here m is equal to 10 right so m is a variable its value is 10 I’ve got f is</p>
<p>376<br>00:43:15,960 –&gt; 00:43:23,159<br>equal to m times 9.98 so again I have an expression on the right hand side and that’s okay I’m going</p>
<p>377<br>00:43:23,159 –&gt; 00:43:32,599<br>to use the value of 10 so f’s value will be 99.8 yeah I’m going to put it so that like for f is</p>
<p>378<br>00:43:32,599 –&gt; 00:43:37,400<br>it like this one value of m or can you have it so it’s going to do whatever m x and you use it</p>
<p>379<br>00:43:38,599 –&gt; 00:43:44,360<br>yeah the question is can you have m whatever it recently is so in this particular case I just have</p>
<p>380<br>00:43:44,360 –&gt; 00:43:50,599<br>these two lines and m will be whatever 10 is but we’ll see in a couple lectures that we can write</p>
<p>381<br>00:43:50,599 –&gt; 00:43:57,400<br>like a loop where you change m and then every time you change m you read immediately calculate f</p>
<p>382<br>00:43:58,200 –&gt; 00:44:03,320<br>and then it’ll calculate f based on the new value of m but if we just have these two lines</p>
<p>383<br>00:44:03,320 –&gt; 00:44:13,240<br>that’s that’s all there is it just uses 10 was there another question okay so in computer science</p>
<p>384<br>00:44:13,240 –&gt; 00:44:18,599<br>variable you have only one variable to the left of this equal sign called the assignment operator</p>
<p>385<br>00:44:18,599 –&gt; 00:44:24,599<br>and you have a value to the right hand side of the equal sign the assignment operator okay so one</p>
<p>386<br>00:44:24,599 –&gt; 00:44:34,199<br>variable basically maps to or binds to one value so the equal sign is an assignment statement</p>
<p>387<br>00:44:34,199 –&gt; 00:44:39,880<br>it’s not equality it’s not a solve for x type of situation it’s just an assignment it binds this</p>
<p>388<br>00:44:39,880 –&gt; 00:44:48,199<br>name to this value so the way that we figure out the name with the value is well if we have this</p>
<p>389<br>00:44:48,199 –&gt; 00:44:53,000<br>assignment statement here we first look at the right hand side so we always start with the right</p>
<p>390<br>00:44:53,000 –&gt; 00:44:59,480<br>hand side and we evaluate it remember we have an expression on the right we have to evaluate it</p>
<p>391<br>00:44:59,480 –&gt; 00:45:08,519<br>to one value so this will be 3.14 whatever it is 1.159 and then we take that value and bind it to</p>
<p>392<br>00:45:08,519 –&gt; 00:45:15,639<br>the name pi so anytime I type in p i pi in my program from now on Python will automatically grab</p>
<p>393<br>00:45:15,639 –&gt; 00:45:24,039<br>3.14159 from memory right so it’s bound to that value now okay there are some rules that I have</p>
<p>394<br>00:45:24,039 –&gt; 00:45:33,239<br>them on the previous one yes there are some rules to variable names but we’ll talk about that in</p>
<p>395<br>00:45:33,239 –&gt; 00:45:39,400<br>a bit for now I want you to tell me if any of the following are allowed if I do x is equal to 6 is</p>
<p>396<br>00:45:39,400 –&gt; 00:45:45,320<br>that allowed in Python yes it is good because I have one variable name bound to one value 6 what</p>
<p>397<br>00:45:45,320 –&gt; 00:45:55,079<br>about 6 equals x it’s just backward okay good 6 equals x is bad syntax error how about x times y</p>
<p>398<br>00:45:55,079 –&gt; 00:46:01,720<br>equals 3 plus 4 nope exactly because the thing on the left has an operator in it and operators are</p>
<p>399<br>00:46:01,719 –&gt; 00:46:07,719<br>special right so it can’t have you can’t have a variable with that star as a name how about x</p>
<p>400<br>00:46:07,719 –&gt; 00:46:15,000<br>y equals 3 plus 4 allowed yes exactly I was hoping to get you guys with that but I didn’t x y equals</p>
<p>401<br>00:46:15,000 –&gt; 00:46:22,199<br>3 plus 4 is okay there was no error and then I can invoke the name of the variable I just created</p>
<p>402<br>00:46:22,199 –&gt; 00:46:29,399<br>simply by typing it in so if I type in x y it gives me 7 right and then I can do operations with it x</p>
<p>403<br>00:46:29,400 –&gt; 00:46:41,400<br>y plus 1 is 8 right yeah so those are strings right sequences of characters here these are</p>
<p>404<br>00:46:41,400 –&gt; 00:46:48,920<br>variables so these are names that I I am giving to as a variable yeah that’s a great question so</p>
<p>405<br>00:46:48,920 –&gt; 00:46:53,639<br>this is going to be a string and you notice it it changed color right it has some meaning in</p>
<p>406<br>00:46:53,639 –&gt; 00:47:08,039<br>Python but x y is a variable that I I create yeah okay so why do we want to give names to variables</p>
<p>407<br>00:47:08,039 –&gt; 00:47:14,519<br>because as I showed you with the pi example it’s a lot easier to write code write readable code</p>
<p>408<br>00:47:14,519 –&gt; 00:47:22,199<br>if you have variable names within within your programs so when you grab when you write programs</p>
<p>409<br>00:47:22,199 –&gt; 00:47:27,879<br>it’s important to choose variable names wisely you don’t want to use just single letters you don’t</p>
<p>410<br>00:47:27,879 –&gt; 00:47:31,480<br>want to name it something that doesn’t have something to do with the program you’re writing</p>
<p>411<br>00:47:32,359 –&gt; 00:47:37,559<br>because you’re going to want to reread these programs sometime in the future or others might</p>
<p>412<br>00:47:37,559 –&gt; 00:47:43,799<br>want to read your programs sometime in the future so here’s an example of a nice program it’s just</p>
<p>413<br>00:47:43,799 –&gt; 00:47:50,039<br>basically for assignment statements that do some calculations the first line of the program is not</p>
<p>414<br>00:47:50,039 –&gt; 00:47:55,400<br>really a line it’s called a comment you can have as many of these as you’d like they start with a</p>
<p>415<br>00:47:55,400 –&gt; 00:48:02,599<br>hash it’s a line that starts with a hash and it’s basically a text that you write that helps you</p>
<p>416<br>00:48:03,400 –&gt; 00:48:09,239<br>or others figure out what the code is supposed to do and usually we comment sort of large chunks of</p>
<p>417<br>00:48:09,239 –&gt; 00:48:18,440<br>code at a time not line by line then we have these four equal for assignment statements so here I’m</p>
<p>418<br>00:48:18,440 –&gt; 00:48:26,119<br>defining variable named pi bound to the value here so not the division but 3.14159 variable named</p>
<p>419<br>00:48:26,119 –&gt; 00:48:32,280<br>radius bound to this float 2.2 and then I have a variable named area which is bound to the result</p>
<p>420<br>00:48:32,280 –&gt; 00:48:40,519<br>of this expression okay so when Python sees my pi and my radius it grabs them from memory replaces</p>
<p>421<br>00:48:40,519 –&gt; 00:48:48,759<br>them with the values evaluates the expression grabs that one value that we evaluated to 15.0</p>
<p>422<br>00:48:48,759 –&gt; 00:48:55,400<br>something whatever this is and binds the 15.0 something to the name area same with circumference</p>
<p>423<br>00:48:59,719 –&gt; 00:49:03,719<br>code style is something that we’re actually going to look at in your problem sets so I just wanted</p>
<p>424<br>00:49:03,719 –&gt; 00:49:10,279<br>to quickly talk about that here is a program that has really bad style actually that shouldn’t be</p>
<p>425<br>00:49:10,279 –&gt; 00:49:15,879<br>it should be you know terrible or something like that but it’s in case you haven’t noticed it’s the</p>
<p>426<br>00:49:15,879 –&gt; 00:49:21,159<br>same program as on the previous slide but if I gave you this program straight off the bat you probably</p>
<p>427<br>00:49:21,159 –&gt; 00:49:29,159<br>wouldn’t know what it’s doing it’s reusing 355 over 1 1 3 twice here it’s using just a and c as</p>
<p>428<br>00:49:29,159 –&gt; 00:49:37,159<br>variable names it’s description is due calculations so pretty bad this is a little bit better I’ve</p>
<p>429<br>00:49:37,159 –&gt; 00:49:45,960<br>recognized that 355 over 1 1 3 is being used twice so I’m saving it as a variable but my variables</p>
<p>430<br>00:49:45,960 –&gt; 00:49:53,879<br>are still single characters and my comments are pretty bad I’m basically saying what the code is</p>
<p>431<br>00:49:53,880 –&gt; 00:50:01,880<br>doing please don’t do that we can see that a equals p times r times r right I see that I’m</p>
<p>432<br>00:50:01,880 –&gt; 00:50:08,519<br>multiplying p with r squared I don’t need to read that in English right what I would like to see</p>
<p>433<br>00:50:08,519 –&gt; 00:50:15,880<br>is a comment like this here I’m commenting you know a chunk of code and someone who doesn’t want to</p>
<p>434<br>00:50:15,880 –&gt; 00:50:20,360<br>read this chunk of code just reads the comment and I already know that I’m calculating the area</p>
<p>435<br>00:50:20,360 –&gt; 00:50:27,320<br>and circumference using an approximation for pi that’s a pretty nice comment there and good</p>
<p>436<br>00:50:27,320 –&gt; 00:50:36,120<br>descriptive names and all that so we can actually once we create an object a variable sorry once we</p>
<p>437<br>00:50:36,120 –&gt; 00:50:42,840<br>create an object and bind it to a variable we can change the bindings so we can take that variable</p>
<p>438<br>00:50:43,400 –&gt; 00:50:50,200<br>and bind it to a completely different value this might not be sort of useful right now but it</p>
<p>439<br>00:50:50,200 –&gt; 00:50:58,360<br>will be useful when we introduce control flow in our programs so to rebind a variable what that</p>
<p>440<br>00:50:58,360 –&gt; 00:51:03,880<br>means is we’re going to take the name we’re going to lose the binding to the previous value and</p>
<p>441<br>00:51:03,880 –&gt; 00:51:09,000<br>we’re going to rebind it to a new value so I’m going to show you how this looks like in memory I’m</p>
<p>442<br>00:51:09,000 –&gt; 00:51:15,400<br>going to use this sort of cloud picture to represent what happens behind the scenes whenever we write</p>
<p>443<br>00:51:15,400 –&gt; 00:51:20,119<br>programs and it’s like a little animation to help you understand line by line what’s going on</p>
<p>444<br>00:51:20,920 –&gt; 00:51:29,000<br>so here we have pi equals 3.14 so the green 3.14 is my value in memory cloud is memory that’s my</p>
<p>445<br>00:51:29,000 –&gt; 00:51:36,519<br>value in memory and it’s bound to this name pi so this is my variable name the next line radius</p>
<p>446<br>00:51:36,519 –&gt; 00:51:43,239<br>equals 2.2 same thing I’ve got 2.2 as my value in memory my object and radius is the name for that</p>
<p>447<br>00:51:43,239 –&gt; 00:51:50,440<br>object area equals pi times radius squared so what happens behind the scenes is it calculates this</p>
<p>448<br>00:51:50,440 –&gt; 00:51:55,719<br>value right it doesn’t store the expression it stores the value resulting from the calculation</p>
<p>449<br>00:51:55,719 –&gt; 00:52:03,559<br>and then it saves it it or binds it to the name area okay everything okay so far we’ve seen this</p>
<p>450<br>00:52:03,559 –&gt; 00:52:10,519<br>code before cool so now what happens when we do this radius equals radius plus one in math</p>
<p>451<br>00:52:12,599 –&gt; 00:52:18,199<br>that would say zero equals one but we’re not in math here right we’re in computer science and</p>
<p>452<br>00:52:18,199 –&gt; 00:52:25,960<br>this is perfectly valid we’re following the rule right when we have an assignment that says look</p>
<p>453<br>00:52:25,960 –&gt; 00:52:33,159<br>at the right hand side first and evaluate it and then bind it to the left hand side so if we look</p>
<p>454<br>00:52:33,159 –&gt; 00:52:41,559<br>at the right hand side first right we see radius well what’s the value 2.2 we see add one to it</p>
<p>455<br>00:52:42,519 –&gt; 00:52:49,879<br>3.2 save that in memory and then we see the assignment now save it with the name radius</p>
<p>456<br>00:52:51,799 –&gt; 00:52:59,000<br>okay so we can only have one variable assigned to one value at a time right this is not</p>
<p>457<br>00:52:59,000 –&gt; 00:53:04,119<br>math this computer science so you can only have radius point two one thing at a time</p>
<p>458<br>00:53:05,480 –&gt; 00:53:12,039<br>with this line of code radius equals radius plus one we’ve lost the binding to 2.2 this object in</p>
<p>459<br>00:53:12,039 –&gt; 00:53:20,519<br>memory and we’ve rebounded it to the value 3.2 okay and that’s perfectly fine 2.2 is now just</p>
<p>460<br>00:53:20,519 –&gt; 00:53:26,440<br>sitting in memory we can’t get back to it unless we say maybe radius equals 2.2 it just sits in memory</p>
<p>461<br>00:53:26,440 –&gt; 00:53:31,400<br>and then you know might be collected later on by or reclaimed by garbage collection or something</p>
<p>462<br>00:53:31,400 –&gt; 00:53:38,039<br>like that but for now we can’t get back to it now what’s the value for area at the end of these lines</p>
<p>463<br>00:53:39,800 –&gt; 00:53:46,119<br>well according to this it’s 15.1976 so it’s using the old 2.2 value for radius</p>
<p>464<br>00:53:47,800 –&gt; 00:53:55,880<br>and that’s okay because the program never told uh never had a line that said recalculate area</p>
<p>465<br>00:53:55,880 –&gt; 00:54:04,119<br>after we change the radius right it’s just following dumb line by line right it doesn’t know that</p>
<p>466<br>00:54:04,119 –&gt; 00:54:09,960<br>hey if I change the radius the user might want the area changed right it doesn’t make those connections</p>
<p>467<br>00:54:09,960 –&gt; 00:54:15,800<br>it’s just following instructions and that’s okay if we wanted to change the area we would have to</p>
<p>468<br>00:54:15,800 –&gt; 00:54:21,880<br>copy this line and paste it after we’ve changed the radius and then the area would change as well</p>
<p>469<br>00:54:21,880 –&gt; 00:54:29,079<br>okay does that make sense that’s kind of an important part of this lecture okay cool</p>
<p>470<br>00:54:30,519 –&gt; 00:54:35,480<br>so big idea here is our lines are evaluated one after the other we’re not skipping we’re not</p>
<p>471<br>00:54:35,480 –&gt; 00:54:40,440<br>repeating things that’s something we’re going to learn about later um but for now line by line</p>
<p>472<br>00:54:41,800 –&gt; 00:54:47,559<br>so here’s a little you try it um these three lines are executed in order what are the values</p>
<p>473<br>00:54:47,559 –&gt; 00:54:53,480<br>for meters and feet variables at each line so how about at the first line what’s the value for</p>
<p>474<br>00:54:53,480 –&gt; 00:55:03,880<br>meters after we execute the first line 100 what about feet so feet at at the end of the first</p>
<p>475<br>00:55:03,880 –&gt; 00:55:10,599<br>line there is no value for feet yet how about after the second line 328.8 right how about the</p>
<p>476<br>00:55:10,599 –&gt; 00:55:21,000<br>value for meters 100 still and what about after the third line I’m changing meters to 200 exactly</p>
<p>477<br>00:55:21,000 –&gt; 00:55:29,960<br>yeah meters is 200 but feet is still 328.08 and this is something I want to show you guys today</p>
<p>478<br>00:55:29,960 –&gt; 00:55:36,759<br>and we’re going to use this Python tutor a lot more in the future Python tutor is a nice website</p>
<p>479<br>00:55:36,760 –&gt; 00:55:44,520<br>that allows you to step in your code step through your code step by step so at each line that you</p>
<p>480<br>00:55:44,520 –&gt; 00:55:49,720<br>execute you get to see the values of all the variables in the code it very useful debugging tool I</p>
<p>481<br>00:55:49,720 –&gt; 00:55:54,840<br>hope you’ll try it out today and uh on Monday maybe for the finger exercises if you’re if you’re</p>
<p>482<br>00:55:54,840 –&gt; 00:56:00,280<br>having trouble and you know you can use it for quizzes uh to help you debug but we can I can just</p>
<p>483<br>00:56:00,280 –&gt; 00:56:06,520<br>show you it’s pretty simple uh here because it’s just a step by step so we step through so the red</p>
<p>484<br>00:56:06,519 –&gt; 00:56:11,559<br>says the line I’m going to execute green is the line I just executed so I just executed meters</p>
<p>485<br>00:56:11,559 –&gt; 00:56:18,039<br>a hundred so here I have my meters variable with the value 100 step through next so I just</p>
<p>486<br>00:56:18,039 –&gt; 00:56:26,759<br>executed feet equals this so I now have a variable named feet within a value 328.08 meters still 100</p>
<p>487<br>00:56:26,759 –&gt; 00:56:35,800<br>and then meters 200 feet remained 328.08 okay so obviously this is a pretty simple program to</p>
<p>488<br>00:56:35,800 –&gt; 00:56:45,160<br>run the Python tutor on but you can imagine using it in uh in more complex settings how about one</p>
<p>489<br>00:56:45,160 –&gt; 00:56:51,880<br>more and this is my last example I want you to try to write a program that swaps the values of x and y</p>
<p>490<br>00:56:51,880 –&gt; 00:56:58,920<br>so originally and I’ll draw this the memory diagram real quick so we have this is our memory we have</p>
<p>491<br>00:56:58,920 –&gt; 00:57:08,760<br>x is bound to one y is bound to two and what I want to do without saying x equals two y equals one</p>
<p>492<br>00:57:08,760 –&gt; 00:57:14,920<br>what I want to do is swap the values I want x to be associated with two and y to be associated with one</p>
<p>493<br>00:57:14,920 –&gt; 00:57:24,200<br>but only using commands like this right and so the code here is buggy that means it’s wrong it has</p>
<p>494<br>00:57:24,199 –&gt; 00:57:30,919<br>an error in it because well let’s step through let’s step through a little bit at a time y equals x</p>
<p>495<br>00:57:32,119 –&gt; 00:57:44,039<br>what do I do when y equals x here yeah exactly why is going to move from two to one now what happens</p>
<p>496<br>00:57:44,039 –&gt; 00:57:52,919<br>when I do x equals y yes x stays the same my first line y equals x lost the binding to two</p>
<p>497<br>00:57:53,720 –&gt; 00:58:00,599<br>right and now it’s almost up because I can’t get it back so instead so if you didn’t understand</p>
<p>498<br>00:58:00,599 –&gt; 00:58:06,200<br>this you can click Python tutor and just kind of step through step by step on your own but how can</p>
<p>499<br>00:58:06,200 –&gt; 00:58:14,920<br>we fix this create a third variable yeah that’s a great idea yeah we can create a third variable so</p>
<p>500<br>00:58:14,920 –&gt; 00:58:20,280<br>x is one y is one uh y is two so we can create a third variable what do you want to make the variable</p>
<p>501<br>00:58:20,280 –&gt; 00:58:31,800<br>equal to x or y yeah either one um I made it y so let’s do y um so here I’ve got a temporary</p>
<p>502<br>00:58:31,800 –&gt; 00:58:43,320<br>variable called temp and I made it equal to two and now what can I do which one can I reassign now</p>
<p>503<br>00:58:43,320 –&gt; 00:58:51,480<br>x equals y or y equals x exactly y equals if I do x equals y I lose my binding to one and I’m</p>
<p>504<br>00:58:52,440 –&gt; 00:58:57,400<br>I messed up again so y equals x is okay to do so I’m going to lose the binding from y</p>
<p>505<br>00:58:58,519 –&gt; 00:59:07,080<br>from two and bind it up to one and now what do I do yeah now I can safely reassign x to</p>
<p>506<br>00:59:07,079 –&gt; 00:59:17,079<br>temp right so I can say x is equal to temp because temp points to two and I want to make x point to two as</p>
<p>507<br>00:59:17,079 –&gt; 00:59:24,679<br>well so in terms of code so that’s sort of the diagram but um you know we can write the code so you</p>
<p>508<br>00:59:24,679 –&gt; 00:59:31,960<br>don’t uh let’s see um we don’t write it in here but you know on on your own or uh you can write it</p>
<p>509<br>00:59:31,960 –&gt; 00:59:39,159<br>in here if you like or we can do it together so x is equal oops x equals one y equals two right um</p>
<p>510<br>00:59:39,159 –&gt; 00:59:46,440<br>and then we can have we had temp we wanted to assign it to whatever y was right so we say temp is equal to y</p>
<p>511<br>00:59:48,280 –&gt; 00:59:53,480<br>and if you want to check the values of the variables you can just invoke the names right so x is one</p>
<p>512<br>00:59:53,480 –&gt; 01:00:04,840<br>y is two and temp should be whatever y is two okay good so far so now I’m at the step</p>
<p>513<br>01:00:05,960 –&gt; 01:00:11,400<br>here I think right I’ve just created this and then the last thing I need to do is lose the binding</p>
<p>514<br>01:00:12,039 –&gt; 01:00:19,320<br>from x to whatever temp is right so I want to do this operation here which means I want to</p>
<p>515<br>01:00:19,320 –&gt; 01:00:34,920<br>assign x to be equal to temp right so now x is two y is what what did I do yeah let’s so this</p>
<p>516<br>01:00:34,920 –&gt; 01:00:44,760<br>happens sometimes we can just start all over right so y equals temp or sorry sorry temp equals y</p>
<p>517<br>01:00:49,480 –&gt; 01:01:02,920<br>y equals x y is one x is one and then x equals temp y is one x is two okay so it’s okay if things go wrong</p>
<p>518<br>01:01:04,519 –&gt; 01:01:09,800<br>they will go wrong we can just start all over in this particular case by redefining our variables</p>
<p>519<br>01:01:09,800 –&gt; 01:01:14,200<br>and just trying it out all over again so that’s kind of what the shell is for that’s what I use</p>
<p>520<br>01:01:14,199 –&gt; 01:01:19,000<br>it for that’s what we’re going to use it for in the future just to do quick things like this</p>
<p>521<br>01:01:20,039 –&gt; 01:01:25,799<br>you know and also things like checking the types and and other commands we’ve done earlier</p>
<p>522<br>01:01:27,639 –&gt; 01:01:33,719<br>okay so any questions before we do the summary was this all right pace or was it too fast or</p>
<p>523<br>01:01:34,359 –&gt; 01:01:42,039<br>okay go okay good thumbs up is good so let’s do a quick summary we saw that we can create</p>
<p>524<br>01:01:42,759 –&gt; 01:01:48,759<br>programs by manipulating objects we created objects in python and we saw that objects have a</p>
<p>525<br>01:01:48,759 –&gt; 01:01:54,759<br>particular type the type that the object has tells python the things that you can do with that object</p>
<p>526<br>01:01:55,559 –&gt; 01:02:04,360<br>right we can combine objects in expressions and these expressions evaluate or boil down to one</p>
<p>527<br>01:02:04,360 –&gt; 01:02:11,480<br>particular value objects or values can be stored in variables and these variables allow us to</p>
<p>528<br>01:02:11,480 –&gt; 01:02:17,559<br>access these values with nicer names later on in our program and and then we’re able to write</p>
<p>529<br>01:02:17,559 –&gt; 01:02:23,960<br>meter more legible programs as well right so the equal sign I showed you a couple of differences</p>
<p>530<br>01:02:23,960 –&gt; 01:02:30,519<br>between math and computer science the equal sign was one notable difference right the equal sign</p>
<p>531<br>01:02:30,519 –&gt; 01:02:35,320<br>in math is declarative and the equal sign in computer science is an assignment you’re basically</p>
<p>532<br>01:02:35,320 –&gt; 01:02:41,800<br>saying this is associated with this right and we’re not doing any sort of equality in computer science</p>
<p>533<br>01:02:44,360 –&gt; 01:02:51,880<br>and yes computers do what you tell them to do that’s kind of the big the big thing here right line by</p>
<p>534<br>01:02:51,880 –&gt; 01:02:58,199<br>line it executes starting from the top goes line by line so far we haven’t seen any places where we</p>
