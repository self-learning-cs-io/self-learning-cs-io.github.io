                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:13,359<br>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:13,359 –&gt; 00:00:16,080<br>So today’s lecture will be super short.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,080 –&gt; 00:00:21,719<br>We’ve got a 45 minute quiz on object-oriented programming classes, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:21,719 –&gt; 00:00:27,080<br>So I wanted to give you guys an extra bit of time to work through three programming problems.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:27,079 –&gt; 00:00:33,159<br>But the actual lecture part, we’re going to switch gears a little bit, and we’re going</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:33,159 –&gt; 00:00:40,159<br>to start talking about something more theoretical, which is how to figure out whether the programs</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:40,159 –&gt; 00:00:43,959<br>we write are efficient and how efficient are they.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:43,959 –&gt; 00:00:49,399<br>So we’re going to do that today using the idea of timing our programs and then counting</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:49,399 –&gt; 00:00:51,719<br>number of operations as I’ll describe it in a little bit.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:52,240 –&gt; 00:00:54,039<br>First of all, a little bit of motivation.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:54,039 –&gt; 00:00:57,960<br>So why do we actually care about this topic?</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:57,960 –&gt; 00:01:03,359<br>It’s a topic that’s a high research area on computer science.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:03,359 –&gt; 00:01:06,439<br>So far in this class, though, we’ve emphasized correctness, right?</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:06,439 –&gt; 00:01:12,239<br>In problem sets, the unit tests check whether that the programs you wrote were correct.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:12,239 –&gt; 00:01:18,719<br>In quizzes, we basically look at how many test cases you pass, right, and to determine the grade.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:18,719 –&gt; 00:01:23,760<br>But these days, we actually have a whole bunch of data coming at us, right?</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:23,760 –&gt; 00:01:30,039<br>So we have a lot of data that we need to analyze, we need to read, we need to visualize, we need</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:30,039 –&gt; 00:01:31,840<br>to make sense of.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,840 –&gt; 00:01:36,519<br>And so the programs that we write, yes, they have to be correct, which is a large part of</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:36,519 –&gt; 00:01:39,719<br>it, but they also have to be fast, right?</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:39,719 –&gt; 00:01:46,400<br>So if it takes a year to analyze a bunch of information on YouTube videos, nobody’s</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:46,400 –&gt; 00:01:48,800<br>going to really want to wait that long, right?</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:48,800 –&gt; 00:01:54,440<br>And so we’re going to emphasize in the next three or four lectures, I forget exactly</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:54,440 –&gt; 00:01:59,719<br>how many, but the next little section in this class, the idea of how to determine the</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:59,719 –&gt; 00:02:01,440<br>efficiency of our programs.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:01,440 –&gt; 00:02:02,439<br>Okay?</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:02,439 –&gt; 00:02:07,120<br>So when we’re talking about efficiency, we can talk about the time efficiency of programs</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:07,120 –&gt; 00:02:10,200<br>and also the space efficiency of programs.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:10,200 –&gt; 00:02:13,280<br>And usually there’s going to be a trade-off between these two.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:13,280 –&gt; 00:02:18,159<br>So very rarely these days, can you come up with an algorithm that’s both efficient in</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:18,159 –&gt; 00:02:22,360<br>time and space compared to algorithms that are already out there.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:22,360 –&gt; 00:02:28,520<br>So usually there’s a trade-off, and the best example is the one that we saw with Fibonacci.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:28,520 –&gt; 00:02:33,080<br>So we saw a code that was recursive to calculate Fibonacci.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:33,080 –&gt; 00:02:37,159<br>So Fibonacci of N was Fibonacci of N minus 1 plus Fibonacci of N minus 2, right?</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:37,159 –&gt; 00:02:40,159<br>That was our recursive step.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:40,159 –&gt; 00:02:47,280<br>That program that was recursive took something like 30 million steps to calculate Fibonacci</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:47,280 –&gt; 00:02:48,280<br>of 30 something, right?</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:48,280 –&gt; 00:02:52,759<br>It was 30 million recursive calls, which was pretty slow.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:52,759 –&gt; 00:02:55,240<br>It took a couple of seconds for it to run.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:55,240 –&gt; 00:02:57,319<br>But then we saw a version with memoization.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:57,319 –&gt; 00:02:59,439<br>Now, there’s no arm missing there.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:59,439 –&gt; 00:03:03,719<br>It’s just memoization, sort of the process of keeping a memo through a dictionary in that</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:03,719 –&gt; 00:03:05,719<br>particular case.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:05,719 –&gt; 00:03:11,479<br>And the memoization idea was that we would take some values that we calculate, and as</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:11,479 –&gt; 00:03:14,079<br>we calculate them, store them in the memo.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:14,079 –&gt; 00:03:22,800<br>So in the memoization example, we had given up some of our memory to store these values</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:22,800 –&gt; 00:03:24,439<br>so that we didn’t have to compute them.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:24,439 –&gt; 00:03:29,639<br>And in the process of doing so, we had a program that ran really, really quick, right?</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:29,639 –&gt; 00:03:34,079<br>Much quicker than the plane recursive version that we had originally seen.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:34,080 –&gt; 00:03:35,440<br>So there’s this trade-off, right?</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:35,440 –&gt; 00:03:39,960<br>Where you have a program that’s fast, but might store some values and take up more memory,</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:39,960 –&gt; 00:03:44,840<br>or a program that doesn’t store anything, but then is not going to be as fast.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:44,840 –&gt; 00:03:50,200<br>It’s going to be slower because it needs to keep computing a bunch of different values.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:50,200 –&gt; 00:03:55,800<br>So what we’re going to do in this lecture is kind of show you a very simple way of figuring</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:55,800 –&gt; 00:03:59,800<br>out how efficient our programs are, which is we’re just going to time them, and then we’re</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:59,800 –&gt; 00:04:03,520<br>going to count the number of operations that these programs take.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:03,520 –&gt; 00:04:07,080<br>But we’re going to do so with the idea in the back of our mind that there’s going to</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:07,080 –&gt; 00:04:11,120<br>be a better way to figure out the efficiency of these programs.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:11,120 –&gt; 00:04:15,800<br>And ultimately, we don’t really want to figure out the efficiency of an implementation,</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:15,800 –&gt; 00:04:16,800<br>right?</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:16,800 –&gt; 00:04:23,800<br>An implementation means you implement a program that finds us some using a Y loop.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:23,800 –&gt; 00:04:27,160<br>I implement the program to find us some using a formula, right?</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:27,160 –&gt; 00:04:31,280<br>Those are two different implementations, but at their core, the algorithms or behind</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:31,279 –&gt; 00:04:33,559<br>the scenes is going to be the same.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:33,559 –&gt; 00:04:38,519<br>And so what we want to do is to try to figure out how to evaluate algorithms as opposed</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:38,519 –&gt; 00:04:40,199<br>to these different implementations, right?</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:40,199 –&gt; 00:04:43,559<br>Because each one of you is going to come up with a completely different implementation</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:43,559 –&gt; 00:04:45,199<br>for today’s quiz, right?</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:45,199 –&gt; 00:04:46,199<br>But I don’t want to evaluate that.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:46,199 –&gt; 00:04:49,799<br>I would like to evaluate sort of the algorithms behind the scenes.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:49,799 –&gt; 00:04:50,799<br>Okay.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:50,799 –&gt; 00:04:56,199<br>So we’re going to do, like I mentioned, we’re going to today look at measuring how long</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:56,199 –&gt; 00:04:59,199<br>our program takes with an actual timer.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:59,199 –&gt; 00:05:04,519<br>And then we’re going to also count how many operations our program takes.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:04,519 –&gt; 00:05:07,279<br>And then we’re not going to look at this other abstract notion.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:07,279 –&gt; 00:05:11,199<br>We’re going to look at that next lecture.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:11,199 –&gt; 00:05:14,279<br>So today’s lecture, we’re going to use another module.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:14,279 –&gt; 00:05:18,279<br>We’ve been looking at modules in the past couple lectures already, right?</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:18,279 –&gt; 00:05:23,199<br>We’ve seen the random module, which helps us deal with random numbers.</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:23,199 –&gt; 00:05:29,560<br>We’ve seen the date time module, which helps us deal with, or was it date you’d tell,</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:29,560 –&gt; 00:05:36,519<br>something like that, which helps us deal with date time objects and converting dates into</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:36,519 –&gt; 00:05:40,279<br>objects that were nicely usable.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:40,279 –&gt; 00:05:45,959<br>Today we’re going to use the time module, right here, which will help us deal with the</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:45,959 –&gt; 00:05:46,959<br>system clock.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:46,959 –&gt; 00:05:47,959<br>Okay.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:47,959 –&gt; 00:05:51,399<br>So if we’re timing functions that we run, we’re going to want to access the system clock</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:51,399 –&gt; 00:05:56,919<br>to figure out exactly what time we started this function and what time we ended the function.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:56,919 –&gt; 00:06:02,120<br>So just a little thing on, you probably already know this, how to call these functions within</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:02,120 –&gt; 00:06:03,120<br>these modules.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:03,120 –&gt; 00:06:07,560<br>So the modules basically bring in a whole bunch of functions and maybe objects and things</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:07,560 –&gt; 00:06:12,159<br>like that related to one topic, or on subject, into your code.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:12,159 –&gt; 00:06:18,279<br>And then to run the functions in your code, you just use this annotation on the module</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:18,279 –&gt; 00:06:19,279<br>name.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:19,279 –&gt; 00:06:24,239<br>So if you want to use the sign function from the math module, I would just say math.sign</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:24,239 –&gt; 00:06:28,279<br>and then I have access to that sign function.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:28,279 –&gt; 00:06:29,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:29,279 –&gt; 00:06:32,079<br>So let’s start looking at timing a program.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:32,079 –&gt; 00:06:35,879<br>The simplest way to figure out how fast the program runs.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:35,879 –&gt; 00:06:39,599<br>So we’re going to use the time module, so I’m importing it here.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:39,599 –&gt; 00:06:44,519<br>And when I do that, Python is going to bring in all of these functions related to the time.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:44,519 –&gt; 00:06:48,000<br>Now we’re going to look in this particular lecture at three different functions and we’re</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:48,000 –&gt; 00:06:50,879<br>going to time them, each of them.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:50,879 –&gt; 00:06:53,879<br>Next lecture, we’re going to look at a whole bunch more functions just to give you a little</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:53,879 –&gt; 00:06:57,040<br>bit more practice with timing and counting operations.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:57,040 –&gt; 00:07:01,240<br>And then we’ll introduce a more abstract notion of this order of growth.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:01,240 –&gt; 00:07:04,519<br>So the three functions we’re going to look at are these ones.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:04,519 –&gt; 00:07:08,360<br>So Celsius to Fahrenheit, My Sum, and Square.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:08,360 –&gt; 00:07:11,399<br>So Celsius to Fahrenheit, pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:11,399 –&gt; 00:07:16,240<br>It takes in one parameter the number for Celsius temperature and converts it to Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:16,240 –&gt; 00:07:20,400<br>So we did this lecture one, just using the formula.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:20,400 –&gt; 00:07:24,879<br>This function, My Sum, will take it a number x.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:24,879 –&gt; 00:07:28,439<br>So seven or ten or a hundred, whatever it is.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:28,439 –&gt; 00:07:30,879<br>And it uses a loop.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:30,879 –&gt; 00:07:35,680<br>So computationally uses this loop that iterates the each number from zero all the way up to</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:35,680 –&gt; 00:07:39,160<br>including x and keeps the running total.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:39,160 –&gt; 00:07:43,360<br>So it adds i to itself to the total and returns it.</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:43,360 –&gt; 00:07:47,439<br>Of course, we could have rewritten this in a more efficient way by using the formula,</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:47,439 –&gt; 00:07:51,040<br>to calculate the sum, what is n times n plus 1 over 2.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:51,040 –&gt; 00:07:54,400<br>But here, we’re just doing it using this for loop.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:54,400 –&gt; 00:07:59,840<br>And then lastly, is this function called square?</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:59,840 –&gt; 00:08:03,000<br>And this one’s going to be even more inefficient.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:03,000 –&gt; 00:08:05,000<br>We’re going to calculate n squared.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:05,000 –&gt; 00:08:08,520<br>So the parameter here n will be squared.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:08,519 –&gt; 00:08:13,839<br>So we’re not doing return n times n or return n star star 2.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:13,839 –&gt; 00:08:15,120<br>We’re not doing any of that.</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:15,120 –&gt; 00:08:18,719<br>We’re actually going to use two nested loops.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:18,719 –&gt; 00:08:23,879<br>So I’ve got an outer four loop that goes through the number zero to n, not including,</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:23,879 –&gt; 00:08:27,240<br>an inner four loop that goes through the number zero to n, not including.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:27,240 –&gt; 00:08:32,079<br>And this square sum here adds one to itself every time.</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:32,080 –&gt; 00:08:38,840<br>So effectively, we’re going through and adding one to that sum n squared times.</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:38,840 –&gt; 00:08:42,840<br>So super inefficient, but this is where we’re at.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:42,840 –&gt; 00:08:47,040<br>And so how do we actually time these functions?</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:47,040 –&gt; 00:08:52,400<br>So here’s the, this is basically, you know, some lines of code in a file.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:52,400 –&gt; 00:08:55,639<br>So I’ve got the time module imported here.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:55,639 –&gt; 00:08:57,680<br>I’ve got the function here.</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:57,679 –&gt; 00:09:05,479<br>I’m going to call the time module and the time function within the time module.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:05,479 –&gt; 00:09:11,399<br>So this tells me the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st, 1970.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:11,399 –&gt; 00:09:13,599<br>That’s called the epoch.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:13,599 –&gt; 00:09:14,599<br>Okay.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:14,599 –&gt; 00:09:17,039<br>So the beginning of time and computer speak.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:17,039 –&gt; 00:09:23,359<br>So if I grab how many seconds have passed since that time, then T start stores that number</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:23,359 –&gt; 00:09:24,359<br>of seconds.</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:24,360 –&gt; 00:09:28,480<br>I’m going to run my function, Celsius to fan height 37.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:28,480 –&gt; 00:09:33,919<br>And then I’m going to get the time again down here and subtract the time right now after</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:33,919 –&gt; 00:09:39,480<br>the function has finished minus the time it was right before I started my function.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:39,480 –&gt; 00:09:40,480<br>Okay.</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:40,480 –&gt; 00:09:45,240<br>So that gives me the, the DT and then I just print that out.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:45,240 –&gt; 00:09:47,480<br>So we can run it together.</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:47,480 –&gt; 00:09:52,920<br>The way I’m going to run it is by actually doing a little bit of modularization to this</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:52,919 –&gt; 00:09:54,360<br>code.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:54,360 –&gt; 00:09:59,639<br>So I’m at this function and this is the only function I’m actually going to run down here.</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:59,639 –&gt; 00:10:02,519<br>It’s my, I call it a time wrapper.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:02,519 –&gt; 00:10:07,360<br>It’s a wrapper function and it takes in two parameters.</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:07,360 –&gt; 00:10:10,279<br>The first is the actual function I want to run.</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:10,279 –&gt; 00:10:11,399<br>So I’ll show you down here.</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:11,399 –&gt; 00:10:16,319<br>You can see I’m running the time wrapper with the name, literally the name of the function</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:16,319 –&gt; 00:10:17,319<br>I want to run.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:17,319 –&gt; 00:10:18,159<br>This is not a function call.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:18,159 –&gt; 00:10:20,879<br>It’s just the name of my function.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:20,879 –&gt; 00:10:25,159<br>So that’s the first parameter and the second parameter is a whole bunch of different inputs</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:25,159 –&gt; 00:10:27,759<br>I want to run the function with.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:27,759 –&gt; 00:10:34,159<br>So this Ln is created up here and it just makes for me the list of all of these inputs.</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:34,159 –&gt; 00:10:39,039<br>So I’m going to run Celsius to Fahrenheit with the number one, Celsius to Fahrenheit with</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:39,039 –&gt; 00:10:41,439<br>the number 10, Celsius to Fahrenheit with a hundred and so on.</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:41,439 –&gt; 00:10:47,000<br>So these will be all my inputs to my function.</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:47,000 –&gt; 00:10:51,559<br>And so when I call this wrapper Python is just going to replace F with the function that</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:51,559 –&gt; 00:10:52,559<br>I’m actually running.</p>
<p>168<br>00:10:52,559 –&gt; 00:10:55,600<br>So Celsius to Fahrenheit or My Sum or Square.</p>
<p>169<br>00:10:55,600 –&gt; 00:11:00,559<br>And you can see here for each one of the different inputs I’m going to grab the time, run</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:00,559 –&gt; 00:11:07,639<br>the function, grab the time again to get the dt and then print how long it took.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:07,639 –&gt; 00:11:09,279<br>So I’ll show you what that looks like.</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:09,279 –&gt; 00:11:15,960<br>So here I ran Celsius to Fahrenheit with inputs 1, 10, 100,000, 10,000.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:15,960 –&gt; 00:11:22,759<br>It was really fast.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:22,759 –&gt; 00:11:25,400<br>It took zero seconds every single time.</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:25,400 –&gt; 00:11:27,800<br>So no matter what the input, zero seconds.</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:27,800 –&gt; 00:11:32,040<br>So fast that Python didn’t even tell me exactly how slow it was.</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:32,040 –&gt; 00:11:36,720<br>And I’ll tend to the negative 9 or whatever, it’s just zero seconds.</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:36,720 –&gt; 00:11:39,560<br>And that’s in part to the time function, but we’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>179<br>00:11:39,560 –&gt; 00:11:41,480<br>It’s just very fast.</p>
<p>180<br>00:11:41,480 –&gt; 00:11:42,480<br>Okay.</p>
<p>181<br>00:11:42,480 –&gt; 00:11:45,400<br>How about the next function?</p>
<p>182<br>00:11:45,399 –&gt; 00:11:48,519<br>Let’s do My Sum.</p>
<p>183<br>00:11:48,519 –&gt; 00:11:53,039<br>So My Sum is not just doing calculations, it has a loop, right?</p>
<p>184<br>00:11:53,039 –&gt; 00:11:55,319<br>That’s a function of the input.</p>
<p>185<br>00:11:55,319 –&gt; 00:12:00,279<br>So our input changes, and you might have noticed that as our input got bigger, we actually</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:00,279 –&gt; 00:12:04,279<br>had to wait a little while for this result to come by.</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:04,279 –&gt; 00:12:10,360<br>So we see down here, right, or up here, when the input’s pretty small, yes, it took zero</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:10,360 –&gt; 00:12:11,360<br>seconds.</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:11,360 –&gt; 00:12:13,759<br>It’s so fast that it didn’t even register it.</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:13,759 –&gt; 00:12:16,799<br>But at some point, we started to get actual numbers.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:16,799 –&gt; 00:12:27,159<br>So with 10,000, it took 0.0099 seconds, with 100,000, it took 0.01, with what is this</p>
<p>192<br>00:12:27,159 –&gt; 00:12:28,159<br>a million?</p>
<p>193<br>00:12:28,159 –&gt; 00:12:32,399<br>Yeah, with a million, it took 0.05 seconds.</p>
<p>194<br>00:12:32,399 –&gt; 00:12:37,439<br>So we can actually see a little pattern, right, if we stared it long enough, especially</p>
<p>195<br>00:12:37,439 –&gt; 00:12:39,319<br>for the bigger numbers, right?</p>
<p>196<br>00:12:39,320 –&gt; 00:12:43,680<br>So down here, right, these first two are iffy.</p>
<p>197<br>00:12:43,680 –&gt; 00:12:48,520<br>But when we get to a big number like a million, we say it took 0.05 seconds.</p>
<p>198<br>00:12:48,520 –&gt; 00:12:54,120<br>When we increase the input by 10 to 10 million, the input took 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p>199<br>00:12:54,120 –&gt; 00:12:58,560<br>And when we increase the input by 10 again, it took 5 seconds.</p>
<p>200<br>00:12:58,560 –&gt; 00:13:04,800<br>So we could guess that when we increase the input again by 10, it will take about 50 seconds</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:04,800 –&gt; 00:13:05,800<br>to run, right?</p>
<p>202<br>00:13:05,799 –&gt; 00:13:09,399<br>You can even try that out if you’d like to wait for 50 seconds.</p>
<p>203<br>00:13:09,399 –&gt; 00:13:14,639<br>All right, that’s the MySum function.</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:14,639 –&gt; 00:13:16,639<br>Now what about the square?</p>
<p>205<br>00:13:16,639 –&gt; 00:13:21,839<br>Remember the square had the two nested four loops, four, four, and then just a regular</p>
<p>206<br>00:13:21,839 –&gt; 00:13:23,639<br>addition in there.</p>
<p>207<br>00:13:23,639 –&gt; 00:13:25,039<br>So let’s run that.</p>
<p>208<br>00:13:25,039 –&gt; 00:13:28,679<br>All right, pretty fast, pretty fast.</p>
<p>209<br>00:13:28,679 –&gt; 00:13:34,759<br>The square of 1,000 is already taking 0.06 seconds.</p>
<p>210<br>00:13:34,759 –&gt; 00:13:40,679<br>Square of 10,000 is now taking 6 seconds.</p>
<p>211<br>00:13:40,679 –&gt; 00:13:44,759<br>What do we notice?</p>
<p>212<br>00:13:44,759 –&gt; 00:13:51,039<br>With one more round, if we waited for square of 100,000, we might be able to see a pattern.</p>
<p>213<br>00:13:51,039 –&gt; 00:13:52,879<br>Or we can guess the pattern.</p>
<p>214<br>00:13:52,879 –&gt; 00:13:55,879<br>Does anyone want to wager a guess what the next number should be here?</p>
<p>215<br>00:13:55,879 –&gt; 00:14:02,879<br>Let me think about it.</p>
<p>216<br>00:14:02,879 –&gt; 00:14:03,879<br>About 600.</p>
<p>217<br>00:14:03,879 –&gt; 00:14:05,439<br>Yeah, about 600, right?</p>
<p>218<br>00:14:05,439 –&gt; 00:14:08,759<br>We’re going from 0.06 to maybe about 600.</p>
<p>219<br>00:14:08,759 –&gt; 00:14:10,360<br>So I don’t know.</p>
<p>220<br>00:14:10,360 –&gt; 00:14:11,840<br>We could say about 600.</p>
<p>221<br>00:14:11,840 –&gt; 00:14:14,679<br>I’m certainly not going to wait for 600 seconds.</p>
<p>222<br>00:14:14,679 –&gt; 00:14:19,960<br>And I’m actually not going to make my computer do that, just in case it crashes.</p>
<p>223<br>00:14:19,960 –&gt; 00:14:24,679<br>But yeah, we could guess something like, you know, on the order of some hundreds, right?</p>
<p>224<br>00:14:25,079 –&gt; 00:14:28,079<br>600, something like that.</p>
<p>225<br>00:14:28,079 –&gt; 00:14:29,759<br>So that’s one thing to notice.</p>
<p>226<br>00:14:29,759 –&gt; 00:14:36,120<br>The other thing to notice is that already at 10,000, right, where the input is just 10,000,</p>
<p>227<br>00:14:36,120 –&gt; 00:14:39,399<br>this took five seconds already.</p>
<p>228<br>00:14:39,399 –&gt; 00:14:47,159<br>In the previous function here, my sum, we had to get to 100 million as my input to run</p>
<p>229<br>00:14:47,159 –&gt; 00:14:49,159<br>for five seconds.</p>
<p>230<br>00:14:49,159 –&gt; 00:14:51,159<br>Right, so that’s also a big difference here.</p>
<p>231<br>00:14:51,159 –&gt; 00:14:57,159<br>Actually this program square is taking a really long time to run when the input is not very</p>
<p>232<br>00:14:57,159 –&gt; 00:15:00,159<br>big.</p>
<p>233<br>00:15:00,159 –&gt; 00:15:02,159<br>All right.</p>
<p>234<br>00:15:02,159 –&gt; 00:15:05,639<br>So some things to notice about timing.</p>
<p>235<br>00:15:05,639 –&gt; 00:15:08,240<br>And as I said, we’re going to look at some more programs next lecture.</p>
<p>236<br>00:15:08,240 –&gt; 00:15:12,639<br>I just wanted to give you a general sense of timing programs.</p>
<p>237<br>00:15:12,639 –&gt; 00:15:15,919<br>First of all, the green check is good.</p>
<p>238<br>00:15:15,919 –&gt; 00:15:17,919<br>We want all these to be green checks.</p>
<p>239<br>00:15:17,919 –&gt; 00:15:21,120<br>The green check is good because if we have different algorithms, they’re going to be</p>
<p>240<br>00:15:21,120 –&gt; 00:15:22,679<br>going to take a different amount of time, right?</p>
<p>241<br>00:15:22,679 –&gt; 00:15:28,279<br>That time that it takes for these algorithms to run will be different, which is good.</p>
<p>242<br>00:15:28,279 –&gt; 00:15:33,440<br>But if we have different implementations for the same sort of program, for the same algorithm,</p>
<p>243<br>00:15:33,440 –&gt; 00:15:35,960<br>that’s also going to give us different timings.</p>
<p>244<br>00:15:35,960 –&gt; 00:15:38,919<br>And really in the long run, I don’t really care about that.</p>
<p>245<br>00:15:38,919 –&gt; 00:15:43,200<br>What I would really like to evaluate is just the algorithm itself.</p>
<p>246<br>00:15:43,200 –&gt; 00:15:48,080<br>Because when we’re talking about algorithms, it’s probably only a handful of algorithms</p>
<p>247<br>00:15:48,080 –&gt; 00:15:51,920<br>out there in the world that we can apply to a given problem.</p>
<p>248<br>00:15:51,920 –&gt; 00:15:56,360<br>Whereas there’s probably thousands of different implementations we can apply to a problem.</p>
<p>249<br>00:15:56,360 –&gt; 00:15:59,720<br>So for example, you could have a for loop versus a while loop.</p>
<p>250<br>00:15:59,720 –&gt; 00:16:05,200<br>You could have creating intermediate variables as an implementation or you could have a list</p>
<p>251<br>00:16:05,200 –&gt; 00:16:07,960<br>comprehension version of an implementation.</p>
<p>252<br>00:16:07,960 –&gt; 00:16:13,120<br>But underlying all that is going to be just some algorithm that you’re trying to implement.</p>
<p>253<br>00:16:13,120 –&gt; 00:16:14,120<br>Okay.</p>
<p>254<br>00:16:14,519 –&gt; 00:16:17,919<br>The running time will vary between different implementations, which is not really something</p>
<p>255<br>00:16:17,919 –&gt; 00:16:19,320<br>I want.</p>
<p>256<br>00:16:19,320 –&gt; 00:16:21,679<br>The running time will also vary between computers.</p>
<p>257<br>00:16:21,679 –&gt; 00:16:27,720<br>If I ran the same programs on an older computer, it’s probably not going to take five seconds,</p>
<p>258<br>00:16:27,720 –&gt; 00:16:29,759<br>to run with an input of 100 million.</p>
<p>259<br>00:16:29,759 –&gt; 00:16:32,000<br>It might take 10 or it might take 11.</p>
<p>260<br>00:16:32,000 –&gt; 00:16:35,399<br>So the timing is also going to differ between different computers.</p>
<p>261<br>00:16:35,399 –&gt; 00:16:38,560<br>It will also differ between different languages.</p>
<p>262<br>00:16:38,559 –&gt; 00:16:44,239<br>So Java versus Python versus C is very efficient at memory.</p>
<p>263<br>00:16:44,239 –&gt; 00:16:46,039<br>Management, it’s going to run very fast.</p>
<p>264<br>00:16:46,039 –&gt; 00:16:49,639<br>Whereas if Python’s a little bit slower, it’s going to run slower.</p>
<p>265<br>00:16:49,639 –&gt; 00:16:56,359<br>So again, we’re actually capturing, the timing is capturing implementations between languages.</p>
<p>266<br>00:16:56,359 –&gt; 00:16:59,559<br>And the timing is not very predictable for small inputs.</p>
<p>267<br>00:16:59,559 –&gt; 00:17:06,639<br>So if for some reason, when I was running the square function here with one, I was also</p>
<p>268<br>00:17:06,640 –&gt; 00:17:11,040<br>running Netflix in the background, where my computer decided to update something and</p>
<p>269<br>00:17:11,040 –&gt; 00:17:15,640<br>decided to just dedicate resources to doing that task at that moment when I’m trying</p>
<p>270<br>00:17:15,640 –&gt; 00:17:17,920<br>to run the square of one.</p>
<p>271<br>00:17:17,920 –&gt; 00:17:21,720<br>This 0.0 seconds might not be 0.0 seconds.</p>
<p>272<br>00:17:21,720 –&gt; 00:17:27,080<br>It might take away from the time it takes, the time it allocates to running my square</p>
<p>273<br>00:17:27,080 –&gt; 00:17:28,400<br>program.</p>
<p>274<br>00:17:28,400 –&gt; 00:17:33,320<br>And then what we’ll see is that this will no longer be 0.0, it might be 0.1 or something</p>
<p>275<br>00:17:33,320 –&gt; 00:17:34,920<br>like that.</p>
<p>276<br>00:17:34,920 –&gt; 00:17:38,960<br>So timing programs is not very good.</p>
<p>277<br>00:17:38,960 –&gt; 00:17:44,560<br>It’s not very consistent with our goal here, which is to evaluate algorithms.</p>
<p>278<br>00:17:44,560 –&gt; 00:17:50,640<br>All right, let’s see if we can do better with the idea of counting the number of operations.</p>
<p>279<br>00:17:50,640 –&gt; 00:18:00,600<br>So rather than focusing on describing our program in terms of human time, 1 second, 0.5 seconds,</p>
<p>280<br>00:18:00,600 –&gt; 00:18:04,880<br>things like that, let’s come up with some operations in Python.</p>
<p>281<br>00:18:04,880 –&gt; 00:18:09,080<br>That’s take one time unit, right?</p>
<p>282<br>00:18:09,080 –&gt; 00:18:13,520<br>And we’re going to say that all of these really basic operations, we can say that they take</p>
<p>283<br>00:18:13,520 –&gt; 00:18:14,680<br>the same amount of time.</p>
<p>284<br>00:18:14,680 –&gt; 00:18:19,600<br>I don’t care if they’re like 10 to the negative 9 seconds or 2 times 10 to the negative 9</p>
<p>285<br>00:18:19,600 –&gt; 00:18:20,600<br>seconds.</p>
<p>286<br>00:18:20,600 –&gt; 00:18:21,600<br>I don’t care about that.</p>
<p>287<br>00:18:21,600 –&gt; 00:18:23,400<br>I just know that they’re really fast.</p>
<p>288<br>00:18:23,400 –&gt; 00:18:26,960<br>And if they’re really fast, I can say that each of them just take one unit of time.</p>
<p>289<br>00:18:26,960 –&gt; 00:18:30,440<br>So I’ll just count them all as one unit of time.</p>
<p>290<br>00:18:30,440 –&gt; 00:18:33,680<br>So the examples of those are mathematical operations, right?</p>
<p>291<br>00:18:33,680 –&gt; 00:18:34,680<br>They’re pretty fast.</p>
<p>292<br>00:18:34,680 –&gt; 00:18:38,240<br>So no matter whether I’m multiplying, dividing, adding, subtracting, taking something to the</p>
<p>293<br>00:18:38,240 –&gt; 00:18:42,680<br>power of something else, I’m going to say that each one of those takes one unit of time,</p>
<p>294<br>00:18:42,680 –&gt; 00:18:43,680<br>right?</p>
<p>295<br>00:18:43,680 –&gt; 00:18:49,880<br>Comparing something, so a less than b, 3 greater than 4, things like that, equality, also super</p>
<p>296<br>00:18:49,880 –&gt; 00:18:55,360<br>fast to do, also takes one unit of time, assigning something, so a is equal to 3.</p>
<p>297<br>00:18:55,360 –&gt; 00:19:00,480<br>That assignment statement right there, also pretty fast to do, takes one unit of time,</p>
<p>298<br>00:19:00,480 –&gt; 00:19:02,960<br>and then accessing objects in memory, right?</p>
<p>299<br>00:19:02,960 –&gt; 00:19:07,519<br>So pretty fast takes one unit of time.</p>
<p>300<br>00:19:07,519 –&gt; 00:19:13,440<br>So with this new definition of time, quote unquote, right, where we have these units of time,</p>
<p>301<br>00:19:13,440 –&gt; 00:19:19,480<br>let’s figure out how long these functions actually take.</p>
<p>302<br>00:19:19,480 –&gt; 00:19:25,360<br>So our Celsius to Fahrenheit function has three operations in it, right?</p>
<p>303<br>00:19:25,360 –&gt; 00:19:28,440<br>I got a multiplication, a division, and an addition.</p>
<p>304<br>00:19:28,440 –&gt; 00:19:32,400<br>I don’t care, it’s sort of the little variations that each one of these take to actually do</p>
<p>305<br>00:19:32,400 –&gt; 00:19:37,160<br>inside computer memory, I’m going to say that the Celsius to Fahrenheit program takes three</p>
<p>306<br>00:19:37,160 –&gt; 00:19:40,640<br>units of time, okay?</p>
<p>307<br>00:19:40,640 –&gt; 00:19:47,360<br>So no matter what the input is, if I’m converting zero Celsius or a million Celsius, the program</p>
<p>308<br>00:19:47,360 –&gt; 00:19:52,279<br>will still just take three units of time to complete.</p>
<p>309<br>00:19:52,279 –&gt; 00:19:54,960<br>How about my sum?</p>
<p>310<br>00:19:54,960 –&gt; 00:19:56,960<br>So we’ll go through step by step.</p>
<p>311<br>00:19:56,960 –&gt; 00:20:04,240<br>So in my sum, I’ve got one assignment statement here, so that’s going to be one operation.</p>
<p>312<br>00:20:04,240 –&gt; 00:20:09,920<br>The for loop here is going to take i and assign it to one of the values in the range, right?</p>
<p>313<br>00:20:09,920 –&gt; 00:20:13,200<br>That’s just internally what it does, so that’s going to be one operation each time through</p>
<p>314<br>00:20:13,200 –&gt; 00:20:15,319<br>the loop.</p>
<p>315<br>00:20:15,319 –&gt; 00:20:25,160<br>And then total plus equals i is going to be two operations because I have total plus i</p>
<p>316<br>00:20:25,160 –&gt; 00:20:31,400<br>on the right hand side, that’s one operation, and then assigning that back to total is my</p>
<p>317<br>00:20:31,400 –&gt; 00:20:34,880<br>second operation, okay?</p>
<p>318<br>00:20:34,880 –&gt; 00:20:39,200<br>So that’s two operations there, and that’s it.</p>
<p>319<br>00:20:39,200 –&gt; 00:20:46,320<br>But notice our for loop, these three operations here, the one for assigning i to be a value</p>
<p>320<br>00:20:46,320 –&gt; 00:20:52,240<br>here, and these two operations here repeat x plus one times, right?</p>
<p>321<br>00:20:52,240 –&gt; 00:21:02,240<br>So how long does this program actually take?</p>
<p>322<br>00:21:02,240 –&gt; 00:21:08,000<br>Well, we count all that up, so the one for the total equals zero plus, and we’re multiplying</p>
<p>323<br>00:21:08,000 –&gt; 00:21:10,440<br>x plus one times what?</p>
<p>324<br>00:21:10,440 –&gt; 00:21:15,079<br>The one plus the two, which gives us three x plus four total operations.</p>
<p>325<br>00:21:15,079 –&gt; 00:21:20,759<br>So now we’re noting this in terms of the input, which is kind of cool, right?</p>
<p>326<br>00:21:20,759 –&gt; 00:21:25,839<br>So now I have this nice little formula where if I know my input is ten, I can actually tell</p>
<p>327<br>00:21:25,839 –&gt; 00:21:30,680<br>you how many units of time this program will take.</p>
<p>328<br>00:21:30,680 –&gt; 00:21:33,000<br>All right, how about the square?</p>
<p>329<br>00:21:33,000 –&gt; 00:21:37,359<br>It’s going to be very similar, so I’ve got one operation for assignment here.</p>
<p>330<br>00:21:37,359 –&gt; 00:21:43,079<br>This is one operation for grabbing the i and making it one of the values in the range.</p>
<p>331<br>00:21:43,079 –&gt; 00:21:47,519<br>Similarly for the inner loop, one operation there, and then square sum plus equals one for</p>
<p>332<br>00:21:47,559 –&gt; 00:21:51,400<br>the same reason as this is two operations, right?</p>
<p>333<br>00:21:51,400 –&gt; 00:21:57,000<br>One for the right-hand side, doing the addition, and two for making the assignment.</p>
<p>334<br>00:21:57,000 –&gt; 00:21:58,599<br>Let’s not forget our four loops, right?</p>
<p>335<br>00:21:58,599 –&gt; 00:22:04,680<br>We’ve got two four loops here, so the inner one will repeat n times, and for each one of</p>
<p>336<br>00:22:04,680 –&gt; 00:22:08,839<br>those outer n times, we do the inner n times.</p>
<p>337<br>00:22:08,839 –&gt; 00:22:13,119<br>Right, this nested four loop situation here.</p>
<p>338<br>00:22:13,119 –&gt; 00:22:19,159<br>So the total number of time units that this square will take is the one over here for</p>
<p>339<br>00:22:19,159 –&gt; 00:22:23,879<br>this square sum equals zero plus, and then I’ve got these nested four loops, so the other</p>
<p>340<br>00:22:23,879 –&gt; 00:22:32,079<br>one goes through n times, sorry, n times, the one operation multiplied by the inner four</p>
<p>341<br>00:22:32,079 –&gt; 00:22:36,799<br>loop also n times times what is the operations done in the inner four loop?</p>
<p>342<br>00:22:36,799 –&gt; 00:22:41,519<br>Well, it’s this one plus these two, so the one plus the two.</p>
<p>343<br>00:22:41,519 –&gt; 00:22:50,879<br>So in total, three n squared plus one operations.</p>
<p>344<br>00:22:50,879 –&gt; 00:22:57,319<br>So let’s run this, and now that we’re counting operations, we should be able to see a</p>
<p>345<br>00:22:57,319 –&gt; 00:22:59,960<br>more of a better pattern.</p>
<p>346<br>00:22:59,960 –&gt; 00:23:06,000<br>So here’s my Celsius to Fahrenheit, my sum and square slightly changed because I’ve got</p>
<p>347<br>00:23:06,000 –&gt; 00:23:12,240<br>this little counter variable within each function that is going to increment each time I see</p>
<p>348<br>00:23:12,240 –&gt; 00:23:13,240<br>an operation.</p>
<p>349<br>00:23:13,240 –&gt; 00:23:17,859<br>So obviously, for Celsius to Fahrenheit, it’s always three, right?</p>
<p>350<br>00:23:17,859 –&gt; 00:23:21,980<br>So when I do my return, I’m just going to return the counter variable, and then the regular</p>
<p>351<br>00:23:21,980 –&gt; 00:23:26,319<br>thing that this function should return as a two-ball.</p>
<p>352<br>00:23:26,319 –&gt; 00:23:32,400<br>For my sum, this counter equals one stands for this assignment statement, and then each</p>
<p>353<br>00:23:32,400 –&gt; 00:23:38,240<br>time through the loop, I’m going to increment my counter for the three operations, right?</p>
<p>354<br>00:23:38,240 –&gt; 00:23:43,320<br>Assigning the i to be one of the values in the range, and then two more for this total</p>
<p>355<br>00:23:43,320 –&gt; 00:23:44,800<br>plus equals i.</p>
<p>356<br>00:23:44,800 –&gt; 00:23:50,000<br>So that’s going to get incremented each time through the loop, and then the square similarly.</p>
<p>357<br>00:23:50,000 –&gt; 00:23:55,400<br>So here’s my counter equals one for this statement here, counter plus equals one for grabbing</p>
<p>358<br>00:23:55,400 –&gt; 00:24:00,560<br>the i as one of these values, and then counter plus equals three for grabbing the j to be</p>
<p>359<br>00:24:00,559 –&gt; 00:24:05,879<br>one of these values and incrementing this my sum.</p>
<p>360<br>00:24:05,879 –&gt; 00:24:11,000<br>So because of where I place these counters, Python would automatically count it all up,</p>
<p>361<br>00:24:11,000 –&gt; 00:24:13,720<br>for no matter how many loops I’ve got.</p>
<p>362<br>00:24:13,720 –&gt; 00:24:19,639<br>So here’s my wrapper for counting slightly different than the timing one, because now I’m actually</p>
<p>363<br>00:24:19,639 –&gt; 00:24:25,960<br>going to also keep track of how much, how many more operations I’ve done compared to the</p>
<p>364<br>00:24:25,960 –&gt; 00:24:29,440<br>previous input.</p>
<p>365<br>00:24:29,440 –&gt; 00:24:31,200<br>So let me show you what that means.</p>
<p>366<br>00:24:31,200 –&gt; 00:24:35,759<br>Let’s run Celsius to Fahrenheit with the following inputs.</p>
<p>367<br>00:24:35,759 –&gt; 00:24:40,519<br>So I’m, first of all, reporting the total number of operations, just like it did with timing,</p>
<p>368<br>00:24:40,519 –&gt; 00:24:45,360<br>so always three operations, no surprise there, that’s what we coded up basically.</p>
<p>369<br>00:24:45,360 –&gt; 00:24:49,920<br>But then I’m also reporting here, and that’s done inside the wrapper function, the count</p>
<p>370<br>00:24:49,920 –&gt; 00:24:54,960<br>wrapper, how many more operations is this based on the previous one?</p>
<p>371<br>00:24:54,960 –&gt; 00:25:00,759<br>So the first one’s a little weird, but when my input is 10 times more, I went from 100</p>
<p>372<br>00:25:00,759 –&gt; 00:25:04,920<br>to 1000, I’ve done one more operation.</p>
<p>373<br>00:25:04,920 –&gt; 00:25:05,920<br>No change obviously, right?</p>
<p>374<br>00:25:05,920 –&gt; 00:25:10,559<br>Because it’s always three operations done in total.</p>
<p>375<br>00:25:10,559 –&gt; 00:25:13,600<br>So just for patient sake, right?</p>
<p>376<br>00:25:13,600 –&gt; 00:25:14,759<br>This is the slide.</p>
<p>377<br>00:25:14,759 –&gt; 00:25:20,440<br>So no matter what happens to the input here, the number of operations in these sort of</p>
<p>378<br>00:25:20,440 –&gt; 00:25:26,640<br>units of time, which we’re just counting the number of operations is three.</p>
<p>379<br>00:25:26,640 –&gt; 00:25:28,320<br>What about the sum?</p>
<p>380<br>00:25:28,320 –&gt; 00:25:31,400<br>So remember the sum had that for loop in it.</p>
<p>381<br>00:25:31,400 –&gt; 00:25:35,840<br>Let’s run that and see how many operations are here.</p>
<p>382<br>00:25:35,840 –&gt; 00:25:39,559<br>So first I’m going to report the number of operations.</p>
<p>383<br>00:25:39,559 –&gt; 00:25:44,519<br>So when the input is 100, it’s 304, when the input is 1000, it’s 3000, 4, when the input</p>
<p>384<br>00:25:44,519 –&gt; 00:25:47,000<br>is 10,000, it’s 30,000, 4.</p>
<p>385<br>00:25:47,000 –&gt; 00:25:49,359<br>So that matches up the formula we came up with, right?</p>
<p>386<br>00:25:49,359 –&gt; 00:25:52,359<br>3x plus 4, that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>387<br>00:25:52,359 –&gt; 00:25:58,559<br>And then you can see now here, I’m reporting how many more operations is this line based</p>
<p>388<br>00:25:58,559 –&gt; 00:26:00,440<br>on the previous line.</p>
<p>389<br>00:26:00,440 –&gt; 00:26:02,519<br>So it’s about 9.8 times more, right?</p>
<p>390<br>00:26:02,519 –&gt; 00:26:09,200<br>So when my input increases by 10 from 100 to 1000, I am doing approximately 9.88 times</p>
<p>391<br>00:26:09,200 –&gt; 00:26:11,440<br>more operations.</p>
<p>392<br>00:26:11,440 –&gt; 00:26:21,840<br>And my input increases from 1000 to 10,000, again by 10, I’m doing 9.988 times more operations.</p>
<p>393<br>00:26:21,840 –&gt; 00:26:26,840<br>So we see sort of like a nice little steady state going on here, right?</p>
<p>394<br>00:26:26,840 –&gt; 00:26:32,600<br>Where when my input gets really, really big, it looks like I’m approaching approximately</p>
<p>395<br>00:26:32,600 –&gt; 00:26:35,200<br>10 times as many operations, right?</p>
<p>396<br>00:26:35,200 –&gt; 00:26:38,200<br>When my input is 10 times more.</p>
<p>397<br>00:26:38,200 –&gt; 00:26:43,160<br>This is obviously more apparent when the input is big because the tiny variations in my</p>
<p>398<br>00:26:43,160 –&gt; 00:26:44,160<br>formula, right?</p>
<p>399<br>00:26:44,160 –&gt; 00:26:51,759<br>The plus 4, specifically, makes less of an impact when my input is really large.</p>
<p>400<br>00:26:51,759 –&gt; 00:26:54,600<br>And this is kind of going in line with our motivation.</p>
<p>401<br>00:26:54,600 –&gt; 00:26:58,920<br>When the input data is really, really big, what I’d like to report is sort of the algorithm</p>
<p>402<br>00:26:58,920 –&gt; 00:27:00,600<br>and how long it takes.</p>
<p>403<br>00:27:00,599 –&gt; 00:27:10,799<br>I don’t care that the algorithm takes 3x plus 4 or 3x times 3x as operations, right?</p>
<p>404<br>00:27:10,799 –&gt; 00:27:15,439<br>When the input is really big, all I care is that it’s sort of on the order of x, right?</p>
<p>405<br>00:27:15,439 –&gt; 00:27:18,599<br>That’s something we’ll get at next lecture.</p>
<p>406<br>00:27:18,599 –&gt; 00:27:20,359<br>But this is the big idea here.</p>
<p>407<br>00:27:20,359 –&gt; 00:27:26,759<br>When the input increases by 10, it seems like at steady state, our number of operations</p>
<p>408<br>00:27:26,759 –&gt; 00:27:28,199<br>increases by 10 as well.</p>
<p>409<br>00:27:28,200 –&gt; 00:27:31,200<br>So it’s sort of this linear relationship.</p>
<p>410<br>00:27:31,200 –&gt; 00:27:38,680<br>All right, what about the last function, the square?</p>
<p>411<br>00:27:38,680 –&gt; 00:27:41,279<br>So I’m doing something a little special here.</p>
<p>412<br>00:27:41,279 –&gt; 00:27:45,000<br>I have two different inputs I’m going to run the square with.</p>
<p>413<br>00:27:45,000 –&gt; 00:27:48,840<br>So the first one is L2A.</p>
<p>414<br>00:27:48,840 –&gt; 00:27:53,759<br>So I’m going to run square with input 128, 256, 512, 1024.</p>
<p>415<br>00:27:53,759 –&gt; 00:27:57,599<br>So I’m basically increasing my input by 2, right?</p>
<p>416<br>00:27:57,599 –&gt; 00:28:03,000<br>I’m multiplying my input by 2 each time.</p>
<p>417<br>00:28:03,000 –&gt; 00:28:09,480<br>And then I’m going to run it with L2B where my input increases by 10 each time.</p>
<p>418<br>00:28:09,480 –&gt; 00:28:13,720<br>So we’re going to see if we can figure out a relationship between these for the square.</p>
<p>419<br>00:28:13,720 –&gt; 00:28:17,720<br>Because that one was a little hard to figure out in just pure timing without actually waiting</p>
<p>420<br>00:28:17,720 –&gt; 00:28:23,519<br>for minutes or days or.</p>
<p>421<br>00:28:23,519 –&gt; 00:28:26,200<br>Okay, so we got something to work with here.</p>
<p>422<br>00:28:26,200 –&gt; 00:28:27,559<br>So here I’ve got my square.</p>
<p>423<br>00:28:27,559 –&gt; 00:28:35,559<br>So this first bit here is when my input increased by 2 and down here just finished is when my input</p>
<p>424<br>00:28:35,559 –&gt; 00:28:38,279<br>increases by 10.</p>
<p>425<br>00:28:38,279 –&gt; 00:28:46,000<br>So number of operations when my input increases by 2 are not so important.</p>
<p>426<br>00:28:46,000 –&gt; 00:28:47,720<br>Yes, they’re big.</p>
<p>427<br>00:28:47,720 –&gt; 00:28:52,559<br>But what I’m really interested in, just like what we saw in the miceome example, is what</p>
<p>428<br>00:28:52,559 –&gt; 00:28:55,799<br>happens to the steady state as the input gets really big, right?</p>
<p>429<br>00:28:55,799 –&gt; 00:28:59,240<br>How many more operations are we doing?</p>
<p>430<br>00:28:59,240 –&gt; 00:29:04,039<br>And what we can see is that the number of operations as the input gets really big is</p>
<p>431<br>00:29:04,039 –&gt; 00:29:07,799<br>approximately 10 times, sorry, four times more.</p>
<p>432<br>00:29:07,799 –&gt; 00:29:15,399<br>In the case where I increase my input by 2 every round.</p>
<p>433<br>00:29:15,400 –&gt; 00:29:24,440<br>So when I increase my input by 2, the number of operations are going to be four times more.</p>
<p>434<br>00:29:24,440 –&gt; 00:29:27,200<br>Well what about when I increase my input by 10, right?</p>
<p>435<br>00:29:27,200 –&gt; 00:29:29,720<br>1, 10, 100, a thousand, so on.</p>
<p>436<br>00:29:29,720 –&gt; 00:29:34,360<br>Again, I’m not so much interested in number of operations, but what happens to the steady</p>
<p>437<br>00:29:34,360 –&gt; 00:29:35,440<br>state?</p>
<p>438<br>00:29:35,440 –&gt; 00:29:38,080<br>With very few operations, it’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>439<br>00:29:38,080 –&gt; 00:29:43,680<br>But as we increase it, we see that it goes towards approximately 100, right?</p>
<p>440<br>00:29:43,680 –&gt; 00:29:50,240<br>So when my input increases by 10, that takes me to about 100 fold increase in the number</p>
<p>441<br>00:29:50,240 –&gt; 00:29:53,600<br>of operations.</p>
<p>442<br>00:29:53,600 –&gt; 00:29:58,720<br>So now can you guys see the relationship between the input for the square and the number</p>
<p>443<br>00:29:58,720 –&gt; 00:30:00,039<br>of operations?</p>
<p>444<br>00:30:00,039 –&gt; 00:30:01,840<br>You can, right?</p>
<p>445<br>00:30:01,840 –&gt; 00:30:06,240<br>So it’s approximately sort of an n squared relationship, right?</p>
<p>446<br>00:30:06,240 –&gt; 00:30:12,720<br>When my input increases by, you know, when my input is n, the number of operations is going</p>
<p>447<br>00:30:12,720 –&gt; 00:30:19,160<br>to be on the order of n squared more.</p>
<p>448<br>00:30:19,160 –&gt; 00:30:23,759<br>So counting operations is actually a lot better than timing, as we can see, right?</p>
<p>449<br>00:30:23,759 –&gt; 00:30:26,920<br>We’ve eliminated a bunch of those red X’s, right?</p>
<p>450<br>00:30:26,920 –&gt; 00:30:33,720<br>We no longer, we no longer have to deal with variations between computers because before</p>
<p>451<br>00:30:33,720 –&gt; 00:30:37,400<br>counting this on the computer that’s slower fast, we’re still counting the same amount</p>
<p>452<br>00:30:37,400 –&gt; 00:30:39,319<br>of stuff.</p>
<p>453<br>00:30:39,319 –&gt; 00:30:44,240<br>So again, it’s not going to matter because you’ll implement it in a similar way.</p>
<p>454<br>00:30:44,240 –&gt; 00:30:46,919<br>Small inputs is still sort of iffy, right?</p>
<p>455<br>00:30:46,919 –&gt; 00:30:51,039<br>We saw the square was a little bit unpredictable when the input was pretty small, right down</p>
<p>456<br>00:30:51,039 –&gt; 00:30:54,879<br>here, you know, 60, then straight up to 90.</p>
<p>457<br>00:30:54,879 –&gt; 00:30:57,720<br>But we didn’t take long to see the steady state.</p>
<p>458<br>00:30:57,720 –&gt; 00:31:00,240<br>So it’s actually better than before, better than timing.</p>
<p>459<br>00:31:00,240 –&gt; 00:31:02,639<br>It’s not zero at least.</p>
<p>460<br>00:31:02,639 –&gt; 00:31:07,919<br>But now the problem becomes sort of what’s the definition of which operations to count?</p>
<p>461<br>00:31:07,920 –&gt; 00:31:11,039<br>Because our functions have a return value.</p>
<p>462<br>00:31:11,039 –&gt; 00:31:13,960<br>Do we count the return as an operation?</p>
<p>463<br>00:31:13,960 –&gt; 00:31:14,960<br>Technically you should, right?</p>
<p>464<br>00:31:14,960 –&gt; 00:31:18,160<br>That’s a value that’s being passed between functions, so that’s going to take some time</p>
<p>465<br>00:31:18,160 –&gt; 00:31:19,880<br>to run.</p>
<p>466<br>00:31:19,880 –&gt; 00:31:22,480<br>But we didn’t actually count it in our example, right?</p>
<p>467<br>00:31:22,480 –&gt; 00:31:24,840<br>But you could if you wanted to.</p>
<p>468<br>00:31:24,840 –&gt; 00:31:27,560<br>So that’s where we stand, right?</p>
<p>469<br>00:31:27,560 –&gt; 00:31:34,400<br>We’ve got timing and counting, just as an initial example.</p>
<p>470<br>00:31:34,400 –&gt; 00:31:37,880<br>Next lecture, we’re going to look at a few more examples with lists and things like</p>
<p>471<br>00:31:37,880 –&gt; 00:31:42,200<br>that, just again timing and counting those functions.</p>
<p>472<br>00:31:42,200 –&gt; 00:31:46,720<br>But again, the big idea here is that we’re trying to get at evaluating just a handful</p>
