                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:20,519<br>So let’s start today’s lecture.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:20,519 –&gt; 00:00:24,839<br>Today we’re going to be talking about the idea of iteration and iteration is another way</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:24,839 –&gt; 00:00:31,719<br>we’re going to add control flow to our programs. But before we do that, let’s do a little bit</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:31,719 –&gt; 00:00:38,560<br>of a recap on, sorry, let’s do a little bit of a recap of what we’ve done so far last lecture</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:38,560 –&gt; 00:00:44,719<br>because last lecture we actually introduced a different mechanism for control flow, branching.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:44,719 –&gt; 00:00:49,280<br>And the control flow was basically a way for us to tell Python not to go systematically</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:49,280 –&gt; 00:00:54,519<br>through the code. Branching was a way for us to tell Python, hey, based on some condition</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:54,520 –&gt; 00:01:00,040<br>being true or false, either evaluate some set of code or another set of code, right,</p>
<p>9<br>00:01:00,040 –&gt; 00:01:05,079<br>which was not going linearly, we were actually kind of skipping around through the code.</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:05,079 –&gt; 00:01:09,640<br>So that’s what we learned at the end of the lecture, but we also learned about input and</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:09,640 –&gt; 00:01:14,520<br>output, so a way for us to write interactive programs. And we learned about a new data</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:14,520 –&gt; 00:01:19,280<br>type, the string. So the string was a sequence of characters. Hopefully you got a chance</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:19,280 –&gt; 00:01:26,599<br>to do a little bit of exercises on MITX as practice for today’s quiz with quizzes with strings</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:26,599 –&gt; 00:01:33,599<br>and branching. Okay, so in branching, what did we learn? We talked about how to actually</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:33,599 –&gt; 00:01:38,760<br>add a branching point in our program. So we did that using these particular keywords.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:38,760 –&gt; 00:01:42,200<br>So when you type them in your program in the file editor, you’ll see that they kind of turn</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:42,200 –&gt; 00:01:47,200<br>a different color that tells you it’s a special word in Python. And these keywords are how</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:47,200 –&gt; 00:01:56,520<br>we told Python to put a branching point. And the colon kind of ended the branching conditional.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:56,520 –&gt; 00:02:03,159<br>And then anything that was indented as part of that conditional was code that would be executed</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:03,159 –&gt; 00:02:07,760<br>when that condition was true. So I’m just going to quickly go over these, each one of these boxes.</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:07,760 –&gt; 00:02:12,960<br>So the first one up here was the simplest way that we could add a conditional to our program.</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:13,439 –&gt; 00:02:18,480<br>It basically said, hey, go through the program. When you reach this if condition, Python would</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:18,480 –&gt; 00:02:24,960<br>check the condition and say, if that condition is true, execute the code that’s indented</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:24,960 –&gt; 00:02:29,760<br>as part of that block. If the condition was not true, don’t do anything, just carry on with</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:29,760 –&gt; 00:02:35,560<br>a remaining program. If we wanted to do something else, so if the condition was not true, we</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:35,560 –&gt; 00:02:41,680<br>wanted to do something else. We added this else clause here. And the else also has some sort</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:41,680 –&gt; 00:02:48,400<br>of code indented as part of its code block. And that code would be executed when that condition was false.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:50,800 –&gt; 00:02:56,480<br>Okay, so that was a really simple if or if else code structure. But sometimes we want to have code</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:56,480 –&gt; 00:03:02,240<br>that checks for many conditions, right? Not just one. That’s where the L if structure came in. So we</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:02,240 –&gt; 00:03:08,719<br>would have an if condition that starts our code block. If that condition was true, as usual,</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:08,719 –&gt; 00:03:14,879<br>we execute the code that’s part of that block. Else, if so L if, we could insert another condition.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:15,439 –&gt; 00:03:19,280<br>And Python would say, okay, well, if that one wasn’t true, let me check if this next one is true.</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:19,280 –&gt; 00:03:23,520<br>And then we would execute the code that’s part of that code block. And we can add, we can chain</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:23,520 –&gt; 00:03:30,479<br>as many of these ellips as we want together. And Python will evaluate the very first one that</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:30,479 –&gt; 00:03:37,199<br>it finds true that’s part of this chain. Okay, even if more than one is true. It is possible</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:37,199 –&gt; 00:03:42,239<br>none of those conditions were true in which case Python would basically skip over all of them and</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:42,239 –&gt; 00:03:47,759<br>do nothing and turn none of those code blocks. If you wanted to have a structure where if none of</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:47,759 –&gt; 00:03:53,439<br>those conditions were true, you wanted to do something. You could put an else at the end of a whole</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:53,439 –&gt; 00:03:59,599<br>chain of if L if ellips. And the else would be executed when none of those conditions are true.</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:00,159 –&gt; 00:04:06,560<br>Okay, so hopefully this is just recap. One sort of tricky thing to remember is the ifs.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:07,359 –&gt; 00:04:13,679<br>Starts a code block. So the if can have an else associated with it or it can have an L if ellip and</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:13,679 –&gt; 00:04:20,399<br>an else associated with it. But if you have if condition and then followed by another if condition,</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:20,399 –&gt; 00:04:24,719<br>both of those code blocks could potentially be executed because the ifs are independent, right?</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:24,719 –&gt; 00:04:30,719<br>It’s not an else situation. They’re just another if code block that that gets started.</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:32,079 –&gt; 00:04:36,480<br>So the way we told Python, again, just to reiterate the way you told Python, which code to execute</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:36,480 –&gt; 00:04:40,960<br>when the condition is true is by indentation. And indentation is something you have to do.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:42,000 –&gt; 00:04:48,319<br>It’s not optional in Python. Okay, so let’s take what we’ve learned so far and code up a really</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:48,319 –&gt; 00:04:53,680<br>simple game. So this is sort of a very simple variation of the lost woods in Zelda, sort of my</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:53,680 –&gt; 00:04:58,720<br>version of it. Let’s say it’s kind of a trick level where you have your character and they enter</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:58,720 –&gt; 00:05:04,960<br>the lost woods. They’re presented with this screen. And the trick here is you ask the user if they</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:04,959 –&gt; 00:05:10,159<br>want to go left or right. If they say right, you’re basically going to present them with the exact</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:10,159 –&gt; 00:05:15,919<br>same screen all over again. So it’s kind of representing their loss in the woods. And as long as they</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:15,919 –&gt; 00:05:19,359<br>say I want to keep going right, I want to keep going right, I want to keep going right, they’re</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:19,359 –&gt; 00:05:23,839<br>basically going to see the same screen over and over again. And the trick to getting out of the</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:23,839 –&gt; 00:05:31,599<br>woods is to say I want to go left. Okay, so no matter how far, how many times they said right in a</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:31,600 –&gt; 00:05:38,080<br>row, as long as they type in left, they’re out of the woods. Okay, so let’s try to code that up with</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:38,080 –&gt; 00:05:47,200<br>what we know, just conditionals. We have an if else, right? The if says if the user exits right,</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:47,200 –&gt; 00:05:53,040<br>we’re going to do something. And otherwise, we’re going to say that the user said left or something</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:53,040 –&gt; 00:05:58,080<br>else or exit. And we’re going to tell them that they’ve exited successfully. All right, now if they</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:58,079 –&gt; 00:06:02,240<br>said exit right, what do we do? Well, we’re going to show them the exact same thing again. So we’re</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:02,240 –&gt; 00:06:07,279<br>setting the background to the same woods background. And then to present it with a choice all over again,</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:07,279 –&gt; 00:06:12,639<br>right? Do you want exit right or you want exit left? So if they say exit right, we would do something.</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:13,839 –&gt; 00:06:19,439<br>And otherwise, we would tell them they were they successfully exited. Okay, well, what if they</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:19,439 –&gt; 00:06:24,159<br>exited right? If they exited right, then we would do something again, basically present them with</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:24,160 –&gt; 00:06:30,640<br>the same situation. So we would set the woods background again, and we would ask them if they</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:30,640 –&gt; 00:06:37,040<br>want to go right or left again. And otherwise, if they said left, they exit. So we already see a problem,</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:37,040 –&gt; 00:06:43,040<br>right? How deep do we make this nested loop situation, right? Here, we already have three. In case the</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:43,040 –&gt; 00:06:48,480<br>user said I want to go right three times in a row. But we don’t know how persistent the user will be.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:48,480 –&gt; 00:06:54,400<br>So how do we know when we’re writing our code, how deep to make this nested loop? We don’t.</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:55,120 –&gt; 00:06:59,920<br>Right? We won’t be able to really code this up very well with what we know so far. So that’s kind</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:59,920 –&gt; 00:07:05,680<br>of the motivation for introducing iteration. Because the situation on the previous slide fits really</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:05,680 –&gt; 00:07:11,920<br>well with some task we want to repeat multiple times as long as some condition is true. In our case,</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:11,920 –&gt; 00:07:17,680<br>the condition is the user says I want to exit right. So while the user keeps saying exit right,</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:18,640 –&gt; 00:07:23,840<br>show them the woods background and ask them again which way do you want to go? And so while that’s</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:23,840 –&gt; 00:07:29,840<br>true, just repeat this set of things. Check that they said exit right, show them the woods background,</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:29,840 –&gt; 00:07:34,800<br>ask them again. Check that they said exit right, show them the background, ask them again. And if at</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:34,800 –&gt; 00:07:42,080<br>any point they’d say I don’t want to exit right, we break out of this loop and we kind of rejoin the</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:42,080 –&gt; 00:07:46,319<br>rest of the program. That’s kind of the terminology we used with if statements, right? We set the background</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:46,319 –&gt; 00:07:52,719<br>to the exit background and they’re out of the woods. So this sets the scene for wild loops. Here’s</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:52,719 –&gt; 00:07:58,240<br>another example of wild loops sort of in the context of watching a show. So if we want to start a new</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:58,240 –&gt; 00:08:04,000<br>show on Netflix and we want to watch all episodes of the show in one shot, we’re going to tell Netflix</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:04,000 –&gt; 00:08:10,079<br>we’re starting a new show. And while there are more episodes to watch in this show, we’re going to</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:10,079 –&gt; 00:08:15,439<br>keep watching the next episode, right? So if there are no more episodes to watch, then we’re done,</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:15,439 –&gt; 00:08:21,199<br>not Python, Netflix will suggest three more shows like this one. And while there are more episodes</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:21,199 –&gt; 00:08:27,279<br>to watch, so yes, there are more episodes to watch, we’re going to play the next episode in sequence.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:28,560 –&gt; 00:08:33,120<br>So that’s the idea that we’re trying to get out with wild loops. In Python, this is how we code</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:33,120 –&gt; 00:08:38,879<br>them. So we start a wild loop with the keyword while. So this again will turn blue in Python because</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:38,879 –&gt; 00:08:45,840<br>it’s a special word. Some condition is true. Okay, so this is against some expression or something</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:45,840 –&gt; 00:08:53,919<br>that will evaluate to a Boolean, like we talked about in last lecture. Okay, colon. And colon tells</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:53,919 –&gt; 00:09:00,480<br>Python we’re starting a code block that’s part of the wild loop being true. And as usual, the code</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:00,480 –&gt; 00:09:06,639<br>block means we’re going to indent these lines of code, right? So whatever we want to execute when</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:06,639 –&gt; 00:09:14,399<br>the condition is true, we’ll be indented. When the indented statements are finished executing,</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:14,399 –&gt; 00:09:22,399<br>Python automatically goes back and recheck the condition. So it recheck whether the condition is true</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:22,399 –&gt; 00:09:28,080<br>or not. And this is done behind the scenes, right? When you code up a wild loop, when you type in the</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:28,080 –&gt; 00:09:34,000<br>keyword while, Python will automatically do this behavior. It’ll check the condition, it’ll execute the</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:34,000 –&gt; 00:09:38,879<br>lines of code indented. And then it’ll go back and check the condition again. If it’s still true,</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:38,879 –&gt; 00:09:43,039<br>it’ll execute the lines of code indented again. And then it’ll check the condition again. So it’s</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:43,039 –&gt; 00:09:47,519<br>not something you have to code up. You don’t have to tell it to go back as long as you’re writing</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:47,519 –&gt; 00:09:55,039<br>this wild loop, Python will automatically do that sequence of steps for you. Okay. So when the</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:55,039 –&gt; 00:10:00,320<br>condition becomes false, Python will no longer execute the stuff inside the stuff that’s</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:00,320 –&gt; 00:10:04,800<br>indented inside the wild loop. And it’ll go rejoin the rest of the program at the same</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:04,800 –&gt; 00:10:14,000<br>indentation level as the wild loop. Okay. So notice that the condition is kind of something that’s</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:14,000 –&gt; 00:10:21,440<br>dependent on, or sorry, the fact that we’re doing this code over and over again depends on this</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:21,440 –&gt; 00:10:30,000<br>condition being true. So if the code inside is not ever changing anything related to our condition,</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:30,640 –&gt; 00:10:37,520<br>then it’s very likely, it’s actually for sure, that this loop will execute infinite number of</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:37,520 –&gt; 00:10:42,960<br>times. So this is kind of the pitfall of wild loops. It’s possible that if you’re not careful,</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:42,960 –&gt; 00:10:49,840<br>your code will execute infinite number of times and it’ll just never, never terminate. And I’ll</p>
<p>108<br>00:10:49,840 –&gt; 00:10:56,240<br>show you how to deal with that in a couple slides. So let’s try to code up this, this last woods</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:56,240 –&gt; 00:11:06,240<br>program in our, just with a wild loop. So here we’ve got our question that we ask the user,</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:06,240 –&gt; 00:11:12,000<br>do you want to go left or right? And we’re going to grab the user input as a string and save it in</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:12,000 –&gt; 00:11:17,840<br>a variable called where. So whatever the user types in, it’ll be saved in a variable called where.</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:17,840 –&gt; 00:11:23,680<br>So in my computer memory, the way this looks like, if the user types in right, that particular</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:23,679 –&gt; 00:11:29,759<br>sequence of characters, that’ll be saved as the variable where. So then we finish this first</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:29,759 –&gt; 00:11:34,879<br>line of the code here and then we check why all the value of where is equivalent to right.</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:36,159 –&gt; 00:11:40,239<br>What are we going to do? We’re going to ask the user again, where do you want to go left or right?</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:41,359 –&gt; 00:11:47,599<br>So I’m going to save right again and then this memory is going to look exactly the same. If the</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:47,600 –&gt; 00:11:55,519<br>user keeps typing in right, I keep reassigning the variable where to have the value RIGHT.</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:56,960 –&gt; 00:12:02,480<br>At some point, the user might type in left, in which case we’re going to lose the binding from</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:03,600 –&gt; 00:12:10,159<br>a variable where, from the specific sequence of characters RIGHT, we’re going to bind it now to</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:10,159 –&gt; 00:12:16,080<br>the characters LFT. So at some point, after repeating this many times, the user will type in left,</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:16,080 –&gt; 00:12:21,600<br>and we’re going to have where is equal to left. And at that point, when the condition is being</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:21,600 –&gt; 00:12:27,440<br>checked again, Python will say, nope, this is not equivalent. So I’m not going to go inside this code</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:27,440 –&gt; 00:12:34,320<br>block. I’m just going to go down here and print you got out of the loss forest. So in code, the way</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:34,400 –&gt; 00:12:47,920<br>this looks is this first one here. So you’re going to loss forest, go left or right. So if I type in</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:48,560 –&gt; 00:12:54,960<br>right, it just keeps asking me which way to go. And at some point, I can type in left and I’m out.</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:54,960 –&gt; 00:13:04,560<br>So it’s pretty cool, right? We just made our own level in this text adventure. Let’s have you</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:04,560 –&gt; 00:13:12,320<br>think about this question. What if the user types in capital RIGHT? What do you think will happen?</p>
<p>128<br>00:13:12,320 –&gt; 00:13:17,680<br>Are we going to ask the user to go left or right again? Or are we going to tell them that they</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:17,679 –&gt; 00:13:26,239<br>got out of the forest? Yeah, they got out. Do you want to say why? Yeah, exactly, because it’s not</p>
<p>130<br>00:13:26,239 –&gt; 00:13:33,199<br>lower case. So remember when we’re doing comparison so the equal equal on strings, it has to be the</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:33,199 –&gt; 00:13:38,639<br>same case, right? It’s case sensitive. And so capital RIGHT, or even some combination like just</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:38,639 –&gt; 00:13:48,879<br>capital R, lower case RIGHT, is also going to give us that we got out. So this is counterintuitive,</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:48,879 –&gt; 00:14:00,159<br>right? To what we see as humans, because we see RIGHT no matter what to be, to mean right. So work</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:00,159 –&gt; 00:14:04,960<br>around for this would be to use sort of a command on the string to maybe convert everything to</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:04,960 –&gt; 00:14:11,680<br>lower case, just so it sees more easily compared or something like that. Okay, so another use of</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:11,680 –&gt; 00:14:18,560<br>while loops is with numbers. Okay, let’s look at this example. I’m going to ask the user for an</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:18,560 –&gt; 00:14:23,519<br>integer. And then I’m going to do something really simple. I’m going to print x to the screen,</p>
<p>138<br>00:14:23,519 –&gt; 00:14:29,040<br>however many times the user told me. So if the user gives me four, I’m going to print x four times</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:29,039 –&gt; 00:14:37,120<br>to the screen. So what is this code doing in memory? Well, the user gives me, let’s say four,</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:37,120 –&gt; 00:14:43,039<br>what happened step by step? First we see our while loop. So I’m going to check whether four,</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:43,039 –&gt; 00:14:48,399<br>the current value of n is greater than zero. Yes, that’s true. I’m going to print x to the screen.</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:49,120 –&gt; 00:14:54,159<br>And then I’m going to do the next line of code that’s part of this indented block, which is to take</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:54,159 –&gt; 00:15:00,559<br>n and assign it to whatever n is minus one. So I’m going to lose the binding from the four and I’m</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:00,559 –&gt; 00:15:06,639<br>going to take four minus one to be three, create a new object and bind n to the three. Okay,</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:07,519 –&gt; 00:15:11,759<br>next Python again, it’s part of a while loop. So automatically it looks at the condition again and</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:11,759 –&gt; 00:15:17,039<br>says, well, now the value of n is still greater than zero. Yeah, three is still greater than zero. So</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:17,039 –&gt; 00:15:21,600<br>again, we’re going to lose the binding, sorry, we’re printing x to the screen first. And then we lose</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:21,600 –&gt; 00:15:29,519<br>the binding from the current value of n, three, two, two. Okay, so we’re decrymenting n by one</p>
<p>149<br>00:15:29,519 –&gt; 00:15:35,600<br>each time through this while loop. Okay, then again, Python checks the condition. It says two is</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:35,600 –&gt; 00:15:40,800<br>still greater than zero. So again, we print another x to the screen and then we decrement n by one.</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:40,800 –&gt; 00:15:46,560<br>So we’re binding n to one. Again, Python checks the condition is one still greater than zero. Yes,</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:46,559 –&gt; 00:15:51,919<br>so we print another x to the screen. So we’ve printed four x’s now to the screen and then Python says</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:51,919 –&gt; 00:15:57,199<br>now I’m going to make n to be zero. And then at this point, Python will do another check. Is it</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:57,199 –&gt; 00:16:04,719<br>say it’s going to say is zero greater than zero? And that’s going to be false. So it’s not going to</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:04,719 –&gt; 00:16:09,519<br>execute the code lock anymore and the program will be done, right? There’s no sort of code to</p>
<p>156<br>00:16:09,519 –&gt; 00:16:15,439<br>rejoin anymore. There’s just the end of the program. So we would have printed four x’s to the screen.</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:15,440 –&gt; 00:16:19,920<br>And this is in the Python file I gave you, you can feel free to run it to double check.</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:21,920 –&gt; 00:16:27,680<br>My question is what happens, and this is a really common mistake, what happens if we forget this</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:27,680 –&gt; 00:16:40,080<br>last line? We can try it. I can try it in here. Yeah, exactly. It’s going to go on forever. I’ll</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:40,080 –&gt; 00:16:47,520<br>show you what that looks like. So this is the code when we just have it working as usual. So if I</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:47,520 –&gt; 00:16:53,280<br>type in three, it prints three of those x’s. But if I happen to forget to write this last line,</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:53,280 –&gt; 00:16:59,360<br>I’m just going to comment it out. And if I run the program, I can enter any number. And it’ll just</p>
<p>163<br>00:16:59,360 –&gt; 00:17:05,279<br>keep printing stuff to the console. Right, so this is what it’s just printing a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:06,240 –&gt; 00:17:09,599<br>So you can see this is all this stuff it printed.</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:11,920 –&gt; 00:17:19,680<br>So yeah, we don’t have a program that terminates because the condition here is never actually being</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:20,639 –&gt; 00:17:26,240<br>the variable that’s part of this condition is never actually being changed inside my loop, right?</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:26,240 –&gt; 00:17:32,160<br>And so that’s a big problem. When that happens, what we can do and what I just did here is I’m going</p>
<p>168<br>00:17:32,480 –&gt; 00:17:38,560<br>to click the shell and hit Ctrl C or Command C on a Mac. And that will just end the program manually.</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:39,440 –&gt; 00:17:45,680<br>Or you can just click the red x in the corner. So here’s another example of it going infinite. And</p>
<p>170<br>00:17:45,680 –&gt; 00:17:50,560<br>there’s this little red, sorry red box in the corner. You can click that or you can click the three</p>
<p>171<br>00:17:50,560 –&gt; 00:17:56,720<br>lines, say interrupt kernel. All that will stop the program. So in this class, we’re not actually</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:56,720 –&gt; 00:18:01,759<br>going to write programs that take seconds to run. So if you find yourself waiting for your program</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:01,759 –&gt; 00:18:06,160<br>for more than one or two seconds, then likely you’ve entered an infinite loop. So you’ll want to</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:06,160 –&gt; 00:18:17,839<br>stop it and try to see where your program went wrong. Okay, so give this a try if you want.</p>
<p>175<br>00:18:18,799 –&gt; 00:18:24,000<br>Just so you get the hang up stopping an infinite program because you’ll very likely run</p>
<p>176<br>00:18:24,000 –&gt; 00:18:31,039<br>write a program that that doesn’t terminate. So while true, what’s the condition here?</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:33,680 –&gt; 00:18:39,599<br>It’s just true, right? So there’s no condition that’s being checked. This program will run always</p>
<p>178<br>00:18:39,599 –&gt; 00:18:47,920<br>an infinite times no matter what. Okay, so that’s just this little you try it down here on line 44.</p>
<p>179<br>00:18:47,920 –&gt; 00:18:53,359<br>Just run it. As soon as you run it, it’s just going to print that to the screen over and over again.</p>
<p>180<br>00:18:53,359 –&gt; 00:18:58,000<br>Be sure to click the shell to put the focus on there and hit control C or hit the red X.</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:02,319 –&gt; 00:19:10,479<br>All right. So the big idea with while loops is that they can repeat the code inside them indefinitely.</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:10,479 –&gt; 00:19:17,279<br>So we have to be a little bit careful with what our conditions are and whether we’re actually</p>
<p>183<br>00:19:17,279 –&gt; 00:19:23,359<br>making progress towards having that condition become false at some point. And when that happens,</p>
<p>184<br>00:19:23,359 –&gt; 00:19:28,319<br>when they run indefinitely, you’ll have to manually intervene to close the program.</p>
<p>185<br>00:19:30,720 –&gt; 00:19:40,000<br>Okay, so now that we’ve seen a loop with a little bit of numerical computation inside it,</p>
<p>186<br>00:19:40,000 –&gt; 00:19:44,799<br>so we were changing the value of an inside our loop, let’s have you work on this little program.</p>
<p>187<br>00:19:44,799 –&gt; 00:19:52,319<br>It’s an extension of the lost woods. This is exactly the same program that I just ran a few slides ago,</p>
<p>188<br>00:19:52,319 –&gt; 00:20:02,960<br>but what I want you to add is an extra printout. So when the user says write more than two times,</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:03,919 –&gt; 00:20:09,200<br>the next time you ask them whether they go left or right, I’d like you to print a sad face right</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:09,200 –&gt; 00:20:13,359<br>before you ask them that question. It can be on a different line. It doesn’t have to be on the same line.</p>
<p>191<br>00:20:15,200 –&gt; 00:20:21,519<br>And the way to do that is to try to create a new variable that’s going to be like your counter.</p>
<p>192<br>00:20:21,519 –&gt; 00:20:30,079<br>That keeps track of how many times the user has, how many times this while loop has repeated.</p>
<p>193<br>00:20:30,079 –&gt; 00:20:33,200<br>I’ll give you a couple moments to do that and then we’ll write it together.</p>
<p>194<br>00:20:35,680 –&gt; 00:20:40,480<br>As usual, the UTRIID is in here, so you can just uncomment the code</p>
<p>195<br>00:20:41,440 –&gt; 00:20:51,440<br>with in Inspiter, it’s Control-1 or Command-1 to batch uncomment, and then you can work off of this code to try to improve it.</p>
<p>196<br>00:20:54,480 –&gt; 00:20:59,519<br>Okay, so does anyone have a start for me? How can we do this? You don’t have to give it to me.</p>
<p>197<br>00:21:00,319 –&gt; 00:21:06,000<br>In full, we can work our way up to the final program, but what’s kind of the first your first thought here?</p>
<p>198<br>00:21:10,480 –&gt; 00:21:19,440<br>Yes, all right.</p>
<p>199<br>00:21:19,440 –&gt; 00:21:30,079<br>We can create a variable N at the beginning of our program. What do you want to make it?</p>
<p>200<br>00:21:30,079 –&gt; 00:21:37,920<br>Zero. Okay, good. Zero will keep track, or N will keep track of how many times we’ve gone through the loop.</p>
<p>201<br>00:21:38,640 –&gt; 00:21:45,680<br>So inside our program, when do we want to change N?</p>
<p>202<br>00:21:45,680 –&gt; 00:21:48,160<br>Sorry, every time we go through the loop, right?</p>
<p>203<br>00:21:49,120 –&gt; 00:21:53,680<br>So every time we want to go through the loop, we want to change N to be a new value,</p>
<p>204<br>00:21:54,320 –&gt; 00:21:58,960<br>so maybe we want to increase it by one, so N is equal to N plus one.</p>
<p>205<br>00:22:01,279 –&gt; 00:22:06,080<br>So now this will keep track of how many times we’ve gone through the loop, and we can actually</p>
<p>206<br>00:22:06,079 –&gt; 00:22:16,960<br>double check this by printing N, right? So if we run it, and we say, right, we’ve gone once, right?</p>
<p>207<br>00:22:16,960 –&gt; 00:22:24,000<br>We’ve got twice, right? We’ve got three times, right? So this means we’re incrementing it correctly.</p>
<p>208<br>00:22:24,720 –&gt; 00:22:29,519<br>Now, what can I do with this variable N? Now that I have it, and I know it’s incrementing correctly.</p>
<p>209<br>00:22:31,359 –&gt; 00:22:31,839<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>210<br>00:22:31,839 –&gt; 00:22:32,959<br>Set up an if statement.</p>
<p>211<br>00:22:34,159 –&gt; 00:22:41,279<br>Yep, we can set up an if statement, so we can check if that value of N is greater than two,</p>
<p>212<br>00:22:41,279 –&gt; 00:22:46,240<br>right? According to this specification here, what do you want to do when if is greater than two?</p>
<p>213<br>00:22:48,079 –&gt; 00:22:50,559<br>Print something, right? So we can print the sad face.</p>
<p>214<br>00:22:54,399 –&gt; 00:23:00,240<br>And let’s try to run it now. So if we immediately hit left, right? It still works.</p>
<p>215<br>00:23:00,319 –&gt; 00:23:06,799<br>If we go right one time, nothing, right? Another time, nothing, right? A last time sad.</p>
<p>216<br>00:23:06,799 –&gt; 00:23:10,480<br>And from now on, it’s going to keep showing me the sad face.</p>
<p>217<br>00:23:16,640 –&gt; 00:23:20,160<br>Questions about this code? Yeah.</p>
<p>218<br>00:23:20,240 –&gt; 00:23:26,640<br>Is it possible to test for something that’s non equivalent? Like, is there a sign that’s different than the code?</p>
<p>219<br>00:23:28,240 –&gt; 00:23:31,759<br>Can we check for not equivalency here? Yeah.</p>
<p>220<br>00:23:33,600 –&gt; 00:23:37,600<br>So this particular check checks for what the user typed in.</p>
<p>221<br>00:23:41,200 –&gt; 00:23:48,560<br>It’s possible we can add this if statement that checks for the N in here and something else.</p>
<p>222<br>00:23:48,559 –&gt; 00:23:55,200<br>But then we would have to have maybe another, I’d have to think about it.</p>
<p>223<br>00:23:55,200 –&gt; 00:23:58,799<br>But it is, it might be possible to try to combine them inside the while loop.</p>
<p>224<br>00:23:58,799 –&gt; 00:24:01,839<br>But they’re easy to simplify a lot of things.</p>
<p>225<br>00:24:01,839 –&gt; 00:24:05,200<br>Oh, to do not equals. That would be the not equal sign. Yeah.</p>
<p>226<br>00:24:07,119 –&gt; 00:24:12,159<br>So another thing we can do with while loops is to iterate through numbers in a sequence.</p>
<p>227<br>00:24:13,120 –&gt; 00:24:19,600<br>If we do this, there’s a really common pattern, which actually leads us to the next kind of loop we’re</p>
<p>228<br>00:24:19,600 –&gt; 00:24:25,200<br>going to see on the next slide. But the pattern, when you want to iterate through numbers in a sequence,</p>
<p>229<br>00:24:25,200 –&gt; 00:24:29,360<br>is you first set a loop variable before the while loop.</p>
<p>230<br>00:24:30,240 –&gt; 00:24:34,880<br>Inside the condition for the loop, you do some sort of check without variable.</p>
<p>231<br>00:24:35,920 –&gt; 00:24:38,320<br>So N was my loop variable outside the loop.</p>
<p>232<br>00:24:38,319 –&gt; 00:24:40,720<br>And then I test it inside the while loop.</p>
<p>233<br>00:24:40,720 –&gt; 00:24:42,559<br>So N is less than, less than 5.</p>
<p>234<br>00:24:43,279 –&gt; 00:24:47,839<br>And then within the while loop, you can do whatever commands you want to do with that N.</p>
<p>235<br>00:24:48,399 –&gt; 00:24:51,919<br>But then you have to remember to change it in some way.</p>
<p>236<br>00:24:51,919 –&gt; 00:24:57,679<br>Because if you don’t change it in some way, this while loop condition will always be true.</p>
<p>237<br>00:24:58,319 –&gt; 00:25:02,240<br>So here I’m incrementing N by 1 because it starts from 0.</p>
<p>238<br>00:25:02,879 –&gt; 00:25:06,000<br>I want N to get to something, right?</p>
<p>239<br>00:25:06,000 –&gt; 00:25:09,039<br>Something above 5, which will lead to my condition becoming false.</p>
<p>240<br>00:25:11,920 –&gt; 00:25:16,640<br>So this pattern is actually exists in a bunch of different programs.</p>
<p>241<br>00:25:16,640 –&gt; 00:25:19,599<br>So here’s a program that calculates factorial for me.</p>
<p>242<br>00:25:21,839 –&gt; 00:25:24,000<br>And here I’m calculating four factorial.</p>
<p>243<br>00:25:24,000 –&gt; 00:25:25,759<br>I’m not excited about the number four.</p>
<p>244<br>00:25:25,759 –&gt; 00:25:27,200<br>That’s four factorial.</p>
<p>245<br>00:25:27,839 –&gt; 00:25:28,640<br>How do we do this?</p>
<p>246<br>00:25:29,599 –&gt; 00:25:32,079<br>Well, there’s a lot of things I’m initializing here.</p>
<p>247<br>00:25:32,879 –&gt; 00:25:40,399<br>But the more you work with loops, you’ll get used to seeing what is the loop variable.</p>
<p>248<br>00:25:41,119 –&gt; 00:25:43,839<br>So I is actually going to be my loop variable.</p>
<p>249<br>00:25:45,359 –&gt; 00:25:49,199<br>Here it’s being set to some value, initially, outside the loop.</p>
<p>250<br>00:25:50,319 –&gt; 00:25:54,000<br>Inside the conditional, I’m doing some condition check with it.</p>
<p>251<br>00:25:56,879 –&gt; 00:26:01,759<br>Inside the body of that conditional, I’m changing it in some way.</p>
<p>252<br>00:26:01,759 –&gt; 00:26:08,079<br>That gives me some sort of, that takes me to the end of my conditional here.</p>
<p>253<br>00:26:09,119 –&gt; 00:26:10,319<br>So I’m setting i to 0.</p>
<p>254<br>00:26:10,319 –&gt; 00:26:12,799<br>I’m incrementing i by 1 each time through the loop.</p>
<p>255<br>00:26:13,359 –&gt; 00:26:17,279<br>And I’m making forward progress towards making i greater than x.</p>
<p>256<br>00:26:18,799 –&gt; 00:26:21,039<br>At which point my conditional will become false.</p>
<p>257<br>00:26:23,440 –&gt; 00:26:28,799<br>The rest of the code, x is equal to four, just sets the thing I want to get the factorial of.</p>
<p>258<br>00:26:29,759 –&gt; 00:26:33,839<br>And this factorial variable is kind of my running product.</p>
<p>259<br>00:26:33,839 –&gt; 00:26:37,440<br>So it’s the thing that I’m going to keep multiplying to figure out what the factorial is.</p>
<p>260<br>00:26:38,159 –&gt; 00:26:40,240<br>So here I’m initializing it to one.</p>
<p>261<br>00:26:40,240 –&gt; 00:26:44,000<br>And inside the loop, I’m multiplying it by my loop variable every time.</p>
<p>262<br>00:26:45,039 –&gt; 00:26:49,519<br>So I’m not going to do a memory diagram for this example.</p>
<p>263<br>00:26:49,519 –&gt; 00:26:51,039<br>But I will do the Python tutor.</p>
<p>264<br>00:26:53,119 –&gt; 00:26:55,680<br>And I’m going to step through to show you exactly what this is doing.</p>
<p>265<br>00:26:55,680 –&gt; 00:26:59,600<br>So x is four, i is one originally, and factorial is one.</p>
<p>266<br>00:26:59,600 –&gt; 00:27:01,759<br>So x is the thing I want to get the factorial of.</p>
<p>267<br>00:27:02,400 –&gt; 00:27:08,000<br>i is going to be my loop variable, and factorial is my running product.</p>
<p>268<br>00:27:09,039 –&gt; 00:27:13,120<br>So next step, i1 is less than or equal to four.</p>
<p>269<br>00:27:13,120 –&gt; 00:27:14,320<br>So I’m going to enter the loop.</p>
<p>270<br>00:27:15,360 –&gt; 00:27:20,640<br>Python will calculate the factorial as whatever it is right now multiplied by 1i.</p>
<p>271<br>00:27:21,039 –&gt; 00:27:21,920<br>So it’s still one.</p>
<p>272<br>00:27:22,720 –&gt; 00:27:27,360<br>And then I’m going to increment i from whatever it is now to one.</p>
<p>273<br>00:27:27,360 –&gt; 00:27:36,000<br>So I just want to mention this i plus equals one is equivalent to saying i equals i plus one.</p>
<p>274<br>00:27:37,039 –&gt; 00:27:40,320<br>And this is true no matter what variable you have here.</p>
<p>275<br>00:27:40,320 –&gt; 00:27:48,000<br>Basically, if you have fact times equals two or something like that,</p>
<p>276<br>00:27:48,000 –&gt; 00:27:53,359<br>that basically means factorial equals fact times two.</p>
<p>277<br>00:27:54,559 –&gt; 00:27:56,400<br>So that’s kind of the pattern here.</p>
<p>278<br>00:27:56,400 –&gt; 00:27:58,559<br>These are equivalent and these are equivalent.</p>
<p>279<br>00:27:58,559 –&gt; 00:28:00,640<br>This is just a shorthand notation and programming.</p>
<p>280<br>00:28:01,839 –&gt; 00:28:03,200<br>So that’s what this line here means.</p>
<p>281<br>00:28:03,200 –&gt; 00:28:06,640<br>i plus equals one means i equals i plus one.</p>
<p>282<br>00:28:08,160 –&gt; 00:28:12,000<br>So at this line here, I’m taking whatever i is and adding one to it, too.</p>
<p>283<br>00:28:13,119 –&gt; 00:28:14,640<br>And then I do the check again.</p>
<p>284<br>00:28:14,640 –&gt; 00:28:16,800<br>And remember, Python does this automatically, right?</p>
<p>285<br>00:28:16,800 –&gt; 00:28:18,800<br>Because we’re using a y-loop.</p>
<p>286<br>00:28:18,800 –&gt; 00:28:23,600<br>It goes back to the condition and checks it again using these new values for the variables.</p>
<p>287<br>00:28:24,160 –&gt; 00:28:26,160<br>Two is still less than or equal to four.</p>
<p>288<br>00:28:26,160 –&gt; 00:28:28,080<br>So again, we go inside the loop body.</p>
<p>289<br>00:28:28,560 –&gt; 00:28:32,400<br>Factorial is whatever it is right now, one, multiplied by i2.</p>
<p>290<br>00:28:34,800 –&gt; 00:28:37,200<br>i is going to be two plus one, three.</p>
<p>291<br>00:28:38,400 –&gt; 00:28:41,120<br>And then again, I’m checking that three is less than or equal to four.</p>
<p>292<br>00:28:41,120 –&gt; 00:28:42,000<br>It still is.</p>
<p>293<br>00:28:42,000 –&gt; 00:28:45,440<br>So then we’re going to do factorial is whatever it is now, two.</p>
<p>294<br>00:28:45,440 –&gt; 00:28:47,839<br>Multiply by whatever i is, three.</p>
<p>295<br>00:28:47,839 –&gt; 00:28:48,799<br>So now it’s six.</p>
<p>296<br>00:28:49,680 –&gt; 00:28:52,799<br>i is going to be one more than what it is right now, four.</p>
<p>297<br>00:28:52,799 –&gt; 00:28:55,200<br>Four is still less than or equal to four.</p>
<p>298<br>00:28:55,200 –&gt; 00:28:57,359<br>We’re going to go inside the body.</p>
<p>299<br>00:28:58,000 –&gt; 00:29:01,839<br>Factorial is whatever it is right now, six, multiplied by four.</p>
<p>300<br>00:29:03,119 –&gt; 00:29:04,400<br>And then 24.</p>
<p>301<br>00:29:04,400 –&gt; 00:29:08,160<br>And then i is going to be whatever it is right now, plus one, five.</p>
<p>302<br>00:29:08,800 –&gt; 00:29:11,360<br>At this point, Python says is five less than or equal to four.</p>
<p>303<br>00:29:12,160 –&gt; 00:29:12,480<br>No.</p>
<p>304<br>00:29:13,519 –&gt; 00:29:15,040<br>And then it breaks the loop.</p>
<p>305<br>00:29:15,040 –&gt; 00:29:18,720<br>And it goes to print this statement for factorial is.</p>
<p>306<br>00:29:19,519 –&gt; 00:29:22,320<br>And then it grabs whatever the value of the factorial is.</p>
<p>307<br>00:29:22,320 –&gt; 00:29:28,000<br>So here, I’m using this f string print that notation that we learned about last lecture.</p>
<p>308<br>00:29:29,040 –&gt; 00:29:31,440<br>So I encourage you to go through it yourself.</p>
<p>309<br>00:29:32,480 –&gt; 00:29:33,519<br>Just step by step.</p>
<p>310<br>00:29:33,519 –&gt; 00:29:36,080<br>That’s what Python tutors really, really useful for.</p>
<p>311<br>00:29:36,639 –&gt; 00:29:40,960<br>Okay, so let’s look at a different kind of loop called a for loop.</p>
<p>312<br>00:29:40,960 –&gt; 00:29:42,000<br>Okay.</p>
<p>313<br>00:29:42,000 –&gt; 00:29:49,679<br>And the for loop is going to allow us to rewrite that special kind of wild loop that we saw,</p>
<p>314<br>00:29:49,679 –&gt; 00:29:54,480<br>where we initialize a variable, we test the variable, we do something to the variable within the code,</p>
<p>315<br>00:29:54,480 –&gt; 00:29:56,480<br>in a more efficient, more readable way.</p>
<p>316<br>00:29:57,279 –&gt; 00:29:59,519<br>So in terms of our Netflix example,</p>
<p>317<br>00:30:01,039 –&gt; 00:30:04,559<br>a for loop would be equivalent to something like Netflix, right,</p>
<p>318<br>00:30:04,559 –&gt; 00:30:06,000<br>if you’re not interacting with it,</p>
<p>319<br>00:30:06,000 –&gt; 00:30:08,720<br>cuts you off after four episodes, right, to save bandwidth.</p>
<p>320<br>00:30:09,440 –&gt; 00:30:14,799<br>And so there’s a sequence of four episodes it knows it’s going to go through if there’s nothing,</p>
<p>321<br>00:30:14,799 –&gt; 00:30:16,159<br>if you’re not interacting with it.</p>
<p>322<br>00:30:16,960 –&gt; 00:30:20,960<br>So if you’ve already gone through your sequence of four episodes,</p>
<p>323<br>00:30:20,960 –&gt; 00:30:23,039<br>you’re allowed to watch without any interaction,</p>
<p>324<br>00:30:23,759 –&gt; 00:30:24,639<br>it’s done, right?</p>
<p>325<br>00:30:24,639 –&gt; 00:30:25,440<br>It cuts you off.</p>
<p>326<br>00:30:25,440 –&gt; 00:30:26,720<br>It says, are you still watching?</p>
<p>327<br>00:30:27,599 –&gt; 00:30:32,399<br>But if there are still more episodes, if it only showed you two out of the four,</p>
<p>328<br>00:30:32,400 –&gt; 00:30:37,200<br>then it’s going to keep showing you more episodes until it’s shown you the four.</p>
<p>329<br>00:30:39,840 –&gt; 00:30:45,360<br>So this is the program we had with wild loops a couple slides ago.</p>
<p>330<br>00:30:47,280 –&gt; 00:30:49,360<br>And remember, we were initializing a variable,</p>
<p>331<br>00:30:49,360 –&gt; 00:30:51,759<br>we were testing the variable, some condition here,</p>
<p>332<br>00:30:51,759 –&gt; 00:30:56,240<br>and then we were incrementing the variable or doing something that gives us nice forward</p>
<p>333<br>00:30:56,240 –&gt; 00:30:59,200<br>progress towards making this condition false.</p>
<p>334<br>00:31:00,080 –&gt; 00:31:01,280<br>But it’s really verbose.</p>
<p>335<br>00:31:02,400 –&gt; 00:31:06,480<br>Certainly it works, you can do it, but it’s very easy to forget to do this,</p>
<p>336<br>00:31:06,480 –&gt; 00:31:10,000<br>something like this, in which case you’ll get an infinite loop.</p>
<p>337<br>00:31:10,720 –&gt; 00:31:16,640<br>With a four loop, those four lines of code just look like these two lines of code.</p>
<p>338<br>00:31:18,240 –&gt; 00:31:21,600<br>So if there’s a sequence of values you ever want to iterate over,</p>
<p>339<br>00:31:21,600 –&gt; 00:31:24,000<br>that’s what four loops are useful for.</p>
<p>340<br>00:31:25,680 –&gt; 00:31:30,160<br>So the syntax for a four loop looks a little bit different than a wild loop.</p>
<p>341<br>00:31:30,160 –&gt; 00:31:32,480<br>It starts with a four keyword.</p>
<p>342<br>00:31:33,360 –&gt; 00:31:36,640<br>This is a variable that you get to name, whatever name you’d like.</p>
<p>343<br>00:31:37,200 –&gt; 00:31:44,640<br>The keyword in tells Python, I’m going to make this variable take on values in this sequence.</p>
<p>344<br>00:31:47,279 –&gt; 00:31:54,640<br>And again, we have a colon that tells Python, we’re going to start a code in indentation here.</p>
<p>345<br>00:31:54,640 –&gt; 00:31:58,720<br>And whatever lines of code you have that are indented are going to be executed.</p>
<p>346<br>00:32:00,240 –&gt; 00:32:02,480<br>However many sequence of values you have.</p>
<p>347<br>00:32:03,759 –&gt; 00:32:09,120<br>So the first time through the loop, Python will make this variable name take on the first</p>
<p>348<br>00:32:09,120 –&gt; 00:32:12,400<br>value in the sequence. And then it’s going to execute this code.</p>
<p>349<br>00:32:14,320 –&gt; 00:32:20,160<br>Automatically, Python will, after it finishes executing these codes, it will go back</p>
<p>350<br>00:32:20,720 –&gt; 00:32:24,080<br>and set this variable have the next value in the sequence</p>
<p>351<br>00:32:24,800 –&gt; 00:32:27,040<br>and execute the same lines of code.</p>
<p>352<br>00:32:27,119 –&gt; 00:32:31,599<br>When it’s done, it’s going to make the variable here take on the next values in the sequence</p>
<p>353<br>00:32:31,599 –&gt; 00:32:33,200<br>and execute those lines of code.</p>
<p>354<br>00:32:33,200 –&gt; 00:32:39,440<br>And so these lines of code will effectively be executed, however many values you have in your sequence.</p>
<p>355<br>00:32:42,000 –&gt; 00:32:47,359<br>So more practically speaking, here we have a variable, so n in this case,</p>
<p>356<br>00:32:47,920 –&gt; 00:32:52,960<br>in some some sequence of values, in this case I’m saying range five,</p>
<p>357<br>00:32:53,680 –&gt; 00:32:55,279<br>we’re going to print the value of n.</p>
<p>358<br>00:32:55,599 –&gt; 00:32:58,639<br>So I’m going to introduce range now.</p>
<p>359<br>00:32:58,639 –&gt; 00:33:06,559<br>Range is a way for us to grab numerical sequence of values that have some sort of pattern.</p>
<p>360<br>00:33:07,599 –&gt; 00:33:13,200<br>So if we just say range some number, the pattern is we started zero and we go up to but not</p>
<p>361<br>00:33:13,200 –&gt; 00:33:19,039<br>including that number. So range five means the sequence of values Python will iterate over</p>
<p>362<br>00:33:19,039 –&gt; 00:33:24,480<br>our zero one two three and four. Range ten means zero one two three four five six seven eight nine.</p>
<p>363<br>00:33:24,480 –&gt; 00:33:28,720<br>Right, so we go up to but not including the value in the range starting from zero.</p>
<p>364<br>00:33:30,079 –&gt; 00:33:36,079<br>So each time through the loop, Python will change the value of n to be every one of those values</p>
<p>365<br>00:33:36,079 –&gt; 00:33:43,039<br>automatically. So these two lines here for n and range five print n, the way they look like</p>
<p>366<br>00:33:43,039 –&gt; 00:33:48,799<br>behind the scenes and Python does this for you is first it the first time it encounters the</p>
<p>367<br>00:33:48,799 –&gt; 00:33:56,639<br>for loop it sets n to be zero. That’s the first value in my sequence and then it prints the value of n</p>
<p>368<br>00:33:56,639 –&gt; 00:34:02,399<br>zero. Next time through the loop, Python will say okay I’ve done what you asked me to do inside the</p>
<p>369<br>00:34:02,399 –&gt; 00:34:09,440<br>colu print n. I’m going to make n have the next value in my sequence. So it loses the binding from</p>
<p>370<br>00:34:09,440 –&gt; 00:34:15,200<br>the zero and makes it be one. Okay, I’ve made n one now what do you want me to do? Well, I’m going</p>
<p>371<br>00:34:15,200 –&gt; 00:34:20,240<br>to execute whatever’s in the in the in the in the printed print n. So I’m going to print one.</p>
<p>372<br>00:34:21,039 –&gt; 00:34:26,400<br>So I’ve already printed zero then I’ve printed one. I’m finished executing the code inside the loop.</p>
<p>373<br>00:34:26,400 –&gt; 00:34:31,679<br>So now n is going to get the next value in the sequence lose the binding from one and you get two</p>
<p>374<br>00:34:32,559 –&gt; 00:34:39,280<br>and so on and so on and by the end this program will have printed zero one two three and four.</p>
<p>375<br>00:34:40,159 –&gt; 00:34:49,360<br>Every single value in my range. So it turns out that we can actually make range have three</p>
<p>376<br>00:34:49,360 –&gt; 00:34:54,320<br>values inside the parentheses not just one. One is sort of shorthand notation if you ever want to</p>
<p>377<br>00:34:54,320 –&gt; 00:35:00,480<br>start from zero and want to go and go up to in including sorry up to but not including the value</p>
<p>378<br>00:35:00,480 –&gt; 00:35:07,119<br>in the parentheses. But you can actually give it three values a start a stop and a step and Python</p>
<p>379<br>00:35:07,119 –&gt; 00:35:13,839<br>will automatically generate a sequence of values that matches this pattern. So this should seem</p>
<p>380<br>00:35:13,839 –&gt; 00:35:20,480<br>familiar to you right because we’ve seen something like this when we were doing strings right except</p>
<p>381<br>00:35:20,480 –&gt; 00:35:25,359<br>that we weren’t doing parentheses we were doing square brackets and we weren’t doing commas we</p>
<p>382<br>00:35:25,359 –&gt; 00:35:32,319<br>were doing colonists. But it’s the exact same idea. Here we’re generating numbers actual integers</p>
<p>383<br>00:35:32,320 –&gt; 00:35:39,680<br>that we want a loop variable to take on. So if we will start in step start by default is zero</p>
<p>384<br>00:35:39,680 –&gt; 00:35:47,039<br>and step by default is one. If we will meet step by default it will be one. So here i and range</p>
<p>385<br>00:35:47,039 –&gt; 00:35:55,039<br>four the variable i will take on the values zero one two and three. i and range three comma five i</p>
<p>386<br>00:35:55,039 –&gt; 00:35:59,360<br>will take on the values three and four. So we go up to but not including the five.</p>
<p>387<br>00:35:59,519 –&gt; 00:36:08,480<br>Think about these three questions. So what are the range of values in the first one and what are we</p>
<p>388<br>00:36:08,480 –&gt; 00:36:15,519<br>going to print? So in one four one what range of values are we going to have i b? So i is going to be one.</p>
<p>389<br>00:36:19,920 –&gt; 00:36:28,960<br>One two three yes and we stop. We go up to but not including the stop which is a four.</p>
<p>390<br>00:36:29,680 –&gt; 00:36:38,800<br>And what are we printing? Yeah one two three just all. How about the next one? J. What will the values of</p>
<p>391<br>00:36:38,800 –&gt; 00:36:48,960<br>j be? One three and that’s it. Yep because we’re going every other every other value. And what are we</p>
<p>392<br>00:36:48,960 –&gt; 00:36:55,440<br>printing here? Yeah exactly. So we’re doing an operation with each one of these j’s. So we’re</p>
<p>393<br>00:36:55,440 –&gt; 00:37:05,440<br>going to print two and then six and how about the last one? We’re stepping backward right the</p>
<p>394<br>00:37:05,440 –&gt; 00:37:16,320<br>negative one. So what’s our start? Four and then three two one and that’s it. We’re going to</p>
<p>395<br>00:37:16,320 –&gt; 00:37:20,880<br>down two but not including the end right so we’re not going to include the zero. And what are we</p>
<p>396<br>00:37:20,880 –&gt; 00:37:32,000<br>printing here? Four dollar signs for the first time and then three dollar signs and then two dollar</p>
<p>397<br>00:37:32,000 –&gt; 00:37:42,079<br>signs and then one dollar. Exactly. So the body obviously can do operations and can manipulate that</p>
<p>398<br>00:37:42,079 –&gt; 00:37:48,960<br>loop variable. So each time that variable goes through it changes right it changes and then you</p>
<p>399<br>00:37:48,960 –&gt; 00:38:00,079<br>can use that to your advantage. So here’s another example of something useful. We can use four loops</p>
<p>400<br>00:38:00,079 –&gt; 00:38:05,199<br>to keep track of how many times we’re going through a loop. And in this particular case we’re writing</p>
<p>401<br>00:38:05,199 –&gt; 00:38:11,679<br>a program that sums all the values from zero all the way up to but not including whatever is in here.</p>
<p>402<br>00:38:12,639 –&gt; 00:38:20,719<br>Right so how are we doing this? Let’s do the memory diagram. We’ve got my sum is equal to zero as the</p>
<p>403<br>00:38:20,719 –&gt; 00:38:29,440<br>first line. So this will be zero in memory right bound to the name my sum. And then the four</p>
<p>404<br>00:38:29,440 –&gt; 00:38:38,159<br>loops will generate for me the values zero through nine right including. So I the first time through</p>
<p>405<br>00:38:38,159 –&gt; 00:38:44,639<br>the loop will have a value of zero. So we’re going to do the operations or the code we’re asked to do</p>
<p>406<br>00:38:44,639 –&gt; 00:38:50,799<br>when i is zero. So my sum will be whatever it is right now plus whatever i is zero so it stays zero.</p>
<p>407<br>00:38:52,399 –&gt; 00:38:58,719<br>Python is done with the code inside so now it’s going to take i and change it to the next value in</p>
<p>408<br>00:38:58,719 –&gt; 00:39:06,079<br>the sequence one. Okay now we’re going to do again the stuff inside the loop with i being one so we’re</p>
<p>409<br>00:39:06,079 –&gt; 00:39:11,599<br>going to take my sum whatever it is right now and add one to it. So it’s one. And then we’re done</p>
<p>410<br>00:39:11,599 –&gt; 00:39:16,719<br>there so Python will take i to be the next value in the sequence two. And then we’re going to do</p>
<p>411<br>00:39:16,719 –&gt; 00:39:24,079<br>again my sum is whatever it is now one plus whatever i is now two so it’s three. Again i will increment</p>
<p>412<br>00:39:24,079 –&gt; 00:39:28,719<br>to three automatically right that’s next value in the sequence so my sum will get a value of six</p>
<p>413<br>00:39:29,679 –&gt; 00:39:36,399<br>and then i will change to four so on and so on and so on until i becomes eight right that’s sort</p>
<p>414<br>00:39:36,399 –&gt; 00:39:44,719<br>of towards the end when i is eight the value of my sum is 36 right zero plus zero plus one plus two</p>
<p>415<br>00:39:44,719 –&gt; 00:39:51,119<br>all the way up to eight is 36 and then when i becomes nine Python will take my sum whatever it is</p>
<p>416<br>00:39:51,119 –&gt; 00:40:00,000<br>right now 36 add nine to it to give us 45. Okay and then that’s the end of the program right there’s</p>
<p>417<br>00:40:00,000 –&gt; 00:40:07,599<br>nothing else to do except to print my sum so at the end of this loop it’s gone through 10 times</p>
<p>418<br>00:40:07,599 –&gt; 00:40:15,359<br>adding zero all the way up to nine we’re going to print 45. Yeah. So I’m trying running it</p>
<p>419<br>00:40:15,360 –&gt; 00:40:24,400<br>in 45 and then just like zero one two three four three four three four. Oh maybe you have another</p>
<p>420<br>00:40:24,400 –&gt; 00:40:28,640<br>print statement or it might be part of another program that’s being run beforehand that you didn’t</p>
<p>421<br>00:40:28,640 –&gt; 00:40:40,640<br>comment out. Okay. Yeah that’s question. The plus equals what it means oh it just means it would</p>
<p>422<br>00:40:40,639 –&gt; 00:40:55,599<br>be like my sum equals my sum plus i it’s just shorthand notation because most of your variable</p>
<p>423<br>00:40:55,599 –&gt; 00:41:01,039<br>things might be really long and it’s really annoying to retie them and so that’s generally why that</p>
<p>424<br>00:41:01,039 –&gt; 00:41:07,359<br>shorthand notation exists. Yeah but it basically means take whatever my sum is and add i to it</p>
<p>425<br>00:41:07,360 –&gt; 00:41:17,920<br>and save it back into the variable my sum. Okay let’s have you try this code real quick so here is</p>
<p>426<br>00:41:17,920 –&gt; 00:41:26,480<br>code it’s already on the Python file to start out with I want you to have this code it’s pretty</p>
<p>427<br>00:41:26,480 –&gt; 00:41:32,880<br>close to working but there’s one issue so we have this for loop that starts at start at ends at end</p>
<p>428<br>00:41:33,440 –&gt; 00:41:38,000<br>and we’re keeping a running sum and then we’re printing the sum at the end so very similar what we</p>
<p>429<br>00:41:38,000 –&gt; 00:41:45,599<br>just saw but what I want this code to do is I want it to go and sum up the start and the end so I</p>
<p>430<br>00:41:45,599 –&gt; 00:41:53,760<br>I want if I have start is 3 and end is 5 I want it to add 3 plus 4 plus 5 right and so this code is</p>
<p>431<br>00:41:53,760 –&gt; 00:42:02,800<br>not doing quite that and I would like you to fix it or to tell me how to fix it so it’s down here</p>
<p>432<br>00:42:03,039 –&gt; 00:42:14,400<br>online 140-ish. First thing you should do is run it and maybe see what answer it actually gives you</p>
<p>433<br>00:42:15,119 –&gt; 00:42:24,559<br>so I just ran it it gave me a 7. When you’re encountering an output that’s not quite what you expect</p>
<p>434<br>00:42:24,559 –&gt; 00:42:28,480<br>one of the first things to do you can obviously use the Python tutor but another thing you can do</p>
<p>435<br>00:42:28,480 –&gt; 00:42:37,760<br>is put print statements at various places useful places would be inside the for loop so here we</p>
<p>436<br>00:42:37,760 –&gt; 00:42:44,800<br>can print I right that’s a reasonable thing to print out and maybe we’ll see exactly what values</p>
<p>437<br>00:42:44,800 –&gt; 00:42:50,559<br>of I we are adding because we know the summing works right we just wrote the program on the previous</p>
<p>438<br>00:42:50,559 –&gt; 00:42:58,159<br>line or previous slide so we got 347 which is a little confusing let’s make our print statement be</p>
<p>439<br>00:42:58,159 –&gt; 00:43:06,879<br>a little bit better i equals comma and then print the actual value of i so what do you guys notice</p>
<p>440<br>00:43:06,879 –&gt; 00:43:14,559<br>i is 3 i is 4 and then it prints the sum 7 what’s the problem with this code yeah</p>
<p>441<br>00:43:17,839 –&gt; 00:43:25,119<br>yeah we’re not adding 5 right we’re we’re just adding 3 0 originally plus 3 plus 4 and we’ve</p>
<p>442<br>00:43:25,119 –&gt; 00:43:36,559<br>never added 5 so how can we fix that yeah we can do n plus 1 exactly so the range remember grabs the</p>
<p>443<br>00:43:36,559 –&gt; 00:43:44,639<br>oh plus one the range grabs these values you know as as numbers that it’s working with so start is</p>
<p>444<br>00:43:44,639 –&gt; 00:43:51,679<br>okay end is okay but we go up to but not including end right so if we go to n plus 1 we’re going to go</p>
<p>445<br>00:43:51,679 –&gt; 00:44:01,039<br>up to but not including n plus 1 so if we run it now it looks much better so we’ve got i is 3 i’s</p>
<p>446<br>00:44:01,039 –&gt; 00:44:13,039<br>4 i’s 5 and the sum is 12 per so print statements very useful when debugging code questions about</p>
<p>447<br>00:44:13,039 –&gt; 00:44:22,880<br>this one or was this is this makes sense okay um the last slide i want to do before we do a summary</p>
<p>448<br>00:44:22,880 –&gt; 00:44:29,679<br>is just to show you that factorial code we saw using a while loop a few slides back so it looks</p>
<p>449<br>00:44:29,679 –&gt; 00:44:34,559<br>really verbose right we kind of to think about it for a while before we realize what it’s actually</p>
<p>450<br>00:44:34,559 –&gt; 00:44:39,920<br>doing um but it was you know calculating the factorial obviously good variable names helped us</p>
<p>451<br>00:44:39,920 –&gt; 00:44:47,599<br>figure that out that same code in a for loop looks like this where the for loop looks like this so</p>
<p>452<br>00:44:47,599 –&gt; 00:44:53,599<br>we still have the initialization of x to 4 we still initialize our factorial right our running</p>
<p>453<br>00:44:53,599 –&gt; 00:45:01,760<br>product uh to a 1 but we’re losing that those the four lines of code that kind of make up that</p>
<p>454<br>00:45:01,760 –&gt; 00:45:09,360<br>pattern of uh changing numbers with while loops into two so this line i equals 1 this while loop</p>
<p>455<br>00:45:09,360 –&gt; 00:45:16,720<br>with the conditional and this incrementing of i become the for loop and that’s it the for loop</p>
<p>456<br>00:45:16,720 –&gt; 00:45:22,800<br>takes care of all of that the initialization the increment and going up to but not including</p>
<p>457<br>00:45:23,840 –&gt; 00:45:29,760<br>the the last value right x plus 1 so we’re going to take multiply the factorial with one then two</p>
<p>458<br>00:45:29,760 –&gt; 00:45:39,280<br>then three then four all the way up to and including x okay so the big idea about for loops</p>
<p>459<br>00:45:39,280 –&gt; 00:45:44,720<br>is they’re going to repeat however long the sequences right so you’re able to repeat certain code</p>
<p>460<br>00:45:44,720 –&gt; 00:45:49,040<br>a set number of times which is really useful in some situations while loops were useful in</p>
<p>461<br>00:45:49,040 –&gt; 00:45:54,560<br>situations where you didn’t know how many times you might want to repeat um the code so quick summary</p>
<p>462<br>00:45:54,560 –&gt; 00:46:00,800<br>we saw some looping mechanisms today it was a lot of syntax i know but the finger exercises for</p>
<p>463<br>00:46:00,800 –&gt; 00:46:07,920<br>today will certainly help m it x um also has extra help um extra exercises it’s really important to</p>
<p>464<br>00:46:08,480 –&gt; 00:46:13,840<br>to do them just to get the mental model for how exactly these loops work right and how they how they</p>
<p>465<br>00:46:14,480 –&gt; 00:46:19,360<br>how they assign variables and how they do the checks behind the scenes right and it’ll help you get</p>
<p>466<br>00:46:19,360 –&gt; 00:46:26,079<br>faster at at writing code and at doing quizzes as well okay so that’s it for today</p>
<p>467<br>00:46:37,920 –&gt; 00:46:40,900<br>you</p>
