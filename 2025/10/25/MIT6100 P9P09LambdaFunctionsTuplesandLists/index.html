                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:16,679<br>So today we’re going to wrap up talking about functions by talking about these things called</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:16,679 –&gt; 00:00:20,800<br>Lambda Functions as a way for us to create anonymous functions.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:20,800 –&gt; 00:00:27,679<br>And that will pretty much finish our exploration into creating functions.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:27,679 –&gt; 00:00:33,519<br>And the last part of the lecture we’re going to introduce new object types, tuples and lists.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:33,519 –&gt; 00:00:38,240<br>So let’s remember what we did last time.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:38,240 –&gt; 00:00:39,759<br>We ended with this example.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:39,759 –&gt; 00:00:42,000<br>We created a function.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:42,000 –&gt; 00:00:45,480<br>You guys wrote it for me and then we kind of wrote it and debugged it together.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:45,480 –&gt; 00:00:48,280<br>But we created this function called apply.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:48,280 –&gt; 00:00:55,159<br>So what was interesting about this function is that one of its parameters was a function</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:55,159 –&gt; 00:00:57,280<br>and the other one was an integer.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:57,280 –&gt; 00:01:02,760<br>And that seemed a little strange at first, but not when we realized that functions in Python</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,760 –&gt; 00:01:05,040<br>are actually just objects.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:05,040 –&gt; 00:01:09,920<br>And so they have a name, which means that anywhere where we use other kinds of objects,</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:09,920 –&gt; 00:01:13,599<br>like integers, floats, we can use them as parameters to functions.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:13,599 –&gt; 00:01:19,079<br>We can use other functions as parameters to functions as well.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:19,079 –&gt; 00:01:25,359<br>So here criteria we had just used it as a variable name, assuming that the type of criteria</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:25,359 –&gt; 00:01:26,959<br>is a function.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:26,959 –&gt; 00:01:33,159<br>According to this documentation, we assume that it takes in a number and returns a Boolean.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:33,159 –&gt; 00:01:37,079<br>So we just wrote the body of the function, assuming that that is true.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:37,079 –&gt; 00:01:42,280<br>So right here is where we used this function named criteria.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:42,280 –&gt; 00:01:44,280<br>We assumed that it takes in an integer.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:44,280 –&gt; 00:01:47,680<br>So we passed in the loop variable i as an integer.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:47,680 –&gt; 00:01:49,400<br>And we assumed it returns a Boolean.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:49,400 –&gt; 00:01:54,280<br>So we were able to use the return of criteria, parentheses i, just as a Boolean inside</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:54,280 –&gt; 00:01:57,200<br>my, as my condition for this if statement.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:57,200 –&gt; 00:02:01,519<br>So hopefully you got a chance to look through this example from last lecture.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:01,519 –&gt; 00:02:05,599<br>So that’s the definition of this function that takes in another function as a parameter.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:05,599 –&gt; 00:02:09,080<br>And then the way we use the function is down here.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:09,080 –&gt; 00:02:12,439<br>So apply is us making our function call.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:12,439 –&gt; 00:02:17,159<br>And then the first parameter is the name of a function and the second parameter is an integer.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:17,159 –&gt; 00:02:22,280<br>So the name of the function we’re running is this object that we defined over here.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:22,280 –&gt; 00:02:24,120<br>Okay?</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:24,120 –&gt; 00:02:27,039<br>Hopefully this is just review.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:27,039 –&gt; 00:02:33,680<br>Now what’s interesting about this example is that this is even function is pretty simple.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:33,680 –&gt; 00:02:36,080<br>It’s basically a one liner.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:36,080 –&gt; 00:02:39,680<br>It doesn’t do any computations inside the function body.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:39,680 –&gt; 00:02:46,920<br>It basically just takes in a value, an input, and returns something.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:46,920 –&gt; 00:02:52,920<br>And so we didn’t really need to create a function, a full-fledged function definition,</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:52,919 –&gt; 00:02:55,559<br>just to do this really simple task.</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:55,559 –&gt; 00:02:58,159<br>And in fact, that’s what a Lambda function is.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:58,159 –&gt; 00:03:02,919<br>It’s basically a way for us to create an anonymous function, a function that does something</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:02,919 –&gt; 00:03:06,879<br>really simple, but we just don’t give it a name.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:06,879 –&gt; 00:03:07,879<br>Okay?</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:07,879 –&gt; 00:03:13,759<br>And so here is the function that we created with an actual definition up here.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:13,759 –&gt; 00:03:17,919<br>We can create an equivalent anonymous function that looks like this.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:17,919 –&gt; 00:03:22,839<br>So this is a much more concise way for us to create a really simple function that we</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:22,839 –&gt; 00:03:25,280<br>only need to use one time.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:25,280 –&gt; 00:03:30,560<br>So here is, I’m going to just map out sort of one by one the important pieces of the Lambda</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:30,560 –&gt; 00:03:31,799<br>function.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:31,799 –&gt; 00:03:38,239<br>So the Lambda keyword starts out the anonymous function and it tells Python that we’re creating</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:38,239 –&gt; 00:03:40,039<br>this anonymous function.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:40,039 –&gt; 00:03:41,959<br>So Lambda’s not the name of the function.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:41,959 –&gt; 00:03:47,479<br>It just tells Python we’re going to create this function in one line that is nameless.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:47,479 –&gt; 00:03:51,159<br>This is going to be any parameters that we expect this function to take.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:51,159 –&gt; 00:03:54,399<br>So if we have more than one, we just separate them with commas.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:54,399 –&gt; 00:03:56,199<br>Colon is again the same.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:56,199 –&gt; 00:04:01,839<br>And then the body of the function, if you can write it in one liner that’s not too complicated,</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:01,839 –&gt; 00:04:03,519<br>you can make a Lambda function out of it.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:03,519 –&gt; 00:04:07,879<br>So here, notice we don’t actually have a return keyword when we’re creating the Lambda</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:07,879 –&gt; 00:04:08,879<br>function.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:08,879 –&gt; 00:04:13,599<br>We’re just doing the operation that we wish to return the value from.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:13,599 –&gt; 00:04:14,599<br>Okay?</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:14,599 –&gt; 00:04:20,319<br>So that’s percent two equal to zero is basically the body of my Lambda function over here.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:20,319 –&gt; 00:04:24,879<br>So the key thing about Lambda functions is that it allows you to create a really quick function</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:24,879 –&gt; 00:04:27,959<br>object that you basically want to use only one time.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:27,959 –&gt; 00:04:30,439<br>And so we’re not giving it a name.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:30,439 –&gt; 00:04:32,279<br>So let’s look at the code.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:32,279 –&gt; 00:04:36,199<br>So here is my apply function that we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:36,199 –&gt; 00:04:37,399<br>Here is us.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:37,399 –&gt; 00:04:38,560<br>I showed you this last time.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:38,560 –&gt; 00:04:43,159<br>I created another definition for another simple function that takes in an integer and returns</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:43,159 –&gt; 00:04:44,319<br>a Boolean.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:44,319 –&gt; 00:04:49,519<br>In this case, this function just tells me whether that input is equal to five.</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:49,519 –&gt; 00:04:51,680<br>And this is kind of where we left off.</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:51,680 –&gt; 00:04:55,800<br>Last time we ran apply with this is five function.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:55,800 –&gt; 00:04:59,159<br>So that prints apply with is five is one.</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:59,159 –&gt; 00:05:07,000<br>There’s only one integer between zero and ten where applying this returns true.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:07,000 –&gt; 00:05:10,800<br>Now with an anonymous function, just to show you how we would write a Lambda function for</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:10,800 –&gt; 00:05:14,039<br>this is underscore five, it would look like this.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:14,040 –&gt; 00:05:16,760<br>So again, we tell Python we’re creating an anonymous function.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:16,760 –&gt; 00:05:22,480<br>It has just the one input x, colon, null return, and just the body of the function is going</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:22,480 –&gt; 00:05:27,600<br>to be the thing that we would like to return, x equal five.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:27,600 –&gt; 00:05:31,280<br>So again, this notice, we’re not actually passing in the name.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:31,280 –&gt; 00:05:35,960<br>There is no name for this anonymous function, but it works in the exact same way as if we</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:35,960 –&gt; 00:05:40,600<br>had created this function over here.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:40,600 –&gt; 00:05:45,760<br>And just to sort of bring that, and I can run it again, and you can see it apply with</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:45,760 –&gt; 00:05:47,720<br>the function name is one, right?</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:47,720 –&gt; 00:05:52,760<br>And obviously apply with this anonymous function also returns one.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:52,760 –&gt; 00:05:58,800<br>So just to bring the point home, I want to show you one other way to think of these anonymous</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:58,800 –&gt; 00:06:00,040<br>functions.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:00,040 –&gt; 00:06:07,439<br>So here is me calling my is even function with a parameter eight.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:07,439 –&gt; 00:06:13,360<br>Now in order for me to actually run it, run this line here, I had to have the function</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:13,360 –&gt; 00:06:15,519<br>definition way up here.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:15,519 –&gt; 00:06:19,439<br>But again, it’s a really simple function if I only want to use it one time.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:19,439 –&gt; 00:06:22,160<br>I can create a Lambda function.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:22,160 –&gt; 00:06:31,240<br>And this over here is equivalent to this function definition and a function definition over</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:31,240 –&gt; 00:06:36,600<br>here.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:36,600 –&gt; 00:06:39,200<br>So you can think of this line over here.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:39,200 –&gt; 00:06:44,200<br>So the part that I’ve highlighted as sort of creating the definition all in one line, not</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:44,200 –&gt; 00:06:46,280<br>giving in a name.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:46,280 –&gt; 00:06:52,200<br>And then the parentheses here is us calling those lines of code for that function definition</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:52,200 –&gt; 00:06:55,680<br>with that parameter eight.</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:55,680 –&gt; 00:06:59,960<br>And so the usefulness of Lambda functions is when you want to create these really quick</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:59,960 –&gt; 00:07:03,080<br>functions that you don’t want to reuse.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:03,079 –&gt; 00:07:10,599<br>Obviously if we wanted to reuse the functionality of this is even, but we created it using a Lambda</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:10,599 –&gt; 00:07:15,959<br>function, we would have to basically copy this line and paste it all over again.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:15,959 –&gt; 00:07:22,639<br>So we’d have to take this, copy it, paste it, and give it another input.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:22,639 –&gt; 00:07:27,599<br>Because this Lambda function does not actually create it in memory with a name.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:27,600 –&gt; 00:07:34,600<br>There’s no way for us to access the body because it’s nameless.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:34,600 –&gt; 00:07:36,760<br>Okay.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:36,760 –&gt; 00:07:44,800<br>So when we, so just to finish how we call Lambda functions, so basically when we called apply</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:44,800 –&gt; 00:07:47,840<br>is even 10.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:47,840 –&gt; 00:07:54,439<br>The equivalent to calling that function name, but with a Lambda function is basically putting</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:54,439 –&gt; 00:07:59,240<br>in the entire body of the Lambda function inside this other function call.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:59,240 –&gt; 00:08:08,920<br>So here we’re both defining and then telling Python that this is my input to the function.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:08,920 –&gt; 00:08:09,920<br>Okay.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:09,920 –&gt; 00:08:15,079<br>So I know this is a U-triot, but I thought that we would actually run through it together</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:15,079 –&gt; 00:08:18,879<br>step by step on the next few slides.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:18,879 –&gt; 00:08:20,959<br>So let’s try to understand what this is doing.</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:20,959 –&gt; 00:08:24,360<br>I’ve got a function definition named due twice.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:24,360 –&gt; 00:08:27,960<br>It takes in one input, another input.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:27,960 –&gt; 00:08:33,639<br>But if we look at the body here, this Fn, that’s the input, is actually being called like</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:33,639 –&gt; 00:08:36,759<br>a function inside the body.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:36,759 –&gt; 00:08:44,200<br>So we can immediately tell that Fn is going to be a function when we actually make the</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:44,200 –&gt; 00:08:46,039<br>call to due twice.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:46,039 –&gt; 00:08:52,399<br>And indeed when we make the call to due twice down here, N is mapped to three and the</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:52,399 –&gt; 00:08:59,720<br>second parameter Fn is mapped to this anonymous Lambda function.</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:59,720 –&gt; 00:09:04,799<br>So let’s step through a little by little in the same manner that we learned last lecture.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:04,799 –&gt; 00:09:10,399<br>So creating actual environments, whatever we see a function call, mapping parameters, actual</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:10,399 –&gt; 00:09:17,159<br>parameters to formal parameters and following through on what exactly happens within each</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:17,159 –&gt; 00:09:19,399<br>function body.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:19,399 –&gt; 00:09:24,039<br>So when we first make the function call, right, or sorry, when we first run this program,</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:24,039 –&gt; 00:09:31,079<br>if it has these sort of three lines of code inside it, Python creates our global environment.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:31,079 –&gt; 00:09:35,279<br>Inside the environment, we’ve got one function definition here, so this is going to be this</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:35,279 –&gt; 00:09:37,600<br>function object.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:37,600 –&gt; 00:09:44,519<br>And then I’ve got the thing that actually kicks off my function calls, my program.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:44,519 –&gt; 00:09:49,240<br>So I’ve got a print statement that will print the result of doing something.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:49,240 –&gt; 00:09:53,960<br>So the first thing I can see here is that I’ve got a function call to due twice, right?</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:53,960 –&gt; 00:09:55,840<br>So I’m going left to right.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:55,840 –&gt; 00:10:01,200<br>The first thing I knew when I have a function call is I create a new environment.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:01,200 –&gt; 00:10:06,159<br>Inside this environment of due twice, I have to see what it takes in, what are its formal</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:06,159 –&gt; 00:10:07,159<br>parameters?</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:07,159 –&gt; 00:10:10,680<br>There’s one called N and one called Fn.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:10,680 –&gt; 00:10:13,799<br>So there’s one parameter N and the other one Fn.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:13,799 –&gt; 00:10:20,479<br>And now I basically map one by one the formal parameter to the actual parameter.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:20,479 –&gt; 00:10:24,599<br>So the N gets mapped to the three because that’s the first parameter of due twice and</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:24,599 –&gt; 00:10:28,879<br>the Fn gets mapped to this function object here, right?</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:28,879 –&gt; 00:10:31,639<br>So the Fn gets mapped to this lambda function here.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:31,639 –&gt; 00:10:36,240<br>Okay, that’s exactly what I said.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:36,240 –&gt; 00:10:38,039<br>So we’ve done the mapping.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:38,039 –&gt; 00:10:41,719<br>And now that we’ve done the mapping, we can do the body of due twice.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:41,720 –&gt; 00:10:50,279<br>So the body of due twice says return and then I have to replace everywhere I see Fn with</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:50,279 –&gt; 00:10:57,879<br>this lambda function and everywhere I see N with this three.</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:57,879 –&gt; 00:11:01,800<br>Well, Fn is going to be a function call, right?</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:01,800 –&gt; 00:11:05,639<br>Whenever we see a function call, we need to create a function scope.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:05,639 –&gt; 00:11:11,680<br>So before I can do the return, before this due twice can terminate, can return its value,</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:11,679 –&gt; 00:11:13,719<br>it sees a function call.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:13,719 –&gt; 00:11:16,799<br>So when there’s a function call, we need to create another scope, right?</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:16,799 –&gt; 00:11:19,679<br>Another environment.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:19,679 –&gt; 00:11:25,759<br>This environment belongs to the function call of lambda x colon x squared.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:25,759 –&gt; 00:11:26,519<br>Right?</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:26,519 –&gt; 00:11:28,799<br>Now this function, of course, doesn’t have a name.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:28,799 –&gt; 00:11:33,479<br>Normally I would say, you know, this is the F environment or this is the G environment or</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:33,479 –&gt; 00:11:34,679<br>that is even environment.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:34,679 –&gt; 00:11:36,399<br>But there’s no name for this one.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:36,399 –&gt; 00:11:39,599<br>So I’m just going to write up here the body of that function.</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:40,600 –&gt; 00:11:41,399<br>All right.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:41,399 –&gt; 00:11:51,000<br>Well, in this function, again, following sort of the rules one by one, what we need to do is figure out what are the parameters of this function.</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:51,000 –&gt; 00:11:54,000<br>Well, there’s one called x.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:54,000 –&gt; 00:12:00,399<br>So here’s my parameter x and then I need to figure out what does this map to?</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:00,399 –&gt; 00:12:06,040<br>Well, what it maps to is the parameter inside it.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:06,039 –&gt; 00:12:11,599<br>But the parameter inside it is fn parentheses n.</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:11,599 –&gt; 00:12:14,839<br>Do we have a return value for this yet?</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:14,839 –&gt; 00:12:15,799<br>No, right?</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:15,799 –&gt; 00:12:18,839<br>Because this is another function call.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:18,839 –&gt; 00:12:29,480<br>So what ends up happening is this environment gets put on hold as well because we can’t figure out what parameter this lambda function takes in.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:29,480 –&gt; 00:12:31,079<br>What is its value?</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:31,080 –&gt; 00:12:36,080<br>So we create another scope, another environment.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:36,080 –&gt; 00:12:46,280<br>And in this particular case, this one is going to belong to this inside bit here, fn parentheses n.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:46,280 –&gt; 00:12:52,759<br>So this lambda xx squared is going to be the exact same function again, being called again.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:52,759 –&gt; 00:12:57,320<br>And in this particular environment, we need to map x to its input.</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:57,320 –&gt; 00:13:04,160<br>So the input to x, sorry, to this lambda xx squared is going to be n.</p>
<p>184<br>00:13:04,160 –&gt; 00:13:08,600<br>Well, this environment doesn’t know about n, so we pop up one level.</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:08,600 –&gt; 00:13:11,080<br>This environment knows about n, it’s three.</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:11,080 –&gt; 00:13:18,640<br>So it passes that value along down to this lambda, lambda call.</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:18,640 –&gt; 00:13:25,840<br>So now that this inner sort of highlight yellow over here knows what it needs to do.</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:25,840 –&gt; 00:13:28,680<br>It needs to take in this x and return x squared.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:28,680 –&gt; 00:13:33,960<br>So it calculates 9 and then returns 9 to whoever called it.</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:33,960 –&gt; 00:13:42,639<br>That 9 gets replaced now as the input to this outer fn.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:42,639 –&gt; 00:13:50,519<br>So just to show you exactly what gets replaced, that entire function call there gets replaced with 9.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:50,519 –&gt; 00:13:54,759<br>As soon as we’ve done the return, that environment goes away.</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:54,759 –&gt; 00:14:00,039<br>And at this point, this call to lambda xx squared can terminate as well,</p>
<p>194<br>00:14:00,039 –&gt; 00:14:05,399<br>because it takes in the number 9 and it returns 9 squared.</p>
<p>195<br>00:14:05,399 –&gt; 00:14:07,519<br>So this one returns 81.</p>
<p>196<br>00:14:07,519 –&gt; 00:14:11,960<br>So this entire function call is 81.</p>
<p>197<br>00:14:11,960 –&gt; 00:14:15,240<br>And as soon as it returns, that environment goes away.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:15,240 –&gt; 00:14:20,559<br>And now do twice can finally finish its job and return 81.</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:20,559 –&gt; 00:14:23,679<br>It just basically passes this value along back up.</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:23,679 –&gt; 00:14:25,719<br>So that returns 81.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:25,719 –&gt; 00:14:29,759<br>So this entire do twice call is going to be 81.</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:29,759 –&gt; 00:14:35,120<br>Why does lambda, why would there be two from again?</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:35,120 –&gt; 00:14:40,039<br>There were two of them because this outer fn calls an inner fn.</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:40,039 –&gt; 00:14:42,079<br>So we, yeah.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:45,799 –&gt; 00:14:49,399<br>OK, so that wraps up our discussion on functions.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:49,399 –&gt; 00:14:53,359<br>And there’s a couple exercises in this, the Python file associate with this lecture,</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:53,360 –&gt; 00:14:58,279<br>with lambda functions, just so you can give it a try with those.</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:58,279 –&gt; 00:14:59,279<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:59,279 –&gt; 00:15:00,279<br>Question.</p>
<p>210<br>00:15:00,279 –&gt; 00:15:05,560<br>The lambda function is the use of a function, you can use that.</p>
<p>211<br>00:15:05,560 –&gt; 00:15:08,000<br>Well, apply was just a function that I wrote.</p>
<p>212<br>00:15:08,000 –&gt; 00:15:15,320<br>So in this new example, I was just printing the result of calling that function.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:15,320 –&gt; 00:15:17,480<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>214<br>00:15:17,480 –&gt; 00:15:21,360<br>So again, this kind of trace of what happens throughout the program is really,</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:21,360 –&gt; 00:15:22,159<br>really useful.</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:22,159 –&gt; 00:15:28,079<br>So if you have some time to try to get that down, it will be very, very helpful as you trace</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:28,079 –&gt; 00:15:31,399<br>through some programs.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:31,399 –&gt; 00:15:36,079<br>OK, so that ends our discussion on functions.</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:36,079 –&gt; 00:15:40,639<br>And really, the only syntax we’ve introduced in the past couple lectures were just about</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:40,639 –&gt; 00:15:44,079<br>how to wrap code we’ve already been using in a function.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:44,079 –&gt; 00:15:50,159<br>So not much new syntax, but today we’re going to introduce some new syntax along with</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:50,159 –&gt; 00:15:52,559<br>the introduction of two new data types.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:52,559 –&gt; 00:15:56,639<br>One is called a two-pole and the other one is called a list.</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:56,639 –&gt; 00:15:59,240<br>So what are the data types we’ve seen so far?</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:59,240 –&gt; 00:16:02,719<br>We’ve seen integers, floats, basically numbers.</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:02,719 –&gt; 00:16:04,679<br>We’ve seen Booleans’ truth values.</p>
<p>227<br>00:16:04,679 –&gt; 00:16:08,799<br>We’ve seen this none type, type which has one value none.</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:08,799 –&gt; 00:16:12,120<br>And we actually also saw the string data type, right?</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:12,120 –&gt; 00:16:16,600<br>We could think of the string data type as sort of a compound data type, like a sequence</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:16,600 –&gt; 00:16:18,639<br>of single characters.</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:18,639 –&gt; 00:16:23,519<br>And in fact, we were using that string in that way because we were able to index into</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:23,519 –&gt; 00:16:28,960<br>the string to grab the character at index zero, sort of slice the substring, right, to get</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:28,960 –&gt; 00:16:31,360<br>the length of the string.</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:31,360 –&gt; 00:16:33,919<br>Today we’re going to introduce two more compound data types.</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:33,919 –&gt; 00:16:36,919<br>So these things called two-poles and these things called lists.</p>
<p>236<br>00:16:36,919 –&gt; 00:16:43,439<br>And throughout the lecture, you should really think about how it’s very, very similar to</p>
<p>237<br>00:16:43,439 –&gt; 00:16:46,919<br>the strings that we’ve already seen.</p>
<p>238<br>00:16:46,919 –&gt; 00:16:53,919<br>So a lot of the operations, I’m actually going to skip aside from sort of the syntax of</p>
<p>239<br>00:16:53,919 –&gt; 00:16:57,279<br>how we denote a two-pole or a list.</p>
<p>240<br>00:16:57,279 –&gt; 00:17:01,079<br>Really the operations that we do with two-poles and lists are going to be exactly the same as</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:01,079 –&gt; 00:17:03,120<br>the ones that we did with strings, right?</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:03,120 –&gt; 00:17:07,519<br>So if you understand indexing and slicing and getting the length of the string, all that</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:07,519 –&gt; 00:17:11,559<br>stuff, you’ll understand how to do that for two-poles and lists.</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:11,559 –&gt; 00:17:16,519<br>All right, so two-poles are indexable ordered sequences of objects.</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:16,519 –&gt; 00:17:19,839<br>That’s kind of a lot, so we can break that down.</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:19,839 –&gt; 00:17:24,639<br>So first of all, it’s a sequence of objects, just like a string was a sequence of single</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:24,639 –&gt; 00:17:25,639<br>characters.</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:25,639 –&gt; 00:17:32,799<br>A two-pole is going to be a sequence of not just characters, but any kind of object.</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:32,799 –&gt; 00:17:36,639<br>Ordered sequence means that there will be an order to this sequence.</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:36,639 –&gt; 00:17:40,839<br>So there’s going to be an object at the first position in my two-pole, an object at the</p>
<p>251<br>00:17:40,839 –&gt; 00:17:44,480<br>second position in my two-pole, and so on, just like there was a character at the first</p>
<p>252<br>00:17:44,480 –&gt; 00:17:47,519<br>position, character at the second position, and so on.</p>
<p>253<br>00:17:47,519 –&gt; 00:17:53,000<br>And indexable ordered sequence means that we can index into this object, so we can grab</p>
<p>254<br>00:17:53,000 –&gt; 00:17:59,480<br>the element at index zero, grab the element index one, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>255<br>00:17:59,480 –&gt; 00:18:03,160<br>So how do we create these two-poles?</p>
<p>256<br>00:18:03,160 –&gt; 00:18:08,559<br>I should note that some people call them tuples because they’re just kind of like an end-tuple</p>
<p>257<br>00:18:08,559 –&gt; 00:18:12,519<br>kind of thing, so you can call them tuples or tuples however you’d like.</p>
<p>258<br>00:18:13,039 –&gt; 00:18:17,400<br>All right, so how do we create these tuple objects?</p>
<p>259<br>00:18:17,400 –&gt; 00:18:24,400<br>Well, we can create a tuple object that’s empty using just open and closed parentheses.</p>
<p>260<br>00:18:24,400 –&gt; 00:18:29,720<br>So we could create strings using just sort of the open and closed quotation marks.</p>
<p>261<br>00:18:29,720 –&gt; 00:18:33,359<br>We create an empty tuple by doing open and closed parentheses.</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:33,359 –&gt; 00:18:36,279<br>Now this is different than functions, right?</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:36,279 –&gt; 00:18:39,839<br>This is a little bit similar, or might be a bit confusing because we use parentheses</p>
<p>264<br>00:18:39,919 –&gt; 00:18:44,720<br>to make function calls, but notice it’s just the parentheses by themselves, right?</p>
<p>265<br>00:18:44,720 –&gt; 00:18:48,399<br>There’s no function name, nothing preceding the parentheses.</p>
<p>266<br>00:18:48,399 –&gt; 00:18:53,519<br>So to Python, it’s not going to be confusing when you just do this.</p>
<p>267<br>00:18:53,519 –&gt; 00:18:59,519<br>You can create a tuple with one element in it by putting open, closed parentheses that</p>
<p>268<br>00:18:59,519 –&gt; 00:19:04,599<br>element that you want to add to your tuple and then a comma right after it.</p>
<p>269<br>00:19:04,599 –&gt; 00:19:11,599<br>Now the comma is there to differentiate a tuple with one element from sort of using parentheses</p>
<p>270<br>00:19:15,319 –&gt; 00:19:18,279<br>as precedents over an operation.</p>
<p>271<br>00:19:18,279 –&gt; 00:19:25,119<br>So just as an example, if I create a is equal to five like this, right, I’m using parentheses</p>
<p>272<br>00:19:25,119 –&gt; 00:19:30,480<br>around an integer, but the type of a is still an integer.</p>
<p>273<br>00:19:30,480 –&gt; 00:19:36,799<br>I’m basically just using the parentheses to say I want to do this five before doing</p>
<p>274<br>00:19:36,799 –&gt; 00:19:42,519<br>anything else, which is a little strange to do, and the value of a is five.</p>
<p>275<br>00:19:42,519 –&gt; 00:19:49,839<br>But if I do b is equal to the tuple for comma, this tells Python that this is now a sequence</p>
<p>276<br>00:19:49,839 –&gt; 00:19:53,720<br>of objects, but there’s just one object in my sequence.</p>
<p>277<br>00:19:53,720 –&gt; 00:20:01,120<br>So the type of b is a tuple, not an integer.</p>
<p>278<br>00:20:01,120 –&gt; 00:20:05,759<br>And if I say ask what b is, you can see it’s for comma in parentheses.</p>
<p>279<br>00:20:05,759 –&gt; 00:20:10,920<br>So it’s a tuple with one object in it.</p>
<p>280<br>00:20:10,920 –&gt; 00:20:18,620<br>Okay, so to create a tuple with many objects in it, we basically put in parentheses all</p>
<p>281<br>00:20:18,620 –&gt; 00:20:22,000<br>the objects I want to add in my tuple separated by commas.</p>
<p>282<br>00:20:22,000 –&gt; 00:20:27,759<br>So here I’ve got my first element in my tuple integer two, second element in the tuple</p>
<p>283<br>00:20:27,759 –&gt; 00:20:32,440<br>the string of my t, and the third element in my tuple being the integer three.</p>
<p>284<br>00:20:32,440 –&gt; 00:20:37,839<br>And notice we can mix and match now objects of different types within my tuple object.</p>
<p>285<br>00:20:37,839 –&gt; 00:20:41,319<br>So here I’ve got integers and strings and integers.</p>
<p>286<br>00:20:41,319 –&gt; 00:20:45,960<br>I can even add floats and booleans and whatever object types I’d like, I can make them elements</p>
<p>287<br>00:20:45,960 –&gt; 00:20:51,480<br>to my tuple, which is pretty cool, right, different than strings in that respect, but still,</p>
<p>288<br>00:20:51,480 –&gt; 00:20:55,519<br>you know, in order within my tuple.</p>
<p>289<br>00:20:55,519 –&gt; 00:21:00,799<br>And so the rest of this is actually operations that we’ve already seen on strings.</p>
<p>290<br>00:21:00,799 –&gt; 00:21:03,759<br>So I’m not going to go through them in too much detail.</p>
<p>291<br>00:21:03,759 –&gt; 00:21:09,000<br>We can use the square bracket to index into the tuple, so to grab the element at a particular</p>
<p>292<br>00:21:09,000 –&gt; 00:21:12,519<br>index, again indexing starts from zero.</p>
<p>293<br>00:21:12,519 –&gt; 00:21:18,200<br>We can use a plus operator to concatenate two tuples together to create one larger tuple</p>
<p>294<br>00:21:18,200 –&gt; 00:21:21,640<br>with all those elements in a row.</p>
<p>295<br>00:21:21,640 –&gt; 00:21:24,440<br>We can slice down here.</p>
<p>296<br>00:21:24,440 –&gt; 00:21:28,640<br>We can get the length of the tuple, which tells us how many elements are in it, so three</p>
<p>297<br>00:21:28,640 –&gt; 00:21:30,400<br>elements.</p>
<p>298<br>00:21:30,400 –&gt; 00:21:37,160<br>We can use the max, min, sum, things like that to grab the maximum element and minimum</p>
<p>299<br>00:21:37,160 –&gt; 00:21:40,880<br>element, sum all the elements of my tuple and things like that.</p>
<p>300<br>00:21:40,880 –&gt; 00:21:45,080<br>Notice that here I’ve got parentheses for the max function call.</p>
<p>301<br>00:21:45,079 –&gt; 00:21:50,480<br>And then another set of parentheses here to denote that I have one tuple object I’d like</p>
<p>302<br>00:21:50,480 –&gt; 00:21:55,000<br>to grab the max of.</p>
<p>303<br>00:21:55,000 –&gt; 00:21:59,480<br>And then the last bit here is something that we’re going to see that’s different with lists</p>
<p>304<br>00:21:59,480 –&gt; 00:22:02,279<br>in the next lecture, not today.</p>
<p>305<br>00:22:02,279 –&gt; 00:22:07,639<br>But basically, you might think that once you create this tuple object in memory, right,</p>
<p>306<br>00:22:07,639 –&gt; 00:22:13,319<br>that has two MIT-3 as its three elements in it, you can go into memory and modify one of</p>
<p>307<br>00:22:13,319 –&gt; 00:22:14,319<br>the elements, right?</p>
<p>308<br>00:22:14,319 –&gt; 00:22:17,519<br>Like if I don’t want the middle one to be a string and want it to be a common integer,</p>
<p>309<br>00:22:17,519 –&gt; 00:22:20,919<br>you might think that you should be able to change it.</p>
<p>310<br>00:22:20,919 –&gt; 00:22:26,319<br>You can with lists, as we’ll see in the next lecture, but you cannot do this with tuples.</p>
<p>311<br>00:22:26,319 –&gt; 00:22:32,559<br>Just like once we created sort of an integer five inside memory, we can’t go into memory</p>
<p>312<br>00:22:32,559 –&gt; 00:22:35,639<br>and tell Python to change this five to a six.</p>
<p>313<br>00:22:35,639 –&gt; 00:22:37,000<br>It’s just not allowed.</p>
<p>314<br>00:22:37,000 –&gt; 00:22:40,879<br>Or once we created a string, a, b, c, and memory, you can’t go into memory and change</p>
<p>315<br>00:22:40,879 –&gt; 00:22:42,359<br>this string.</p>
<p>316<br>00:22:42,359 –&gt; 00:22:46,919<br>You can certainly create new objects that are based on this string, but you can’t go</p>
<p>317<br>00:22:46,919 –&gt; 00:22:49,959<br>in and modify that object once it’s created.</p>
<p>318<br>00:22:49,959 –&gt; 00:22:56,559<br>So once you’ve made your sequence of tuples, you cannot go in and change it.</p>
<p>319<br>00:22:56,559 –&gt; 00:22:57,559<br>So yeah.</p>
<p>320<br>00:22:57,559 –&gt; 00:23:05,479<br>If you just rewrote like t equals and then it goes into different, it would be like, there.</p>
<p>321<br>00:23:05,479 –&gt; 00:23:07,879<br>If you wrote t equals and then something different.</p>
<p>322<br>00:23:07,879 –&gt; 00:23:10,159<br>So you can’t want if I want to say.</p>
<p>323<br>00:23:10,159 –&gt; 00:23:11,639<br>Yeah, that’s a good question.</p>
<p>324<br>00:23:11,640 –&gt; 00:23:19,360<br>So the variable t, so the name t, and the object it’s bound to are two different things.</p>
<p>325<br>00:23:19,360 –&gt; 00:23:22,400<br>So the object it’s bound to will still sit in memory.</p>
<p>326<br>00:23:22,400 –&gt; 00:23:24,280<br>We’re just going to lose the binding from it.</p>
<p>327<br>00:23:24,280 –&gt; 00:23:27,040<br>So that t initially points to this one.</p>
<p>328<br>00:23:27,040 –&gt; 00:23:31,160<br>But then if you say t equals something else later on, this one still stays there, but</p>
<p>329<br>00:23:31,160 –&gt; 00:23:34,520<br>that t is going to point to this new thing.</p>
<p>330<br>00:23:34,520 –&gt; 00:23:36,840<br>So the object itself is still in memory.</p>
<p>331<br>00:23:36,840 –&gt; 00:23:38,640<br>We’ve just lost the binding to it.</p>
<p>332<br>00:23:38,640 –&gt; 00:23:42,480<br>And that’s something we did sort of way back in the first early lectures where we kind</p>
<p>333<br>00:23:42,480 –&gt; 00:23:43,840<br>of rebound variables.</p>
<p>334<br>00:23:43,840 –&gt; 00:23:44,840<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>335<br>00:23:44,840 –&gt; 00:23:50,960<br>So it’s the same idea.</p>
<p>336<br>00:23:50,960 –&gt; 00:23:55,880<br>One interesting thing that we can do now with tuples that we couldn’t with strings is</p>
<p>337<br>00:23:55,880 –&gt; 00:24:01,080<br>to have elements of a tuple be another tuple.</p>
<p>338<br>00:24:01,080 –&gt; 00:24:03,360<br>And that’s what this example is going to show.</p>
<p>339<br>00:24:03,360 –&gt; 00:24:07,120<br>So here I’ve got an integer two as my first element.</p>
<p>340<br>00:24:07,119 –&gt; 00:24:11,359<br>My second element is the string A. My third element is my integer four.</p>
<p>341<br>00:24:11,359 –&gt; 00:24:17,079<br>And my fourth element is a tuple object that just happens to have two elements inside</p>
<p>342<br>00:24:17,079 –&gt; 00:24:19,479<br>it.</p>
<p>343<br>00:24:19,479 –&gt; 00:24:28,239<br>But this tuple object that I’m referencing by a CQ, C, only has four elements in it.</p>
<p>344<br>00:24:28,239 –&gt; 00:24:31,559<br>It just so happens that the last one is a tuple.</p>
<p>345<br>00:24:31,559 –&gt; 00:24:36,679<br>But I’m not going to dive further down to figure out if I have tuples that have sub tuples,</p>
<p>346<br>00:24:36,680 –&gt; 00:24:38,600<br>and so on.</p>
<p>347<br>00:24:38,600 –&gt; 00:24:43,440<br>Only top level I care about how many elements I have.</p>
<p>348<br>00:24:43,440 –&gt; 00:24:46,680<br>And so when I print the length of seek, it’s going to be four, right?</p>
<p>349<br>00:24:46,680 –&gt; 00:24:48,560<br>Because I have one, two, three.</p>
<p>350<br>00:24:48,560 –&gt; 00:24:53,039<br>And then this last object is just one object that takes up one slot.</p>
<p>351<br>00:24:53,039 –&gt; 00:24:57,600<br>It happens to have elements within it.</p>
<p>352<br>00:24:57,600 –&gt; 00:25:02,360<br>And so the rest of these are basically what we’ve seen with strings except for this one</p>
<p>353<br>00:25:02,359 –&gt; 00:25:03,719<br>here.</p>
<p>354<br>00:25:03,719 –&gt; 00:25:11,079<br>If we were to index into the last element here of seek, 1, 2, well, this is another tuple,</p>
<p>355<br>00:25:11,079 –&gt; 00:25:12,079<br>right?</p>
<p>356<br>00:25:12,079 –&gt; 00:25:18,279<br>So it should follow that I can then take that tuple and further index into it.</p>
<p>357<br>00:25:18,279 –&gt; 00:25:22,439<br>And so that’s what this line here is doing.</p>
<p>358<br>00:25:22,439 –&gt; 00:25:24,679<br>When we read an expression, we go left to right.</p>
<p>359<br>00:25:24,679 –&gt; 00:25:29,679<br>So basically seek at index three grabs for me the 1, 2.</p>
<p>360<br>00:25:29,680 –&gt; 00:25:36,200<br>And then if I further index into 1, 2 at index zero, I’m going to grab the number one.</p>
<p>361<br>00:25:36,200 –&gt; 00:25:37,200<br>All right.</p>
<p>362<br>00:25:37,200 –&gt; 00:25:45,240<br>So I’m basically chaining all these indices indexing operations together.</p>
<p>363<br>00:25:45,240 –&gt; 00:25:49,680<br>And then this is again very similar to what we’ve seen from strings.</p>
<p>364<br>00:25:49,680 –&gt; 00:25:53,400<br>So it’s just slicing instead of indexing into the into the tuple.</p>
<p>365<br>00:25:53,400 –&gt; 00:25:56,519<br>I’m not going to go through it today.</p>
<p>366<br>00:25:56,519 –&gt; 00:26:02,039<br>But I encourage you to type them in and type in some other things as you might have done</p>
<p>367<br>00:26:02,039 –&gt; 00:26:04,839<br>with the strings.</p>
<p>368<br>00:26:04,839 –&gt; 00:26:11,839<br>One thing that I do want to mention is that we can iterate over a tuple just like we could</p>
<p>369<br>00:26:11,839 –&gt; 00:26:13,879<br>iterate over a string.</p>
<p>370<br>00:26:13,879 –&gt; 00:26:18,160<br>I don’t mean over indices, but I mean over the elements directly.</p>
<p>371<br>00:26:18,160 –&gt; 00:26:24,839<br>So when we iterate it over a string directly, we were able to grab in our loop variable the</p>
<p>372<br>00:26:24,839 –&gt; 00:26:28,159<br>characters at each index.</p>
<p>373<br>00:26:28,159 –&gt; 00:26:33,399<br>Similarly, we can iterate over a tuple to grab the elements at each index directly.</p>
<p>374<br>00:26:33,399 –&gt; 00:26:41,559<br>So here, I’ve got four e in seek is going to make my loop variable e take on each element</p>
<p>375<br>00:26:41,559 –&gt; 00:26:43,879<br>of the tuple directly.</p>
<p>376<br>00:26:43,879 –&gt; 00:26:45,679<br>Not the index, but each element.</p>
<p>377<br>00:26:45,679 –&gt; 00:26:49,480<br>So as I’m looping through, e will first have a value two.</p>
<p>378<br>00:26:49,480 –&gt; 00:26:51,159<br>Then it’ll have a value a.</p>
<p>379<br>00:26:51,159 –&gt; 00:26:52,799<br>Then it’ll have a value four.</p>
<p>380<br>00:26:52,799 –&gt; 00:26:55,919<br>And lastly, it’ll have this value one comma two.</p>
<p>381<br>00:26:55,919 –&gt; 00:27:04,799<br>So if I just print that out directly, you’ll see these values printed out.</p>
<p>382<br>00:27:04,799 –&gt; 00:27:09,440<br>So very, very similar to some of the operations we’ve done with strings, the only differences</p>
<p>383<br>00:27:09,440 –&gt; 00:27:15,159<br>we just now have to be careful that our tuples can have elements that are other tuples</p>
<p>384<br>00:27:15,159 –&gt; 00:27:19,359<br>or basically any object in Python.</p>
<p>385<br>00:27:19,359 –&gt; 00:27:21,480<br>So what do we use tuples for?</p>
<p>386<br>00:27:21,480 –&gt; 00:27:28,000<br>Well, there was this one example we did way back at the beginning of this 600L, where we</p>
<p>387<br>00:27:28,000 –&gt; 00:27:29,640<br>tried to swap variables.</p>
<p>388<br>00:27:29,640 –&gt; 00:27:34,599<br>And we basically said that this way did it work because we overwrote the variable.</p>
<p>389<br>00:27:34,599 –&gt; 00:27:38,640<br>We overwrote the variable and then we weren’t able to get back to the value that was over</p>
<p>390<br>00:27:38,640 –&gt; 00:27:39,720<br>it.</p>
<p>391<br>00:27:39,720 –&gt; 00:27:45,279<br>So our solution was to create this temporary variable to save the value before we overwrote</p>
<p>392<br>00:27:45,279 –&gt; 00:27:51,319<br>it, then overwrite the variable, and then use the temporary variable to grab that saved</p>
<p>393<br>00:27:51,319 –&gt; 00:27:52,839<br>value.</p>
<p>394<br>00:27:52,839 –&gt; 00:27:57,879<br>Well it turns out tuples actually allow us to do these three lines of code in one line</p>
<p>395<br>00:27:57,879 –&gt; 00:28:00,240<br>of code here.</p>
<p>396<br>00:28:00,240 –&gt; 00:28:05,839<br>So we can say x comma y equals y comma x.</p>
<p>397<br>00:28:05,839 –&gt; 00:28:11,359<br>So this is an assignment and it’s allowed because the left hand side is basically a set</p>
<p>398<br>00:28:11,359 –&gt; 00:28:16,000<br>of variables in sequence.</p>
<p>399<br>00:28:16,000 –&gt; 00:28:21,200<br>And the right hand side gets evaluated first as we would an assignment statement.</p>
<p>400<br>00:28:21,200 –&gt; 00:28:26,160<br>So y gets the value 2 because that’s what it is up here and x gets the value 1.</p>
<p>401<br>00:28:26,160 –&gt; 00:28:29,759<br>So y is 2x is 1 over here on the right hand side.</p>
<p>402<br>00:28:29,759 –&gt; 00:28:34,960<br>And then Python 1 at a time matches the values on the right to the values on the left,</p>
<p>403<br>00:28:34,960 –&gt; 00:28:36,840<br>separated by commas.</p>
<p>404<br>00:28:36,840 –&gt; 00:28:42,279<br>So basically what we have here is x is equal to 2, y is equal to 1, and then the values</p>
<p>405<br>00:28:42,279 –&gt; 00:28:47,120<br>have been rebounded.</p>
<p>406<br>00:28:47,119 –&gt; 00:28:53,919<br>So very, very, very useful, very good use of tuples here.</p>
<p>407<br>00:28:53,919 –&gt; 00:28:58,959<br>Now this idea can actually be taken one step further.</p>
<p>408<br>00:28:58,959 –&gt; 00:29:05,279<br>And we can use tuples to return more than one value from a function.</p>
<p>409<br>00:29:05,279 –&gt; 00:29:12,439<br>Now I know in the past couple lectures I said basically you can’t return more than one</p>
<p>410<br>00:29:12,439 –&gt; 00:29:14,599<br>thing from a function.</p>
<p>411<br>00:29:14,599 –&gt; 00:29:16,399<br>The function returns only one thing.</p>
<p>412<br>00:29:16,400 –&gt; 00:29:21,160<br>As soon as it sees a return statement, it takes the value associated with that return</p>
<p>413<br>00:29:21,160 –&gt; 00:29:25,080<br>and returns it back to whoever called it.</p>
<p>414<br>00:29:25,080 –&gt; 00:29:28,080<br>But tuples are one object.</p>
<p>415<br>00:29:28,080 –&gt; 00:29:32,920<br>They just so happen to have elements that can have different values, right?</p>
<p>416<br>00:29:32,920 –&gt; 00:29:34,680<br>You can have a tuple with 10 elements in it.</p>
<p>417<br>00:29:34,680 –&gt; 00:29:38,080<br>You can have a tuple with two elements in it.</p>
<p>418<br>00:29:38,080 –&gt; 00:29:43,680<br>Using a tuple we can actually return one object, the tuple itself.</p>
<p>419<br>00:29:43,680 –&gt; 00:29:49,519<br>It just so happens to have a whole bunch of values that my function might calculate.</p>
<p>420<br>00:29:49,519 –&gt; 00:29:55,360<br>And so by way of the tuple, I’m actually able to return a whole bunch of different values</p>
<p>421<br>00:29:55,360 –&gt; 00:29:57,400<br>through this one object tuple.</p>
<p>422<br>00:29:57,400 –&gt; 00:30:01,640<br>And so in this particular example I have a function that calculates the quotient and</p>
<p>423<br>00:30:01,640 –&gt; 00:30:06,840<br>the remainder when x is divided by y.</p>
<p>424<br>00:30:06,839 –&gt; 00:30:14,159<br>So the function itself takes in, uses integer division to find the quotient and uses the</p>
<p>425<br>00:30:14,159 –&gt; 00:30:16,919<br>remainder operator to find the remainder.</p>
<p>426<br>00:30:16,919 –&gt; 00:30:20,679<br>And then it returns that q calculation, right?</p>
<p>427<br>00:30:20,679 –&gt; 00:30:25,559<br>Some number and that r calculation, another number, as elements to a tuple.</p>
<p>428<br>00:30:25,559 –&gt; 00:30:34,199<br>And Python returns this one tuple object using this line here, returning this object.</p>
<p>429<br>00:30:34,200 –&gt; 00:30:40,400<br>And so when I make this function call to quotient and remainder 10 comma 3, it’s going to go</p>
<p>430<br>00:30:40,400 –&gt; 00:30:44,600<br>in, it’s going to calculate the quotient to be 3, the remainder to be 1.</p>
<p>431<br>00:30:44,600 –&gt; 00:30:48,680<br>And it’s going to return one object, 3 comma 1.</p>
<p>432<br>00:30:48,680 –&gt; 00:30:53,279<br>And then that gets assigned to this variable, both, that I named both in this particular</p>
<p>433<br>00:30:53,279 –&gt; 00:30:57,160<br>case.</p>
<p>434<br>00:30:57,160 –&gt; 00:31:01,960<br>If I wanted to access the quotient part of both, I would do both square bracket 0 and</p>
<p>435<br>00:31:01,960 –&gt; 00:31:06,559<br>the remainder part of both would be both square bracket 1, accessing the 0th element and</p>
<p>436<br>00:31:06,559 –&gt; 00:31:09,200<br>the first element of the return.</p>
<p>437<br>00:31:09,200 –&gt; 00:31:14,960<br>Now if I wanted to explicitly save the quotient and remainder as variables after they got</p>
<p>438<br>00:31:14,960 –&gt; 00:31:20,120<br>returned, I can actually do the trick we saw in the previous slide, right?</p>
<p>439<br>00:31:20,120 –&gt; 00:31:24,799<br>The trick we saw in the previous slide was x comma y equals some other tuple.</p>
<p>440<br>00:31:24,799 –&gt; 00:31:26,519<br>Well that’s what I’m doing here.</p>
<p>441<br>00:31:26,519 –&gt; 00:31:30,160<br>I’m making a function called a quotient and remainder 5 comma 2.</p>
<p>442<br>00:31:30,160 –&gt; 00:31:33,279<br>That’s going to return 2 comma 1.</p>
<p>443<br>00:31:33,279 –&gt; 00:31:38,120<br>And then I’m going to have quote comma rem equals 2 comma 1.</p>
<p>444<br>00:31:38,120 –&gt; 00:31:44,720<br>So Python 1 at a time is going to map the quote to 2 and the rem to 1.</p>
<p>445<br>00:31:44,720 –&gt; 00:31:51,000<br>And so what that means for us in terms of the code is we can then do whatever we’d like</p>
<p>446<br>00:31:51,000 –&gt; 00:31:53,240<br>in the remaining part of the code.</p>
<p>447<br>00:31:53,240 –&gt; 00:31:57,200<br>Code assuming that quote and rem are just regular variables.</p>
<p>448<br>00:31:57,200 –&gt; 00:32:01,640<br>So here I’m just showing that you can print them out in these print statements, right?</p>
<p>449<br>00:32:01,640 –&gt; 00:32:13,319<br>So here I have quotient is 2 and remainder is 1 as these two lines of code here.</p>
<p>450<br>00:32:13,319 –&gt; 00:32:14,319<br>Okay.</p>
<p>451<br>00:32:14,319 –&gt; 00:32:21,600<br>So the big idea of tuples, the reason why we use them is you can use them to return more</p>
<p>452<br>00:32:21,599 –&gt; 00:32:27,559<br>than one value via this one tuple object from a function.</p>
<p>453<br>00:32:27,559 –&gt; 00:32:32,159<br>And so in this way we can have a function that does a whole bunch of calculations returns</p>
<p>454<br>00:32:32,159 –&gt; 00:32:37,679<br>this one object that might contain all of these different values as the elements to this</p>
<p>455<br>00:32:37,679 –&gt; 00:32:40,319<br>tuple object.</p>
<p>456<br>00:32:40,319 –&gt; 00:32:44,199<br>So let’s have you work on this for a couple minutes.</p>
<p>457<br>00:32:44,199 –&gt; 00:32:46,159<br>Write a function that meets the specification.</p>
<p>458<br>00:32:46,159 –&gt; 00:32:48,359<br>So I’ve got it’s called char counts.</p>
<p>459<br>00:32:48,359 –&gt; 00:32:53,559<br>I’ve got an input that is a string s lower case characters assume it’s just got vowels</p>
<p>460<br>00:32:53,559 –&gt; 00:32:55,519<br>and consonants.</p>
<p>461<br>00:32:55,519 –&gt; 00:32:59,319<br>Return for me a tuple where the first element in the tuple is how many vowels are in</p>
<p>462<br>00:32:59,319 –&gt; 00:33:03,679<br>s and the second element of the tuple is how many consonants are in s.</p>
<p>463<br>00:33:03,679 –&gt; 00:33:08,679<br>So should be pretty straightforward a hint I have here if you don’t remember that will</p>
<p>464<br>00:33:08,679 –&gt; 00:33:14,719<br>make your life easier is try to remember how to check if a character is in a string.</p>
<p>465<br>00:33:14,720 –&gt; 00:33:21,920<br>So using the special in keyword right we saw an example of this probably back when we</p>
<p>466<br>00:33:21,920 –&gt; 00:33:27,039<br>learned about strings.</p>
<p>467<br>00:33:27,039 –&gt; 00:33:36,160<br>So you can try to write your code around line 65 ish and then we can write it together.</p>
<p>468<br>00:33:36,160 –&gt; 00:33:39,799<br>All right so how would you approach this problem?</p>
<p>469<br>00:33:39,799 –&gt; 00:33:46,799<br>So what’s the first step here?</p>
<p>470<br>00:33:46,799 –&gt; 00:33:53,440<br>Yep we can make a string that contains all the vowels.</p>
<p>471<br>00:33:53,440 –&gt; 00:34:03,159<br>Vowels equals a IOU and lower case because nice.</p>
<p>472<br>00:34:03,159 –&gt; 00:34:05,159<br>Next.</p>
<p>473<br>00:34:05,160 –&gt; 00:34:06,160<br>Yep.</p>
<p>474<br>00:34:06,160 –&gt; 00:34:22,159<br>If the car is in that list then we could like have the mirror work contract like plus equals</p>
<p>475<br>00:34:22,159 –&gt; 00:34:30,720<br>plus equals one and else we know it’s not a vowel so we’ll keep a consonants count plus</p>
<p>476<br>00:34:30,720 –&gt; 00:34:32,519<br>equals one.</p>
<p>477<br>00:34:32,519 –&gt; 00:34:41,960<br>So this is the consonant count and this is the vowels count.</p>
<p>478<br>00:34:41,960 –&gt; 00:34:49,320<br>What is char in this case though?</p>
<p>479<br>00:34:49,320 –&gt; 00:34:54,599<br>Yeah exactly we have to loop so four char in s.</p>
<p>480<br>00:34:54,599 –&gt; 00:35:00,360<br>So we need to look at every character inside s and this is where now that we’re dealing</p>
<p>481<br>00:35:00,360 –&gt; 00:35:07,360<br>with things that are just that might be non integers in my four loops we can write little</p>
<p>482<br>00:35:07,360 –&gt; 00:35:15,000<br>notes for ourselves that’s something like char is a then b then c or something like that</p>
<p>483<br>00:35:15,000 –&gt; 00:35:22,680<br>to remind us that char is not sort of the index but it’s an actual thing.</p>
<p>484<br>00:35:22,679 –&gt; 00:35:32,119<br>And then what else we need to do?</p>
<p>485<br>00:35:32,119 –&gt; 00:35:37,519<br>Yeah we can initiate c and v zero we can use the trick where you do c comma v equals zero</p>
<p>486<br>00:35:37,519 –&gt; 00:35:43,719<br>comma zero or we can just do it on separate lines all good.</p>
<p>487<br>00:35:43,719 –&gt; 00:35:49,000<br>And then lastly this does the work for us but the function needs to have something to</p>
<p>488<br>00:35:49,000 –&gt; 00:35:50,679<br>show for it.</p>
<p>489<br>00:35:51,679 –&gt; 00:35:57,679<br>Yeah after the loop we’ll return the tuple c comma v.</p>
<p>490<br>00:35:57,679 –&gt; 00:36:03,559<br>Sorry v comma c probably.</p>
<p>491<br>00:36:03,559 –&gt; 00:36:11,000<br>And if we run it it matches what we expected so one three and zero five and you can imagine</p>
<p>492<br>00:36:11,000 –&gt; 00:36:15,879<br>adding a couple more test cases maybe something with an empty string that should return zero</p>
<p>493<br>00:36:15,880 –&gt; 00:36:22,880<br>zero and maybe something with all vowels which should return some number comma zero.</p>
<p>494<br>00:36:22,880 –&gt; 00:36:32,760<br>Okay so one other thing we can do with with tuples is to create these functions that take</p>
<p>495<br>00:36:32,760 –&gt; 00:36:36,840<br>a variable number of arguments is in as a parameter.</p>
<p>496<br>00:36:36,840 –&gt; 00:36:41,360<br>So remember when we define functions we basically tell Python how many parameter we expect</p>
<p>497<br>00:36:41,360 –&gt; 00:36:43,440<br>it to take right.</p>
<p>498<br>00:36:43,440 –&gt; 00:36:48,840<br>But it’s possible to have some functions for example max or min that can take in two</p>
<p>499<br>00:36:48,840 –&gt; 00:36:55,039<br>parameters here and notice there’s no extra parentheses or we can just add as many numbers</p>
<p>500<br>00:36:55,039 –&gt; 00:37:00,400<br>as we’d like and it will still work to take the max of all of these sets of numbers.</p>
<p>501<br>00:37:00,400 –&gt; 00:37:07,480<br>And again we didn’t make this inner thing a tuple although it works even with the tuple</p>
<p>502<br>00:37:07,480 –&gt; 00:37:09,119<br>as an object.</p>
<p>503<br>00:37:09,119 –&gt; 00:37:14,239<br>But our goal here is to try to write a function that can take in a variable number of arguments</p>
<p>504<br>00:37:14,239 –&gt; 00:37:19,880<br>right either two or three or ten or twenty and it should still work.</p>
<p>505<br>00:37:19,880 –&gt; 00:37:25,519<br>And the way we do that is using a parameter that’s defined using the star notation.</p>
<p>506<br>00:37:25,519 –&gt; 00:37:32,239<br>So as soon as you create a function and its parameter is star and then the name of your input</p>
<p>507<br>00:37:32,239 –&gt; 00:37:37,559<br>Python basically takes that input and assigns it to a tuple behind the scenes.</p>
<p>508<br>00:37:37,559 –&gt; 00:37:39,920<br>So you don’t have to.</p>
<p>509<br>00:37:39,920 –&gt; 00:37:44,400<br>And so in this particular case we’re not using not writing our own max or min or some.</p>
<p>510<br>00:37:44,400 –&gt; 00:37:51,719<br>We’re writing our own mean function and this mean function will take in a variable number</p>
<p>511<br>00:37:51,719 –&gt; 00:37:56,920<br>of arguments right and it’s going to figure out the mean of all of these values.</p>
<p>512<br>00:37:56,920 –&gt; 00:37:59,400<br>The way it does that is pretty simple.</p>
<p>513<br>00:37:59,400 –&gt; 00:38:05,840<br>Now that we know that we can just treat args as a tuple of a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>514<br>00:38:05,840 –&gt; 00:38:09,559<br>So we just loop through all of the elements in args.</p>
<p>515<br>00:38:09,559 –&gt; 00:38:15,120<br>We add up this running total and at the end we return the total divided by how many arguments</p>
<p>516<br>00:38:15,120 –&gt; 00:38:16,120<br>were given.</p>
<p>517<br>00:38:16,120 –&gt; 00:38:19,559<br>So return total divided by the length of the args.</p>
<p>518<br>00:38:19,559 –&gt; 00:38:24,160<br>And then when we make a function call to the function we just wrote mean here args will</p>
<p>519<br>00:38:24,160 –&gt; 00:38:33,400<br>take in sorry args will become a tuple that’s all of the parameters inside there.</p>
<p>520<br>00:38:33,400 –&gt; 00:38:38,440<br>And so here’s that example which means that we can use our function to get the mean</p>
<p>521<br>00:38:38,440 –&gt; 00:38:42,119<br>of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
<p>522<br>00:38:42,119 –&gt; 00:38:46,559<br>But we can use the exact same function to get the mean of 609 for example.</p>
<p>523<br>00:38:46,559 –&gt; 00:38:51,599<br>So first case I have six parameters as my input but in the second case I’ve got only three</p>
<p>524<br>00:38:51,599 –&gt; 00:38:53,559<br>parameters as my input.</p>
<p>525<br>00:38:53,559 –&gt; 00:39:00,840<br>And that little star in my arguments allows me to do this.</p>
<p>526<br>00:39:00,840 –&gt; 00:39:06,519<br>Now I did write a version of this mean for you guys down here where I’m assuming that</p>
<p>527<br>00:39:06,519 –&gt; 00:39:10,559<br>mean doesn’t have the star.</p>
<p>528<br>00:39:10,559 –&gt; 00:39:13,640<br>So assuming that args is a tuple itself.</p>
<p>529<br>00:39:13,640 –&gt; 00:39:19,120<br>And in that case you would have to call the mean function by explicitly passing in only</p>
<p>530<br>00:39:19,120 –&gt; 00:39:21,960<br>one argument that is a tuple.</p>
<p>531<br>00:39:21,960 –&gt; 00:39:26,240<br>So this extra set of parentheses makes my argument the tuple.</p>
<p>532<br>00:39:26,239 –&gt; 00:39:32,599<br>So you take a closer look at that if you’re interested.</p>
<p>533<br>00:39:32,599 –&gt; 00:39:40,000<br>So I want to introduce lists today and a lot of the slides here are basically copy and</p>
<p>534<br>00:39:40,000 –&gt; 00:39:43,000<br>paste from the tuple slides.</p>
<p>535<br>00:39:43,000 –&gt; 00:39:49,579<br>The only difference in these slides that I have regarding lists is the way we define a</p>
<p>536<br>00:39:49,579 –&gt; 00:39:50,579<br>list.</p>
<p>537<br>00:39:50,579 –&gt; 00:39:56,179<br>So in terms of defining a list or defining a tuple we were using parentheses.</p>
<p>538<br>00:39:56,179 –&gt; 00:40:00,059<br>But to define a list we use open closed square brackets.</p>
<p>539<br>00:40:00,059 –&gt; 00:40:06,739<br>But otherwise a lot of the operations are exactly the same as tuples and as strings.</p>
<p>540<br>00:40:06,739 –&gt; 00:40:11,579<br>We’re not going to look at what it means for lists to be mutable this lecture but next</p>
<p>541<br>00:40:11,579 –&gt; 00:40:14,739<br>lecture will be all about mutability.</p>
<p>542<br>00:40:14,739 –&gt; 00:40:19,340<br>But today I just want to give you a sense of what a list is.</p>
<p>543<br>00:40:19,340 –&gt; 00:40:23,620<br>So as I said this is copying and paste from the tuple slide.</p>
<p>544<br>00:40:23,620 –&gt; 00:40:27,620<br>When I create a list I just use open and closed square brackets.</p>
<p>545<br>00:40:27,620 –&gt; 00:40:31,660<br>This creates a list for me with no elements within it.</p>
<p>546<br>00:40:31,660 –&gt; 00:40:35,539<br>Creating a list with one element in it doesn’t need that extra comma because there’s no</p>
<p>547<br>00:40:35,539 –&gt; 00:40:40,340<br>confusion with operation precedence with square brackets.</p>
<p>548<br>00:40:40,340 –&gt; 00:40:42,220<br>So there’s no need for that.</p>
<p>549<br>00:40:42,220 –&gt; 00:40:46,660<br>But otherwise everything else here is exactly the same as with tuples.</p>
<p>550<br>00:40:46,659 –&gt; 00:40:50,980<br>We’re just using square brackets instead of parentheses.</p>
<p>551<br>00:40:50,980 –&gt; 00:40:54,899<br>So remember strings and tuples it’s the same.</p>
<p>552<br>00:40:54,899 –&gt; 00:40:59,039<br>What I do want to mention and talk a little bit about now that we’ve introduced tuples</p>
<p>553<br>00:40:59,039 –&gt; 00:41:05,899<br>and lists is the idea of having our loops iterate over elements of tuples and lists directly.</p>
<p>554<br>00:41:05,899 –&gt; 00:41:10,099<br>And I’m going to basically write these slides in the context of lists but the exact same</p>
<p>555<br>00:41:10,099 –&gt; 00:41:13,659<br>thing is applicable to tuples as well.</p>
<p>556<br>00:41:13,659 –&gt; 00:41:20,179<br>So here is an example of us wanting to find the sum of the elements in a list.</p>
<p>557<br>00:41:20,179 –&gt; 00:41:23,779<br>The code on the left is a little bit hard to parse.</p>
<p>558<br>00:41:23,779 –&gt; 00:41:30,420<br>We’ve got loop variable going through range length n and then I have to keep my running</p>
<p>559<br>00:41:30,420 –&gt; 00:41:36,179<br>total but I have to index into the list at that index here and it’s really hard to tell</p>
<p>560<br>00:41:36,179 –&gt; 00:41:38,940<br>what’s going on at a quick glance.</p>
<p>561<br>00:41:38,940 –&gt; 00:41:44,220<br>And so luckily for us, the way that we were able to iterate over string characters directly,</p>
<p>562<br>00:41:44,220 –&gt; 00:41:48,179<br>we can iterate over tuple and list elements directly.</p>
<p>563<br>00:41:48,179 –&gt; 00:41:54,659<br>So the right hand side here is code that does exactly the same thing as the one on the</p>
<p>564<br>00:41:54,659 –&gt; 00:42:00,980<br>left except that our loop variable i in this particular case will take on the values of</p>
<p>565<br>00:42:00,980 –&gt; 00:42:06,260<br>my list directly.</p>
<p>566<br>00:42:06,260 –&gt; 00:42:11,980<br>And so if we take that code, yes, I guess we call this version more Pythonic because it’s</p>
<p>567<br>00:42:11,980 –&gt; 00:42:13,780<br>a lot easier to read.</p>
<p>568<br>00:42:13,780 –&gt; 00:42:20,940<br>So if we take that code and wrap it around a function to make this piece of code be something</p>
<p>569<br>00:42:20,940 –&gt; 00:42:26,340<br>that we can reuse in a whole bunch of places to grab the sum of all the elements of a list,</p>
<p>570<br>00:42:26,340 –&gt; 00:42:27,420<br>we can do that.</p>
<p>571<br>00:42:27,420 –&gt; 00:42:30,700<br>So here I’ve taken the code that does the work.</p>
<p>572<br>00:42:30,700 –&gt; 00:42:32,700<br>I’ve plopped it inside this function.</p>
<p>573<br>00:42:32,700 –&gt; 00:42:34,100<br>I’ve named list sum.</p>
<p>574<br>00:42:34,099 –&gt; 00:42:40,219<br>I’ve taken a list as a parameter and instead of printing the total, I’m returning the total.</p>
<p>575<br>00:42:40,219 –&gt; 00:42:43,579<br>So very useful function now.</p>
<p>576<br>00:42:43,579 –&gt; 00:42:50,259<br>This loop variable i will take on the values 8, then 3, then 5 if that’s the list I called</p>
<p>577<br>00:42:50,259 –&gt; 00:42:52,460<br>this function with.</p>
<p>578<br>00:42:52,460 –&gt; 00:42:57,900<br>So a lot nicer than iterating over the index and then indexing into the list with the</p>
<p>579<br>00:42:57,900 –&gt; 00:43:01,619<br>square brackets at that index.</p>
<p>580<br>00:43:01,619 –&gt; 00:43:06,539<br>What I do want to mention is something when you’re writing code and this is something</p>
<p>581<br>00:43:06,539 –&gt; 00:43:11,619<br>that I used to do when I first started out, is to write a little comment for yourself</p>
<p>582<br>00:43:11,619 –&gt; 00:43:13,339<br>right underneath the for loop.</p>
<p>583<br>00:43:13,339 –&gt; 00:43:19,819<br>Now I know it’s a little tedious but it does help you keep track of, especially if now</p>
<p>584<br>00:43:19,819 –&gt; 00:43:24,339<br>that we’re iterating over tuples or over lists or over string elements directly or even</p>
<p>585<br>00:43:24,339 –&gt; 00:43:28,980<br>over the indices, it helps you keep track of what this loop variable is value is going</p>
<p>586<br>00:43:28,980 –&gt; 00:43:29,980<br>to be.</p>
<p>587<br>00:43:29,980 –&gt; 00:43:32,019<br>And then you don’t have to keep track of it in your mind.</p>
<p>588<br>00:43:32,019 –&gt; 00:43:35,699<br>It’s on paper and you can use your mind to keep track of other things.</p>
<p>589<br>00:43:35,699 –&gt; 00:43:39,500<br>So if you just write a little comment for yourself there, it helps you debug along the</p>
<p>590<br>00:43:39,500 –&gt; 00:43:42,139<br>way.</p>
<p>591<br>00:43:42,139 –&gt; 00:43:49,420<br>So once we iterate over list elements directly, it makes code that we write really easy</p>
<p>592<br>00:43:49,420 –&gt; 00:43:50,420<br>to read.</p>
<p>593<br>00:43:50,420 –&gt; 00:43:55,460<br>So here the code on the left is going to iterate over the elements directly and get the running</p>
<p>594<br>00:43:55,460 –&gt; 00:43:56,820<br>total.</p>
<p>595<br>00:43:56,820 –&gt; 00:44:00,580<br>So we can make a really small change to the input list.</p>
<p>596<br>00:44:00,580 –&gt; 00:44:09,180<br>Let’s say our input list no longer takes in just numbers but it can take in strings.</p>
<p>597<br>00:44:09,180 –&gt; 00:44:14,940<br>We can make one small change to our loop body.</p>
<p>598<br>00:44:14,940 –&gt; 00:44:20,820<br>Our loop variable still iterates over all the elements in the list L. And then if we write</p>
<p>599<br>00:44:20,820 –&gt; 00:44:26,140<br>the note for ourselves that S is going to be AB then D, F then G.</p>
<p>600<br>00:44:26,139 –&gt; 00:44:32,779<br>If we wanted to write code that grabbed the sum of all of the lengths of the list, the</p>
<p>601<br>00:44:32,779 –&gt; 00:44:38,420<br>total plus equals E on the left hand side becomes total plus equal length of S on the right</p>
<p>602<br>00:44:38,420 –&gt; 00:44:39,819<br>hand side.</p>
<p>603<br>00:44:39,819 –&gt; 00:44:46,019<br>So length of S, one at a time, will take on the value 2 because AB has length 2 and then</p>
<p>604<br>00:44:46,019 –&gt; 00:44:51,859<br>3 because D, F has length 3 and then 1 because G has length 1.</p>
<p>605<br>00:44:51,860 –&gt; 00:44:56,539<br>So the code looks very similar but they have different functionalities depending on what</p>
<p>606<br>00:44:56,539 –&gt; 00:45:03,059<br>we want to do.</p>
<p>607<br>00:45:03,059 –&gt; 00:45:09,099<br>We don’t have time to go through this you try it but definitely try it on your own at home.</p>
<p>608<br>00:45:09,099 –&gt; 00:45:13,620<br>It’s very useful plus a whole bunch of other functions that I’ve put in this Python file</p>
<p>609<br>00:45:13,620 –&gt; 00:45:16,260<br>for you to get a lot of experience with tuples endless.</p>
