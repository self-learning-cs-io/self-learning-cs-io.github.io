                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,000<br>Okay, good afternoon. Can everybody hear me?</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,000<br>Yep.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:09,000 –&gt; 00:00:14,000<br>Thank you. Yes, I will post the election notes at the end of lecture.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:14,000 –&gt; 00:00:17,000<br>In response to the.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:17,000 –&gt; 00:00:18,000<br>Jeff.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:18,000 –&gt; 00:00:21,000<br>Okay, so.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:21,000 –&gt; 00:00:26,000<br>Today, basically, I want to start with a new topic in.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:26,000 –&gt; 00:00:31,000<br>In a two four, there’s sort of a the last topic that we’ll be discussing.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:31,000 –&gt; 00:00:45,000<br>The topic is really decentralized systems.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:45,000 –&gt; 00:00:48,000<br>And these are typically decentralized.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:48,000 –&gt; 00:00:54,000<br>We’re really first to the fact that there’s no single affordee that is in control of the system.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:54,000 –&gt; 00:01:02,000<br>And a lot of the systems that we’ve seen so far, you know, all the machines and server sort of cooperate and are on the.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,000 –&gt; 00:01:07,000<br>Under the control of a single institution or an individual affordee.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:07,000 –&gt; 00:01:12,000<br>And the systems over and a lot of you ask questions about like, how would it work if.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:12,000 –&gt; 00:01:15,000<br>There’s no central point of trust.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,000 –&gt; 00:01:18,000<br>And so.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,000 –&gt; 00:01:24,000<br>And so, you know, on the three systems where the three papers that we’re going to be discussing all sit in this form of decentralized systems.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:24,000 –&gt; 00:01:32,000<br>And, and these centralized systems are harder to build than the sort of single trust systems.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:32,000 –&gt; 00:01:46,000<br>Because, you know, you have to account for business in failure for business business in participants.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:46,000 –&gt; 00:01:49,000<br>And these are participants that you know, sometimes follow the protocol.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:49,000 –&gt; 00:01:51,000<br>Sometimes they don’t follow the protocol.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:51,000 –&gt; 00:01:55,000<br>So, again, the really think about it that they are basically at his areas.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:55,000 –&gt; 00:02:01,000<br>And they may try to abuse or trick other.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:01,000 –&gt; 00:02:07,000<br>Partition is in systems for the wrong goods, but not maybe for others.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:07,000 –&gt; 00:02:09,000<br>And.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:09,000 –&gt; 00:02:16,000<br>And so that makes actually system design with these distributed system designs much more more challenging and much more difficult to reason about.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:16,000 –&gt; 00:02:20,000<br>We feel like in the last, you know, 18, whatever lectures.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:20,000 –&gt; 00:02:25,000<br>Mostly, you know, what we talked about when we designed protocol or thought about raft.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:25,000 –&gt; 00:02:31,000<br>You know, we just assume that actually every participant in the protocol follows the rules.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:31,000 –&gt; 00:02:35,000<br>And in a business in, you know, with business and participants that is not the case anymore.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:35,000 –&gt; 00:02:43,000<br>And so, you know, the participants that can cook up new messages, you know, send messages out of order, trick other participants.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:43,000 –&gt; 00:02:59,000<br>And so the thinking that those kind of protocols is much more difficult because we have to consider like what we have the adversary could do to sort of make our life to break basically the properties of the protocols that we’re shooting for.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:59,000 –&gt; 00:03:05,000<br>And so we make the problem much harder.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:05,000 –&gt; 00:03:17,000<br>And really, you know, we’re what this sort of topic is is so sits on the intersection of distributed systems and security.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:17,000 –&gt; 00:03:22,000<br>And as we’ll see in the, you know, the next, this paper, the next paper.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:22,000 –&gt; 00:03:31,000<br>And so, you know, the photography or security ideas like signing and hashing and are going to be a crucial role to actually make forward progress.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:31,000 –&gt; 00:03:39,000<br>In fact, you know, the paper actually that we’re reading for today is also a paper that we use in 6858.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:39,000 –&gt; 00:03:54,000<br>And in the 658 last spring, we talked about this paper too, although then for mostly from the perspective of security today, I’m going to mostly focus it is on the perspective of distributed systems.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:54,000 –&gt; 00:04:03,000<br>The sundaer itself, a lot of people asked a lot of you ask, you know, is some there being used.</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:03,000 –&gt; 00:04:18,000<br>And as far as I know, there’s actually no systems that actually implement some there directly or they directly based on some other than lap four in 6858 in lap four.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:18,000 –&gt; 00:04:26,000<br>If you do the lap four, the default project, which is lap four in 858, then you actually implement sundaer.</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:26,000 –&gt; 00:04:41,000<br>Now, the reason, and so you might wonder why we’re studying this paper at all, the reason we’re studying it because it actually proposes a number of very powerful technical, powerful ideas.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:41,000 –&gt; 00:04:50,000<br>And so, particularly the same log, even though it is a sort of a strawman design or conceptual design is incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:50,000 –&gt; 00:05:03,000<br>And you see back that same idea here in lots of other decentralized systems, you know, ranging from systems like it to, you know, systems like Bitcoin or any other sort of cryptographic ledger.</p>
<p>45<br>00:05:03,000 –&gt; 00:05:08,000<br>Now, we’re going to be talking about Monday or even next Tuesday.</p>
<p>46<br>00:05:08,000 –&gt; 00:05:17,000<br>I know one system that actually is directly influenced by sundaer, which is a system called key base.</p>
<p>47<br>00:05:17,000 –&gt; 00:05:32,000<br>Keybase users, some there techniques and many more, you know, familiar with key base and actually was reasonably acquired by zoom, which is originally all familiar with.</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:32,000 –&gt; 00:05:51,000<br>Okay, so that’s what I’m for the quick intro to this paper before I’ll dive into the more of the setting any sort of questions before diving a little bit deeper in the table.</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:51,000 –&gt; 00:06:11,000<br>Okay, so let’s talk a little bit about the setting of this paper or the motivation of this paper show the setting in that the hour that the officer said forward is a network file system.</p>
<p>50<br>00:06:11,000 –&gt; 00:06:26,000<br>And you can think of this a little bit into style of a northern paper that we’ve read from to Pani, where the top it also was to implement and consistent, you know, that work file system.</p>
<p>51<br>00:06:26,000 –&gt; 00:06:31,000<br>And so we have a file server.</p>
<p>52<br>00:06:31,000 –&gt; 00:06:40,000<br>We have clients that interact with the file server, you know, somebody might actually create a file, F.</p>
<p>53<br>00:06:40,000 –&gt; 00:06:46,000<br>And maybe in VDAF, another client.</p>
<p>54<br>00:06:46,000 –&gt; 00:06:56,000<br>And you know, the setting that we’re in is that basically the file server as opposed to in the front, F.</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:56,000 –&gt; 00:07:03,000<br>The file server actually can be visited.</p>
<p>56<br>00:07:03,000 –&gt; 00:07:11,000<br>And a visit in really is an extremely powerful front model where you know gives the attacker a hell amount of power.</p>
<p>57<br>00:07:11,000 –&gt; 00:07:20,000<br>So in visit in the server might send different RTCs back, you know, cook up its own RTCs.</p>
<p>58<br>00:07:20,000 –&gt; 00:07:38,000<br>And so take over the machine, you know, a bright administrator and everything is basically, you know, the way to think about it is that the access area gets completely control of the file server.</p>
<p>59<br>00:07:38,000 –&gt; 00:07:53,000<br>And you can ever sort of a wide range of, you know, sort of more common attacks where like in the typical attacks that you might see in the real system, so real attacks one boxing software.</p>
<p>60<br>00:07:53,000 –&gt; 00:08:14,000<br>And there’s a bug in the software, then you know, the access area can exploit that bottom maybe to obtain privileges and, you know, the visiting model completely encompasses that or you know, this system administrator might have a week.</p>
<p>61<br>00:08:14,000 –&gt; 00:08:18,000<br>And then you can see the password.</p>
<p>62<br>00:08:18,000 –&gt; 00:08:29,000<br>The attacker compromises and then they have to control over the system, you know, that’s also covered by visiting physical breaking.</p>
<p>63<br>00:08:29,000 –&gt; 00:08:34,000<br>And then there were Rangers gets access to the physical machine.</p>
<p>64<br>00:08:34,000 –&gt; 00:08:39,000<br>And you know, can therefore control the physical parts of the machine.</p>
<p>65<br>00:08:39,000 –&gt; 00:08:51,000<br>Again, that’s all covered by this, you know, visiting front model or even, you know, maybe the attacker bribes.</p>
<p>66<br>00:08:51,000 –&gt; 00:09:02,000<br>And then the attacker, or collutes with a malicious clients, you know, that is also covered by this model.</p>
<p>67<br>00:09:02,000 –&gt; 00:09:11,000<br>So this is a threat model that is very, very gives a lot of power to the access area and covers a lot of sort of standard attacks.</p>
<p>68<br>00:09:11,000 –&gt; 00:09:16,000<br>And you know, the first thing sort of the observed, you know, the game that.</p>
<p>69<br>00:09:16,000 –&gt; 00:09:29,000<br>Some of their place is that instead of actually, you know, sort of maintaining the whole file system on the file server, the file server is as simple as possible.</p>
<p>70<br>00:09:29,000 –&gt; 00:09:39,000<br>And in fact, you know, the file server is very much like almost like pedal. It’s almost like a block device will a little bit more.</p>
<p>71<br>00:09:39,000 –&gt; 00:09:44,000<br>So the sort of central place where all the blocks are stored.</p>
<p>72<br>00:09:44,000 –&gt; 00:09:55,000<br>And but the clients really able to the file system. So it’s not really, you know, that the client sends a create for a file that actually, you know, sends blocks and reach blocks.</p>
<p>73<br>00:09:55,000 –&gt; 00:09:59,000<br>From, you know, the block server and.</p>
<p>74<br>00:09:59,000 –&gt; 00:10:09,000<br>And basically constructs from the blocks that reach a right, you know, it’s only view of the file system and search, you know, file system operations basically on a straight on the client.</p>
<p>75<br>00:10:09,000 –&gt; 00:10:12,000<br>And so here really, you know, create.</p>
<p>76<br>00:10:12,000 –&gt; 00:10:13,000<br>You know, F.</p>
<p>77<br>00:10:13,000 –&gt; 00:10:16,000<br>Read, et cetera.</p>
<p>78<br>00:10:16,000 –&gt; 00:10:25,000<br>So very, very similar to the front smile, accepting the big difference in front of the is that pedal and all the clients were completely trusted.</p>
<p>79<br>00:10:25,000 –&gt; 00:10:34,000<br>And in this setting, you know, the clients are not trusted. And the file surface that can be also is also not trusted.</p>
<p>80<br>00:10:34,000 –&gt; 00:10:42,000<br>Okay.</p>
<p>81<br>00:10:42,000 –&gt; 00:10:48,000<br>So the paper focus on a particular set of security properties.</p>
<p>82<br>00:10:48,000 –&gt; 00:10:55,000<br>And the focus is really on.</p>
<p>83<br>00:10:55,000 –&gt; 00:11:01,000<br>The focus is on what is called integrity properties.</p>
<p>84<br>00:11:01,000 –&gt; 00:11:07,000<br>And in contrast to confidentiality, confidentiality is about protecting data for so that nobody else can read it.</p>
<p>85<br>00:11:07,000 –&gt; 00:11:12,000<br>Integrities is just ensuring that the system structure is correct.</p>
<p>86<br>00:11:12,000 –&gt; 00:11:22,000<br>And the modifications illegal modifications to the data are being detected. And whether the data is public or not public, you know, sort of sites the point here.</p>
<p>87<br>00:11:22,000 –&gt; 00:11:34,000<br>And to make it a little bit more concrete, you know, what they’re sort of the thing that they have in their minds is we have a set of, you know, we have developers.</p>
<p>88<br>00:11:34,000 –&gt; 00:11:49,000<br>And that one, you know, that to you, they may share, you know, some machine that contains the source code repository of some, you know, source from projects, the developers, you know, collaborating on that project.</p>
<p>89<br>00:11:49,000 –&gt; 00:12:03,000<br>And, and sort of think about this as the example that the paper mentions is in the paper, maybe this is the development machines and server for devian Linux.</p>
<p>90<br>00:12:03,000 –&gt; 00:12:12,000<br>And the one of again, defend against is trap or a trad or.</p>
<p>91<br>00:12:12,000 –&gt; 00:12:28,000<br>So the, you know, an attacker, you know, takes over control breaks into the machine that contains the source repo, modifies the software in notice.</p>
<p>92<br>00:12:28,000 –&gt; 00:12:35,000<br>And then it’s all going out of that software gets deployed, you know, for example, devian Linux gets deployed a lot of lots of machines.</p>
<p>93<br>00:12:35,000 –&gt; 00:12:44,000<br>And now the attacker has control over those machines because it can exploit the trap to one.</p>
<p>94<br>00:12:44,000 –&gt; 00:12:53,000<br>The paper talks about this attack, this particularly instance in of devian Linux in 2003.</p>
<p>95<br>00:12:53,000 –&gt; 00:12:59,000<br>Where, you know, the attacker was able to compromise, you know, the development server or cluster.</p>
<p>96<br>00:12:59,000 –&gt; 00:13:03,000<br>And recovering from these kinds of attacks is very painful.</p>
<p>97<br>00:13:03,000 –&gt; 00:13:18,000<br>In fact, in 2003, you know, they report that the devian Linux and the search for rose development for a couple days, while they were trying to sort out which, you know, part of their short repo, we still, you know, correct, in which part were actually modified by a attacker.</p>
<p>98<br>00:13:18,000 –&gt; 00:13:21,000<br>And these attacks happen sort of periodically.</p>
<p>99<br>00:13:21,000 –&gt; 00:13:29,000<br>I think last year, you know, you’re going to have a similar type of problem in 2018 or 2019, I remember exactly.</p>
<p>100<br>00:13:29,000 –&gt; 00:13:37,000<br>And there was a similar case where the one of the core development servers was broken into.</p>
<p>101<br>00:13:37,000 –&gt; 00:13:47,000<br>And you know, they have to sort of short out what were we, what were the seed which suffered, which files got affected affected by that breaking.</p>
<p>102<br>00:13:47,000 –&gt; 00:13:52,000<br>Okay, so that’s sort of the setting of the paper.</p>
<p>103<br>00:13:52,000 –&gt; 00:14:04,000<br>And I’m going to make a little bit more concrete and a little bit of a point example to help us go through the techniques that this paper actually uses.</p>
<p>104<br>00:14:04,000 –&gt; 00:14:16,000<br>So the example that I’m going to use is part of the inspired by 6858 is, you know, let’s say, you know, we have a file system.</p>
<p>105<br>00:14:16,000 –&gt; 00:14:19,000<br>You’re doing the.</p>
<p>106<br>00:14:19,000 –&gt; 00:14:27,000<br>And the file system contains, you know, the source code for this application that we use in 888 called zoo bar.</p>
<p>107<br>00:14:27,000 –&gt; 00:14:39,000<br>And in zoo bar, he’s sort of a virtual bank type application where users of the system register users of the systems can transfer or zoo bars to each other.</p>
<p>108<br>00:14:39,000 –&gt; 00:14:45,000<br>And so it has a file called off dot p y, you know, that does an off education.</p>
<p>109<br>00:14:45,000 –&gt; 00:14:51,000<br>And if that’s a file that basically, you know, it’s sort of the bank bank, you know, bank, p y.</p>
<p>110<br>00:14:51,000 –&gt; 00:15:00,000<br>And so, you know, let’s consider the case where, you know, we have a set of develop us, a, b and c.</p>
<p>111<br>00:15:00,000 –&gt; 00:15:08,000<br>And you know, they decide that they want to sort of increase the usability of zoo bar and action to deploy it for real.</p>
<p>112<br>00:15:08,000 –&gt; 00:15:19,000<br>And to make it real, basically, you know, they decide to divide the workers follows a is going to modify off the UI.</p>
<p>113<br>00:15:19,000 –&gt; 00:15:31,000<br>To support MIT certificates for MIT certs, the curbors ticket, or certificates.</p>
<p>114<br>00:15:31,000 –&gt; 00:15:46,000<br>And with the idea that they know what they’re going to do is, you know, you’re going to off the ice going to be modified so that the lane, the budget, MIT community members actually can log into the file server,</p>
<p>115<br>00:15:46,000 –&gt; 00:15:54,000<br>or into zoo bar, and sort of we actually know, you know, who it actually really is that is associated with that particular MIT certificate.</p>
<p>116<br>00:15:54,000 –&gt; 00:16:04,000<br>And then they make it a little bit more useful, you know, b is going to actually modify the bank, p y, directly link it to cash tag.</p>
<p>117<br>00:16:04,000 –&gt; 00:16:25,000<br>And so, you know, basically, we can actually use the zoo bars from the system, of course, you can have a doodab, but like we can use the zoo bar system to actually transfer money, you know, real money instead of zoo bars between users that are registered with this service.</p>
<p>118<br>00:16:25,000 –&gt; 00:16:36,000<br>Now, this ends, of course, like a crazy idea, and you know, really do it, but you know, it’s not completely ridiculous, you know, because the off P.O.I really checks who it actually is based on the MIT certificate.</p>
<p>119<br>00:16:36,000 –&gt; 00:16:43,000<br>And so maybe it’s not in regional that, you know, we could connect, you know, back to P.O.I to actually tech catch.</p>
<p>120<br>00:16:43,000 –&gt; 00:16:52,000<br>And then basically see in our scenarios is going to be a person that’s actually going to deploy the software.</p>
<p>121<br>00:16:53,000 –&gt; 00:17:01,000<br>And find machine takes itself or installs it there and runs it and opens it up to the MIT community.</p>
<p>122<br>00:17:01,000 –&gt; 00:17:13,000<br>Now, in the case, now let’s consider what, you know, what could happen, what could go wrong, if actually the file server was compromised. And so it was visited.</p>
<p>123<br>00:17:14,000 –&gt; 00:17:23,000<br>Well, the obvious, you know, problem is a couple of obvious problems, you know, bad outcomes possible.</p>
<p>124<br>00:17:23,000 –&gt; 00:17:26,000<br>So let’s consider them.</p>
<p>125<br>00:17:26,000 –&gt; 00:17:38,000<br>Bad outcome one, which is the one we’ve always been talking about in the previous examples is going to basically the adversary gives arbitrary code to see.</p>
<p>126<br>00:17:39,000 –&gt; 00:17:41,000<br>In an adversary.</p>
<p>127<br>00:17:46,000 –&gt; 00:17:51,000<br>Provides own code to see.</p>
<p>128<br>00:17:54,000 –&gt; 00:18:05,000<br>That’s sort of the, or maybe the answers are slightly subtle about it or clever about it, you know, whatever makes it a little bit hard to spot that actually modified off P.O.I.</p>
<p>129<br>00:18:06,000 –&gt; 00:18:18,000<br>For example, the DLT MIT certificates, but there’s basically, you know, there’s really no way for C to check that actually it got the software that A and B produced and without any modifications from the adversary.</p>
<p>130<br>00:18:18,000 –&gt; 00:18:26,000<br>So that’s sort of the obvious a problem with me talking a lot about it. Then there’s a second sort of bad outcome, which will maybe a little more subtle.</p>
<p>131<br>00:18:27,000 –&gt; 00:18:32,000<br>Which is that the adversary.</p>
<p>132<br>00:18:32,000 –&gt; 00:18:38,000<br>Provides the changes, you know, to beg with on P.O.I.</p>
<p>133<br>00:18:38,000 –&gt; 00:18:43,000<br>Without the changes.</p>
<p>134<br>00:18:43,000 –&gt; 00:18:48,000<br>To off to.</p>
<p>135<br>00:18:49,000 –&gt; 00:19:00,000<br>And so at this point, you know, this is pretty problematic, right? Because you know, beg people I linked to tech cash now, but we actually don’t have appropriate application of the users anymore.</p>
<p>136<br>00:19:00,000 –&gt; 00:19:06,000<br>In fact, anybody that actually creates a super account can now actually interact with the tech cash.</p>
<p>137<br>00:19:06,000 –&gt; 00:19:11,000<br>And so clearly very, very undesirable.</p>
<p>138<br>00:19:12,000 –&gt; 00:19:35,000<br>And so it’s really, you know, of course, the tax, you know, the paper.</p>
<p>139<br>00:19:36,000 –&gt; 00:19:45,000<br>But there are a lot of some of the subtle issues actually are brought out by the sort of second case that we’ll be talking about.</p>
<p>140<br>00:19:45,000 –&gt; 00:19:49,000<br>Any questions so far?</p>
<p>141<br>00:19:49,000 –&gt; 00:19:54,000<br>About the setting and by the motivation.</p>
<p>142<br>00:19:54,000 –&gt; 00:19:58,000<br>Before I’m going to try to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>143<br>00:19:59,000 –&gt; 00:20:06,000<br>And the second case is that the user that the author, the authentication does not authenticate.</p>
<p>144<br>00:20:06,000 –&gt; 00:20:13,000<br>Yeah, there’s a dozen use MIT certificates anymore. And so we don’t really know actually who wants in.</p>
<p>145<br>00:20:13,000 –&gt; 00:20:15,000<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>146<br>00:20:15,000 –&gt; 00:20:18,000<br>What about the case where.</p>
<p>147<br>00:20:18,000 –&gt; 00:20:24,000<br>A or like B won’t see is like the fork.</p>
<p>148<br>00:20:24,000 –&gt; 00:20:36,000<br>Let’s assume for a second that a and B actually, you know, I have talked to each other and divided up the work that I know that they’re supposed to be doing this together.</p>
<p>149<br>00:20:37,000 –&gt; 00:20:39,000<br>And so we’re in the team.</p>
<p>150<br>00:20:39,000 –&gt; 00:20:51,000<br>They’re in close collaboration and contact, you know, and they’ve divided up the work. And so they know we’re, you know, B tells A when he’s done B tells A when he’s done and then they tell see where I’ll go ahead. We’re all done.</p>
<p>151<br>00:20:51,000 –&gt; 00:20:54,000<br>Okay.</p>
<p>152<br>00:20:54,000 –&gt; 00:20:56,000<br>Okay, so.</p>
<p>153<br>00:20:56,000 –&gt; 00:21:03,000<br>Let’s start with considering a simple design does it’s too simple meaning another work.</p>
<p>154<br>00:21:03,000 –&gt; 00:21:11,000<br>And you know, starting points for more sophisticated design that you know, hopefully might work.</p>
<p>155<br>00:21:11,000 –&gt; 00:21:17,000<br>And so the simple plan is that a and B or any.</p>
<p>156<br>00:21:17,000 –&gt; 00:21:30,000<br>All the files are going to be signed with the person who modified it. So when like a modifies you off the PY.</p>
<p>157<br>00:21:30,000 –&gt; 00:21:34,000<br>And so the actually produces a signature.</p>
<p>158<br>00:21:34,000 –&gt; 00:21:39,000<br>And that signed with the public key.</p>
<p>159<br>00:21:39,000 –&gt; 00:21:45,000<br>What signature signed that the public key of a.</p>
<p>160<br>00:21:45,000 –&gt; 00:21:52,000<br>And you know that signature covers the data of the file.</p>
<p>161<br>00:21:52,000 –&gt; 00:22:06,000<br>So when see, you know downloads, you know, the off not PY, you know, checks the signature.</p>
<p>162<br>00:22:06,000 –&gt; 00:22:10,000<br>And if the signature checks out, you know, then I see those that actually this file was produced.</p>
<p>163<br>00:22:10,000 –&gt; 00:22:13,000<br>There’s my files induced produced by a.</p>
<p>164<br>00:22:13,000 –&gt; 00:22:17,000<br>And you know, I don’t believe that things are good.</p>
<p>165<br>00:22:17,000 –&gt; 00:22:22,000<br>And that’s the basic plan. And you know, we’ll talk a little bit about it to get where the keys are coming from.</p>
<p>166<br>00:22:22,000 –&gt; 00:22:28,000<br>Although the issue is sort of public key distribution. It really an eight five eight topics. I’m not going to talk too much about it.</p>
<p>167<br>00:22:28,000 –&gt; 00:22:33,000<br>But just assume for now that every user has a key.</p>
<p>168<br>00:22:33,000 –&gt; 00:22:36,000<br>A private key pair.</p>
<p>169<br>00:22:36,000 –&gt; 00:22:40,000<br>And the private keys are key secrets and the public keys are public.</p>
<p>170<br>00:22:40,000 –&gt; 00:22:45,000<br>And every user knows who’s public key belongs to who.</p>
<p>171<br>00:22:45,000 –&gt; 00:22:49,000<br>So now let’s consider some.</p>
<p>172<br>00:22:49,000 –&gt; 00:22:51,000<br>Attacks.</p>
<p>173<br>00:22:51,000 –&gt; 00:22:56,000<br>And see which one sort of, you know, fail, which ones, you know, work.</p>
<p>174<br>00:22:56,000 –&gt; 00:23:01,000<br>So of course, the obviously tech was number one that we talked about on the previous slide.</p>
<p>175<br>00:23:01,000 –&gt; 00:23:03,000<br>Misses modifies.</p>
<p>176<br>00:23:03,000 –&gt; 00:23:06,000<br>Files.</p>
<p>177<br>00:23:06,000 –&gt; 00:23:09,000<br>And that is not a little bit.</p>
<p>178<br>00:23:09,000 –&gt; 00:23:11,000<br>That’s not directly.</p>
<p>179<br>00:23:11,000 –&gt; 00:23:14,000<br>As modifies out of the guy.</p>
<p>180<br>00:23:14,000 –&gt; 00:23:17,000<br>That’s going to not really going to be possible anymore.</p>
<p>181<br>00:23:17,000 –&gt; 00:23:23,000<br>Because when C downloads the file and the signature and checks it.</p>
<p>182<br>00:23:23,000 –&gt; 00:23:32,000<br>And it will see that the signature different check because the data that actually was signed is different than the data that actually the server produced.</p>
<p>183<br>00:23:32,000 –&gt; 00:23:40,000<br>And so it’s not really possible for the server really to modify off the PY without actually being attacked or be without being detected.</p>
<p>184<br>00:23:40,000 –&gt; 00:23:45,000<br>So, you know, this is where we’re sort of in good shape here on this attack.</p>
<p>185<br>00:23:45,000 –&gt; 00:23:48,000<br>And that’s sort of the core attack, right?</p>
<p>186<br>00:23:48,000 –&gt; 00:23:51,000<br>But there’s a lot of other things that.</p>
<p>187<br>00:23:51,000 –&gt; 00:23:52,000<br>It still could do.</p>
<p>188<br>00:23:52,000 –&gt; 00:23:55,000<br>So let’s consider some of the other things.</p>
<p>189<br>00:23:55,000 –&gt; 00:24:01,000<br>S, you know, could actually in the way I described that we send another file.</p>
<p>190<br>00:24:01,000 –&gt; 00:24:07,000<br>It pretends to be off that PY.</p>
<p>191<br>00:24:07,000 –&gt; 00:24:12,000<br>Because the signature doesn’t really say which actually file the data belongs to.</p>
<p>192<br>00:24:12,000 –&gt; 00:24:17,000<br>And so as could just, you know, produce some other files.</p>
<p>193<br>00:24:17,000 –&gt; 00:24:20,000<br>So you don’t know, you know, see this is actually off the PY.</p>
<p>194<br>00:24:20,000 –&gt; 00:24:26,000<br>You could believe me in years that the science, the signature that was of course produced the S.</p>
<p>195<br>00:24:26,000 –&gt; 00:24:28,000<br>So, of course, this could be fixed.</p>
<p>196<br>00:24:28,000 –&gt; 00:24:35,000<br>You know, maybe the signature should not only include the data, but also probably should include the file name.</p>
<p>197<br>00:24:35,000 –&gt; 00:24:42,000<br>So, you know, maybe not too, too bad in something that could be addressed.</p>
<p>198<br>00:24:42,000 –&gt; 00:24:47,000<br>A first, you know, another, you know, another possibility is to for.</p>
<p>199<br>00:24:47,000 –&gt; 00:24:52,000<br>S to basically send the contents of old files.</p>
<p>200<br>00:24:52,000 –&gt; 00:24:55,000<br>Old content.</p>
<p>201<br>00:24:55,000 –&gt; 00:25:03,000<br>And maybe some new.</p>
<p>202<br>00:25:03,000 –&gt; 00:25:07,000<br>And that’s a little bit more difficult now for us to.</p>
<p>203<br>00:25:07,000 –&gt; 00:25:10,000<br>To handle correct in this two simple plan.</p>
<p>204<br>00:25:10,000 –&gt; 00:25:17,000<br>Because the, there’s no way, you know, basically the files are individually authenticated, but not together.</p>
<p>205<br>00:25:17,000 –&gt; 00:25:18,000<br>It’s not that.</p>
<p>206<br>00:25:18,000 –&gt; 00:25:21,000<br>See gets sort of a consistent picture of the file system.</p>
<p>207<br>00:25:21,000 –&gt; 00:25:24,000<br>It just gets like sign files.</p>
<p>208<br>00:25:24,000 –&gt; 00:25:31,000<br>And how does sign files relate to each other in terms of their histories is completely not covered in this two simple design.</p>
<p>209<br>00:25:31,000 –&gt; 00:25:37,000<br>This is exactly, of course, you know, the issue that there’s more subtle tech that now could just completely work out.</p>
<p>210<br>00:25:37,000 –&gt; 00:25:41,000<br>Because, you know, S could send the.</p>
<p>211<br>00:25:41,000 –&gt; 00:25:45,000<br>As could send the old version of off the PY.</p>
<p>212<br>00:25:45,000 –&gt; 00:25:47,000<br>And we’ll completely check out.</p>
<p>213<br>00:25:47,000 –&gt; 00:25:51,000<br>And then send the new version of the.</p>
<p>214<br>00:25:51,000 –&gt; 00:25:56,000<br>Of the bank that PY, which actually talks to the link to tech cash.</p>
<p>215<br>00:25:56,000 –&gt; 00:26:06,000<br>Now exactly back in the worst case, we’re, you know, we have an old version of off the PY or not the changes to off the PY, not the certificate changes to the off the PY.</p>
<p>216<br>00:26:06,000 –&gt; 00:26:10,000<br>And the new version that actually linked to tech cash.</p>
<p>217<br>00:26:10,000 –&gt; 00:26:12,000<br>And so this is not so good.</p>
<p>218<br>00:26:12,000 –&gt; 00:26:18,000<br>So, and the simple point that we have here just doesn’t deal with this.</p>
<p>219<br>00:26:18,000 –&gt; 00:26:32,000<br>Similar sort of another sort of version of this that we’re, you know, of course, you know, asking also just claim that the file doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>220<br>00:26:32,000 –&gt; 00:26:43,000<br>And see, doesn’t really have any way of checking whether that actually is true or not, because again, they don’t have a global picture where it is a consistent view of the files.</p>
<p>221<br>00:26:43,000 –&gt; 00:26:53,000<br>And so, you can see that the simple design, or maybe good starting point, but we need something more.</p>
<p>222<br>00:26:53,000 –&gt; 00:27:04,000<br>More complete, particularly we need something that really ties you know, all the file systems, all the files together that types of directors together to count it up the directors together.</p>
<p>223<br>00:27:04,000 –&gt; 00:27:10,000<br>And we have to be able to decide in some way again, what is the leaders version of the file system.</p>
<p>224<br>00:27:10,000 –&gt; 00:27:19,000<br>And so that you can’t be tricked into in this sort of problem, out of case, where one file is installed and the other other file is not installed.</p>
<p>225<br>00:27:19,000 –&gt; 00:27:27,000<br>And so that’s really what the some of the paper tries to address.</p>
<p>226<br>00:27:27,000 –&gt; 00:27:36,000<br>And the big idea in the paper, and it just turns out to be just a big idea in general.</p>
<p>227<br>00:27:36,000 –&gt; 00:27:44,000<br>And it’s a conceptual idea. You can know the paper action doesn’t really implement this big idea directly, it implements it in a more indirect way.</p>
<p>228<br>00:27:44,000 –&gt; 00:27:48,000<br>It is an incredibly powerful idea.</p>
<p>229<br>00:27:48,000 –&gt; 00:28:02,000<br>And the big idea is to have a signed law of operations.</p>
<p>230<br>00:28:02,000 –&gt; 00:28:17,000<br>And of course, you know, you’re well familiar with blocks of operations. And you know, you can, and this is basically a sort of beefed up version of it where there are signatures on the walk entries that both consider cover the entry as well as kind of proceeding entries.</p>
<p>231<br>00:28:17,000 –&gt; 00:28:32,000<br>And this turns out to be, as you’ve seen in all the previous decisions systems and failure recovery protocols, we talked about the log is actually a very powerful idea to think about like the correctness of the system.</p>
<p>232<br>00:28:32,000 –&gt; 00:28:39,000<br>And in the same way that ideas are carried forward here in this business in context.</p>
<p>233<br>00:28:39,000 –&gt; 00:28:46,000<br>And so what you know, let me draw, you know, in a simple log.</p>
<p>234<br>00:28:46,000 –&gt; 00:28:56,000<br>And we’re going to capture some of the in this in the paper. So a lot, whatever has some entries and let’s say, you know, we’re covering covering the things that we are talking about. So there’s a modification.</p>
<p>235<br>00:28:56,000 –&gt; 00:29:08,000<br>You know, mod off not p y, you know, by a signed by a, you know, there’s a mod.</p>
<p>236<br>00:29:08,000 –&gt; 00:29:21,000<br>And if you go to all, you know, the amount of the bank, the p y signed by the.</p>
<p>237<br>00:29:21,000 –&gt; 00:29:33,000<br>And as we’ll talk about in a second, it turns out that not only are the modifications in the log, but also the fetch, you know, the read operations.</p>
<p>238<br>00:29:33,000 –&gt; 00:29:57,000<br>And then we’ll talk about the fetch operations of the fetch operations a little bit.</p>
<p>239<br>00:29:57,000 –&gt; 00:30:05,000<br>So the first one I want to talk about the preceding operations for the modifications.</p>
<p>240<br>00:30:05,000 –&gt; 00:30:24,000<br>So first of all, the one is important to realize is the distinct here that is in the record that only covers the current record, but it also covers all the records before.</p>
<p>241<br>00:30:24,000 –&gt; 00:30:30,000<br>So you’ve stopped for a second here because I’m not 100% sure if actually can everybody still hear me.</p>
<p>242<br>00:30:30,000 –&gt; 00:30:33,000<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>243<br>00:30:33,000 –&gt; 00:30:39,000<br>Okay, I got my iPad logged out of the zoom session, almost logged in twice.</p>
<p>244<br>00:30:39,000 –&gt; 00:30:47,000<br>My iPad logged out. So I just want to make sure that I’m still talking to you and you can hear me.</p>
<p>245<br>00:30:47,000 –&gt; 00:31:17,000<br>And then I just want to make sure that I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m</p>
<p>246<br>00:31:17,000 –&gt; 00:31:22,259<br>100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 50% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure If I’m not 100%. Sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m on farm equity then I’m</p>
<p>247<br>00:31:22,259 –&gt; 00:31:30,559<br>100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100% sure if I’m not 100%. I think we lost, friends.</p>
<p>248<br>00:31:47,000 –&gt; 00:32:05,680<br>Can people hear me now?</p>
<p>249<br>00:32:05,680 –&gt; 00:32:09,880<br>Does anybody hear me?</p>
<p>250<br>00:32:09,880 –&gt; 00:32:10,880<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>251<br>00:32:10,880 –&gt; 00:32:11,880<br>Yes.</p>
<p>252<br>00:32:11,880 –&gt; 00:32:12,880<br>Oh, okay, good, good.</p>
<p>253<br>00:32:12,880 –&gt; 00:32:13,880<br>Okay.</p>
<p>254<br>00:32:13,880 –&gt; 00:32:20,880<br>I don’t know if anything weird happened in your end, but in my end, I got logged out of</p>
<p>255<br>00:32:20,880 –&gt; 00:32:24,600<br>Zoom and logged back in.</p>
<p>256<br>00:32:24,600 –&gt; 00:32:28,720<br>Maybe there’s a business insurer at work.</p>
<p>257<br>00:32:28,720 –&gt; 00:32:31,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>258<br>00:32:31,240 –&gt; 00:32:35,080<br>Let me hold on one second and get myself in.</p>
<p>259<br>00:32:43,960 –&gt; 00:33:04,560<br>Let me just let me get your off.</p>
<p>260<br>00:33:04,560 –&gt; 00:33:09,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>261<br>00:33:09,240 –&gt; 00:33:11,680<br>Let me know if I’m good.</p>
<p>262<br>00:33:11,680 –&gt; 00:33:12,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>263<br>00:33:12,680 –&gt; 00:33:13,680<br>Good.</p>
<p>264<br>00:33:13,680 –&gt; 00:33:14,680<br>Good.</p>
<p>265<br>00:33:14,680 –&gt; 00:33:16,680<br>I was pre-searing yet, but yeah.</p>
<p>266<br>00:33:16,680 –&gt; 00:33:17,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>267<br>00:33:17,680 –&gt; 00:33:18,680<br>I’m hoping this works better.</p>
<p>268<br>00:33:18,680 –&gt; 00:33:19,680<br>Okay.</p>
<p>269<br>00:33:19,680 –&gt; 00:33:27,680<br>So I was at this important point where the signal you’re just not covered the log entry itself,</p>
<p>270<br>00:33:27,680 –&gt; 00:33:32,680<br>but it also covers all the preceding log entries.</p>
<p>271<br>00:33:32,680 –&gt; 00:33:37,680<br>And so when, you know, a as this modification to off qy to the log,</p>
<p>272<br>00:33:37,680 –&gt; 00:33:41,680<br>it signs the log records itself, plus the preceding log.</p>
<p>273<br>00:33:41,680 –&gt; 00:33:55,680<br>And you can think about this that the preceding log is maybe represented by the content of the preceding log is a cryptographic hash and in the record basically of the modification to off the people</p>
<p>274<br>00:33:55,680 –&gt; 00:34:04,680<br>that you off the people either the cryptographic hash of the preceding part of the log is included and covered by the signature.</p>
<p>275<br>00:34:04,680 –&gt; 00:34:07,680<br>Just to be clear, we still can’t see the screen.</p>
<p>276<br>00:34:07,680 –&gt; 00:34:08,680<br>Can’t see the screen.</p>
<p>277<br>00:34:08,680 –&gt; 00:34:18,680<br>Oh, the screen hasn’t changed yet, but let me see if I can do something about that.</p>
<p>278<br>00:34:18,679 –&gt; 00:34:20,679<br>I guess.</p>
<p>279<br>00:34:20,679 –&gt; 00:34:33,679<br>I assume still things that there’s actually sharing the screen that doesn’t look like an excellent.</p>
<p>280<br>00:34:33,679 –&gt; 00:34:37,679<br>How about this?</p>
<p>281<br>00:34:37,679 –&gt; 00:34:38,679<br>Yep.</p>
<p>282<br>00:34:38,679 –&gt; 00:34:39,679<br>I can see now.</p>
<p>283<br>00:34:39,679 –&gt; 00:34:40,679<br>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>284<br>00:34:40,679 –&gt; 00:34:42,679<br>Okay. So I didn’t change anything yet.</p>
<p>285<br>00:34:42,679 –&gt; 00:34:50,679<br>I think I was going to draw the next era, which basically when B signs, you know, it’s actually covered all the preceding entries to.</p>
<p>286<br>00:34:50,679 –&gt; 00:34:56,679<br>And this is sort of good, correct? Because when.</p>
<p>287<br>00:34:56,679 –&gt; 00:35:04,679<br>The client, you know, C actually receives, you know, or gets actually sees the log entry for B, then.</p>
<p>288<br>00:35:04,679 –&gt; 00:35:15,679<br>So it’s impossible for the server to drop the log entry of a because you know that will be detected when C actually detected signature on the log entry of B.</p>
<p>289<br>00:35:15,679 –&gt; 00:35:25,679<br>So we already made sort of a big step forward in the sense that it’s much harder for the server now to selectively draw block entries.</p>
<p>290<br>00:35:25,679 –&gt; 00:35:36,679<br>So that’s it. So that we’re pretty good pretty good shit. You know, the server cannot drop any.</p>
<p>291<br>00:35:36,679 –&gt; 00:35:44,679<br>And keep these modifications.</p>
<p>292<br>00:35:44,679 –&gt; 00:35:47,679<br>So that’s actually a big, big, big step forward.</p>
<p>293<br>00:35:47,679 –&gt; 00:35:53,679<br>And this is look a little bit more in detail. How does it actually is going to play out. So we’re declined C.</p>
<p>294<br>00:35:53,679 –&gt; 00:36:01,679<br>And you know, we’re fetching the log to basically roll out, you know, the distribution of the software to install it on a particular machine.</p>
<p>295<br>00:36:01,679 –&gt; 00:36:14,679<br>The first thing the client does, you know, it actually checks all the signatures.</p>
<p>296<br>00:36:14,679 –&gt; 00:36:21,679<br>So always the question of course is like when, you know, you want to check the signal of the log entry, you know, which public key do you use.</p>
<p>297<br>00:36:21,679 –&gt; 00:36:33,679<br>And because you want to make sure that you’re not being tricked in accepting your signature open modification by a, but turns out that actually was not the person actually who signed it.</p>
<p>298<br>00:36:33,679 –&gt; 00:36:43,679<br>And it turns out that basically, in to figure out like with key to use to actually verify the signature, the key uses the owner of the file.</p>
<p>299<br>00:36:43,679 –&gt; 00:36:48,679<br>So the public key needs to correspond to the owner of the files.</p>
<p>300<br>00:36:48,679 –&gt; 00:36:53,679<br>And ignoring groups for now.</p>
<p>301<br>00:36:53,679 –&gt; 00:36:57,679<br>You know, basically only the owner of the file is allowed to modify file.</p>
<p>302<br>00:36:57,679 –&gt; 00:37:04,679<br>So for this simple, for this, for this, like simplified, you know, we can think about it that they’re going to off the PIs owned by a.</p>
<p>303<br>00:37:04,679 –&gt; 00:37:08,679<br>And the idea of the files basically the public key of a.</p>
<p>304<br>00:37:08,679 –&gt; 00:37:17,679<br>And so we know which public key to use and, and get verified the signature with it.</p>
<p>305<br>00:37:17,679 –&gt; 00:37:23,679<br>And so if somebody else, you know, makes a modification that pretends to be a, that actually is not going to check out.</p>
<p>306<br>00:37:23,679 –&gt; 00:37:28,679<br>So it’s really only a that connects and make the modifications and similar for people.</p>
<p>307<br>00:37:28,679 –&gt; 00:37:40,679<br>So that’s part of the, you know, one thing that’s actually clever about some of them, which I’m not really going to be talking about in some sense, the file system is actually doubling both as a file system as an as a public key.</p>
<p>308<br>00:37:40,679 –&gt; 00:37:46,679<br>Public key infrastructure distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p>309<br>00:37:46,679 –&gt; 00:37:53,679<br>And so it is actually possible to use some of the basically the right we determine like in which user has which public key.</p>
<p>310<br>00:37:53,679 –&gt; 00:38:01,679<br>But I’m not really going to talk about this. I really want to focus on the consistency aspects and the more distributed systems aspects.</p>
<p>311<br>00:38:01,679 –&gt; 00:38:06,679<br>The second thing that the client does is check.</p>
<p>312<br>00:38:06,679 –&gt; 00:38:13,679<br>It’s own last entry.</p>
<p>313<br>00:38:13,679 –&gt; 00:38:18,679<br>And this is to protect, you know, the client from actually being rolled back by the server in time.</p>
<p>314<br>00:38:18,679 –&gt; 00:38:22,679<br>The server can’t actually buy the client check always is last entry.</p>
<p>315<br>00:38:22,679 –&gt; 00:38:32,679<br>If it’s last entry is in the log still, then you know, the only way forward for the attacker is to actually get a role the file system for a can roll backwards.</p>
<p>316<br>00:38:32,679 –&gt; 00:38:39,679<br>So see will check whether or then you have its previous operations are in it and you know confirm that there is still in it.</p>
<p>317<br>00:38:39,679 –&gt; 00:38:42,679<br>Actually, it’s last entry still in it.</p>
<p>318<br>00:38:42,679 –&gt; 00:38:44,679<br>So question here.</p>
<p>319<br>00:38:44,679 –&gt; 00:38:47,679<br>This only.</p>
<p>320<br>00:38:47,679 –&gt; 00:38:57,679<br>I think this attack from the server to roll back would only work if no other client wrote to the log.</p>
<p>321<br>00:38:57,679 –&gt; 00:39:05,679<br>But like after this clients last entry, right, because otherwise checking signatures would figure that out.</p>
<p>322<br>00:39:05,679 –&gt; 00:39:11,679<br>Yeah, although the, you know, let’s talk about it in a second. Maybe you can always play a fork attack, right?</p>
<p>323<br>00:39:11,679 –&gt; 00:39:16,679<br>So you can always split, you know, the view of the file system, the most views.</p>
<p>324<br>00:39:16,679 –&gt; 00:39:21,679<br>But you can at least not roll back to client once the client saw a particular file system.</p>
<p>325<br>00:39:21,679 –&gt; 00:39:24,679<br>You can go back for some time.</p>
<p>326<br>00:39:24,679 –&gt; 00:39:32,679<br>Now the client can, the server can present different file systems in future, but you can’t roll back.</p>
<p>327<br>00:39:32,679 –&gt; 00:39:35,679<br>Third part.</p>
<p>328<br>00:39:35,679 –&gt; 00:39:42,679<br>Good. The third part would be quite industrious and constructive file system.</p>
<p>329<br>00:39:42,679 –&gt; 00:39:47,679<br>So after, you know, it knows that it’s actually it’s not a rule to pass the version of the file system.</p>
<p>330<br>00:39:47,679 –&gt; 00:39:51,679<br>It basically applies all the modifications and basically builds a file system tree.</p>
<p>331<br>00:39:51,679 –&gt; 00:39:53,679<br>You know, on the client.</p>
<p>332<br>00:39:53,679 –&gt; 00:39:59,679<br>And then, you know, perform for whatever operation it is wants to perform. So let’s say in the case of.</p>
<p>333<br>00:39:59,679 –&gt; 00:40:13,679<br>So let’s see what it will do is, you know, it will read, you know, off WY and append an entry to the log.</p>
<p>334<br>00:40:13,679 –&gt; 00:40:17,679<br>And site it.</p>
<p>335<br>00:40:17,679 –&gt; 00:40:25,679<br>So in the case, when it reads off WY, it will produce basically a signature and entry for this log entry.</p>
<p>336<br>00:40:25,679 –&gt; 00:40:37,679<br>And then it will be basically then, and then the final step in this year of protocol is it uploads the log to the file server.</p>
<p>337<br>00:40:37,679 –&gt; 00:40:42,679<br>And clearly this vertical is completely in practical.</p>
<p>338<br>00:40:42,679 –&gt; 00:40:53,679<br>And really what it is, it’s sort of more conceptual protocol to help us understand why we actually might even be successful in achieving security in the context of.</p>
<p>339<br>00:40:53,679 –&gt; 00:40:57,679<br>It’s, you know, wireless feature calls not only to진� Caleb.</p>
<p>340<br>00:40:57,679 –&gt; 00:41:03,679<br>And there’s that look on the盟 has to go friends birthdays for.</p>
<p>341<br>00:41:03,679 –&gt; 00:41:05,679<br>The City of istit zero and all updates.</p>
<p>342<br>00:41:05,679 –&gt; 00:41:08,679<br>And here’s what you can’t do.</p>
<p>343<br>00:41:08,679 –&gt; 00:41:09,679<br>This a conservative���.</p>
<p>344<br>00:41:09,679 –&gt; 00:41:11,679<br>I think it’s just takes some time on this about.</p>
<p>345<br>00:41:11,679 –&gt; 00:41:14,679<br>And than there’s, rather.</p>
<p>346<br>00:41:14,679 –&gt; 00:41:17,679<br>There’s a fair amount of community that post, more alcant prep for every closet.</p>
<p>347<br>00:41:17,679 –&gt; 00:41:20,799<br>And there’s a performance, but it will help us understand</p>
<p>348<br>00:41:22,639 –&gt; 00:41:26,319<br>when we look at the implementation of a scheme</p>
<p>349<br>00:41:26,319 –&gt; 00:41:28,839<br>where it actually has the same sort of properties</p>
<p>350<br>00:41:28,839 –&gt; 00:41:31,960<br>that they sort of conceptual design has.</p>
<p>351<br>00:41:31,960 –&gt; 00:41:35,319<br>And we’ll see later, for example, in the case of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>352<br>00:41:35,319 –&gt; 00:41:37,399<br>that really does actually have a log.</p>
<p>353<br>00:41:37,399 –&gt; 00:41:40,359<br>And since the beginning of time, we’ve all operations in it.</p>
<p>354<br>00:41:40,359 –&gt; 00:41:45,359<br>And so maybe it was a crazy idea, maybe in the context of 2004,</p>
<p>355<br>00:41:45,360 –&gt; 00:41:49,079<br>but people actually do have these sort of sign logs</p>
<p>356<br>00:41:49,079 –&gt; 00:41:50,840<br>and they really maintained it.</p>
<p>357<br>00:41:50,840 –&gt; 00:41:54,160<br>And so in that sense, it’s not only a big conceptual idea,</p>
<p>358<br>00:41:54,160 –&gt; 00:41:55,720<br>actually people do it in practice.</p>
<p>359<br>00:41:58,440 –&gt; 00:41:59,640<br>Any questions so far?</p>
<p>360<br>00:42:04,519 –&gt; 00:42:09,519<br>Okay, so the one thing that you’re probably</p>
<p>361<br>00:42:09,960 –&gt; 00:42:14,960<br>more wondering about that was proposed as a question</p>
<p>362<br>00:42:15,240 –&gt; 00:42:18,840<br>for the reading today is, what is up with these metrics?</p>
<p>363<br>00:42:18,840 –&gt; 00:42:21,840<br>Why are the fetches in the log two?</p>
<p>364<br>00:42:25,679 –&gt; 00:42:27,039<br>Because you might think, you know,</p>
<p>365<br>00:42:27,039 –&gt; 00:42:28,199<br>the only thing that we really care about,</p>
<p>366<br>00:42:28,199 –&gt; 00:42:31,360<br>like if we think about the way we care about it,</p>
<p>367<br>00:42:31,360 –&gt; 00:42:33,679<br>there’s only the modifications you have to be in the log,</p>
<p>368<br>00:42:33,679 –&gt; 00:42:34,800<br>because that actually other things</p>
<p>369<br>00:42:34,800 –&gt; 00:42:36,199<br>that actually modify the file system,</p>
<p>370<br>00:42:36,199 –&gt; 00:42:37,920<br>really modify this file system.</p>
<p>371<br>00:42:37,920 –&gt; 00:42:39,440<br>So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>372<br>00:42:41,400 –&gt; 00:42:44,320<br>And so I think I want to do a quick breakout here</p>
<p>373<br>00:42:44,480 –&gt; 00:42:46,200<br>and sort of, you can brainstorm each other,</p>
<p>374<br>00:42:46,200 –&gt; 00:42:49,160<br>but what you thought the answer to this particular question was,</p>
<p>375<br>00:42:49,160 –&gt; 00:42:54,160<br>and hopefully maybe this initial coverage of like a sunday,</p>
<p>376<br>00:42:56,200 –&gt; 00:42:59,280<br>you know, maybe hasn’t improved your understanding</p>
<p>377<br>00:42:59,280 –&gt; 00:43:01,480<br>and you can sort of figure out like what the answer is</p>
<p>378<br>00:43:01,480 –&gt; 00:43:02,840<br>or talk about something else.</p>
<p>379<br>00:43:02,840 –&gt; 00:43:06,880<br>So I would like to take a maybe do a five minute breakout room.</p>
<p>380<br>00:43:44,320 –&gt; 00:43:46,320<br>So I would like to take a few more questions.</p>
<p>381<br>00:43:46,320 –&gt; 00:43:48,320<br>I would like to ask you guys,</p>
<p>382<br>00:43:48,320 –&gt; 00:43:50,320<br>if you have any questions,</p>

<p>541<br>00:49:20,320 –&gt; 00:49:23,320<br>I could ask you guys a few numbers.</p>
<p>542<br>00:49:23,320 –&gt; 00:49:24,980<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>543<br>00:49:24,980 –&gt; 00:49:26,680<br>Okay, so what does it look like,</p>
<p>544<br>00:49:26,680 –&gt; 00:49:28,220<br>let’s start with homework questions.</p>
<p>545<br>00:49:29,160 –&gt; 00:49:30,160<br>We don’t have a question.</p>
<p>546<br>00:49:30,160 –&gt; 00:49:32,360<br>Why are the fetches in the law?</p>
<p>547<br>00:49:38,400 –&gt; 00:49:39,240<br>Anybody?</p>
<p>548<br>00:49:41,720 –&gt; 00:49:44,240<br>If you have a redone list ever,</p>
<p>549<br>00:49:44,240 –&gt; 00:49:45,480<br>if there are no fetches,</p>
<p>550<br>00:49:45,480 –&gt; 00:49:48,880<br>this the call system can give it anything.</p>
<p>551<br>00:49:48,880 –&gt; 00:49:50,280<br>Can it?</p>
<p>552<br>00:49:50,280 –&gt; 00:49:52,160<br>Can it give it because it,</p>
<p>553<br>00:49:52,159 –&gt; 00:49:53,879<br>because there are no fetches in the log,</p>
<p>554<br>00:49:53,879 –&gt; 00:49:58,079<br>that would mean that there are,</p>
<p>555<br>00:49:58,079 –&gt; 00:50:00,119<br>the, the,</p>
<p>556<br>00:50:00,119 –&gt; 00:50:04,799<br>the redone list service would not be doing a lot of the checks</p>
<p>557<br>00:50:04,799 –&gt; 00:50:06,079<br>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>558<br>00:50:06,079 –&gt; 00:50:09,679<br>So the, the go back in time, for example,</p>
<p>559<br>00:50:09,679 –&gt; 00:50:13,159<br>might maybe not work because it did not put anything</p>
<p>560<br>00:50:13,159 –&gt; 00:50:15,839<br>in the log because it’s only fetches.</p>
<p>561<br>00:50:15,839 –&gt; 00:50:16,679<br>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>562<br>00:50:16,679 –&gt; 00:50:17,519<br>Okay, good, good.</p>
<p>563<br>00:50:17,519 –&gt; 00:50:20,519<br>So I think you’re totally in the right track.</p>
<p>564<br>00:50:20,519 –&gt; 00:50:22,880<br>It was like trying to make it a little bit more precise</p>
<p>565<br>00:50:22,880 –&gt; 00:50:24,239<br>or more concrete.</p>
<p>566<br>00:50:24,239 –&gt; 00:50:25,440<br>I think it is correct.</p>
<p>567<br>00:50:25,440 –&gt; 00:50:27,159<br>So let’s assume this is the log looked like</p>
<p>568<br>00:50:27,159 –&gt; 00:50:29,119<br>and the C’s fetches are not in it.</p>
<p>569<br>00:50:30,280 –&gt; 00:50:31,759<br>And let’s, you know,</p>
<p>570<br>00:50:31,759 –&gt; 00:50:35,840<br>this is the log before I actually see downloads the log.</p>
<p>571<br>00:50:35,840 –&gt; 00:50:37,360<br>And so let’s say, you know, we’re,</p>
<p>572<br>00:50:37,360 –&gt; 00:50:38,719<br>see a fetish,</p>
<p>573<br>00:50:40,679 –&gt; 00:50:43,800<br>fetish, fetish, off the PY,</p>
<p>574<br>00:50:43,800 –&gt; 00:50:46,960<br>right, this is the file that was modified by eight.</p>
<p>575<br>00:50:46,960 –&gt; 00:50:49,320<br>And basically, but the server does.</p>
<p>576<br>00:50:50,280 –&gt; 00:50:54,240<br>The server instead of actually providing both</p>
<p>577<br>00:50:54,240 –&gt; 00:50:57,000<br>the modifications A and B because it has it, right,</p>
<p>578<br>00:50:57,000 –&gt; 00:50:59,720<br>which A and B were done with its modifications,</p>
<p>579<br>00:50:59,720 –&gt; 00:51:02,480<br>it sends the C,</p>
<p>580<br>00:51:05,280 –&gt; 00:51:06,519<br>basically prefix,</p>
<p>581<br>00:51:09,039 –&gt; 00:51:12,120<br>since the prefix, that excludes</p>
<p>582<br>00:51:13,920 –&gt; 00:51:16,000<br>the modifications to A and B.</p>
<p>583<br>00:51:17,000 –&gt; 00:51:20,159<br>So we’ve have mods A and B.</p>
<p>584<br>00:51:22,559 –&gt; 00:51:25,559<br>Right, and so C fetches this file,</p>
<p>585<br>00:51:25,559 –&gt; 00:51:26,960<br>it’s a fetish of the log.</p>
<p>586<br>00:51:26,960 –&gt; 00:51:29,480<br>And so there’s basically it’s this part of the log,</p>
<p>587<br>00:51:29,480 –&gt; 00:51:30,639<br>here’s the prefix.</p>
<p>588<br>00:51:34,159 –&gt; 00:51:36,639<br>C checks the signature,</p>
<p>589<br>00:51:36,639 –&gt; 00:51:39,440<br>checks whether it’s proceeding operations or in it.</p>
<p>590<br>00:51:39,440 –&gt; 00:51:41,519<br>And they’re all there because she hasn’t done</p>
<p>591<br>00:51:41,519 –&gt; 00:51:43,039<br>any other operation yet.</p>
<p>592<br>00:51:43,039 –&gt; 00:51:44,719<br>And so basically we’ll accept the log</p>
<p>593<br>00:51:45,559 –&gt; 00:51:47,919<br>and the log is it is or the prefix as it is.</p>
<p>594<br>00:51:47,919 –&gt; 00:51:50,879<br>And basically returns, you know, off the PY</p>
<p>595<br>00:51:50,879 –&gt; 00:51:54,519<br>to whatever application that is copying the software</p>
<p>596<br>00:51:54,519 –&gt; 00:51:56,319<br>into the machine that actually is going to run</p>
<p>597<br>00:51:56,319 –&gt; 00:51:58,199<br>the installed software.</p>
<p>598<br>00:51:58,199 –&gt; 00:52:00,199<br>So then see fetish,</p>
<p>599<br>00:52:04,199 –&gt; 00:52:05,199<br>negative PY.</p>
<p>600<br>00:52:08,679 –&gt; 00:52:11,079<br>And this time around the server</p>
<p>601<br>00:52:12,079 –&gt; 00:52:14,399<br>sends the whole log.</p>
<p>602<br>00:52:15,719 –&gt; 00:52:19,719<br>And you know, the C,</p>
<p>603<br>00:52:23,959 –&gt; 00:52:27,199<br>see looks at these entries and the valid log.</p>
<p>604<br>00:52:28,719 –&gt; 00:52:31,759<br>In some of our cases are usually in the prefix,</p>
<p>605<br>00:52:31,759 –&gt; 00:52:33,799<br>since we didn’t care about fetches,</p>
<p>606<br>00:52:33,799 –&gt; 00:52:35,079<br>it’s of course not in the log.</p>
<p>607<br>00:52:36,079 –&gt; 00:52:38,639<br>And so everything looks good.</p>
<p>608<br>00:52:38,639 –&gt; 00:52:40,639<br>These are valid modifications,</p>
<p>609<br>00:52:40,639 –&gt; 00:52:42,719<br>nothing has been changed.</p>
<p>610<br>00:52:42,719 –&gt; 00:52:47,719<br>And so we’ve had the fetish in the log,</p>
<p>611<br>00:52:47,959 –&gt; 00:52:50,599<br>see we’ll actually accept these log</p>
<p>612<br>00:52:50,599 –&gt; 00:52:53,759<br>and basically build a file system that has</p>
<p>613<br>00:52:56,159 –&gt; 00:52:58,759<br>that includes the modifications to the AMB</p>
<p>614<br>00:52:58,759 –&gt; 00:53:03,199<br>and returns the result to the application for backed up PY.</p>
<p>615<br>00:53:05,639 –&gt; 00:53:07,199<br>So that can install the machine</p>
<p>616<br>00:53:07,199 –&gt; 00:53:09,599<br>that actually is going to run the service.</p>
<p>617<br>00:53:09,599 –&gt; 00:53:10,799<br>And as you can see,</p>
<p>618<br>00:53:10,800 –&gt; 00:53:12,760<br>now we’re in sort of in a bad situation, right?</p>
<p>619<br>00:53:12,760 –&gt; 00:53:17,080<br>Because we took the old version of off-the-out PY</p>
<p>620<br>00:53:18,400 –&gt; 00:53:21,240<br>and the new version of thank you to those PYs.</p>
<p>621<br>00:53:23,120 –&gt; 00:53:25,840<br>And the one way you could think about this is that,</p>
<p>622<br>00:53:25,840 –&gt; 00:53:26,760<br>you know, from, you know,</p>
<p>623<br>00:53:26,760 –&gt; 00:53:28,680<br>C’s perspective,</p>
<p>624<br>00:53:28,680 –&gt; 00:53:30,560<br>what really seemed to be that happened is that,</p>
<p>625<br>00:53:30,560 –&gt; 00:53:31,560<br>well,</p>
<p>626<br>00:53:34,360 –&gt; 00:53:37,560<br>while you know, it was reading off the PY,</p>
<p>627<br>00:53:37,560 –&gt; 00:53:40,480<br>you know, there were concurrent modifications to AMB</p>
<p>628<br>00:53:40,639 –&gt; 00:53:42,280<br>and it just happened basically at the same time</p>
<p>629<br>00:53:42,280 –&gt; 00:53:43,960<br>or at least the server is pretending</p>
<p>630<br>00:53:43,960 –&gt; 00:53:45,760<br>it happened at the same time.</p>
<p>631<br>00:53:45,760 –&gt; 00:53:50,039<br>And so it gets confused or it can detect</p>
<p>632<br>00:53:50,039 –&gt; 00:53:52,800<br>that the fact these applications were did happen</p>
<p>633<br>00:53:52,800 –&gt; 00:53:53,960<br>before any time.</p>
<p>634<br>00:53:55,199 –&gt; 00:53:57,599<br>And so this is the problem that, you know,</p>
<p>635<br>00:53:57,599 –&gt; 00:53:59,519<br>basically putting the fetish in the log,</p>
<p>636<br>00:53:59,519 –&gt; 00:54:01,360<br>a solvus, solvus,</p>
<p>637<br>00:54:01,360 –&gt; 00:54:06,199<br>and let’s make that actually just also complete.</p>
<p>638<br>00:54:07,039 –&gt; 00:54:12,039<br>So C and Y actually do this problem with a solvus in that case?</p>
<p>639<br>00:54:14,480 –&gt; 00:54:16,199<br>Because I had a question.</p>
<p>640<br>00:54:16,199 –&gt; 00:54:17,039<br>Yep.</p>
<p>641<br>00:54:18,000 –&gt; 00:54:22,519<br>So I am having a little trouble understanding what the,</p>
<p>642<br>00:54:24,119 –&gt; 00:54:29,119<br>like sort of like the interface for fetching modify</p>
<p>643<br>00:54:29,839 –&gt; 00:54:30,679<br>is like what?</p>
<p>644<br>00:54:32,199 –&gt; 00:54:35,839<br>I thought you fetched pretty much like the whole tree</p>
<p>645<br>00:54:35,840 –&gt; 00:54:38,559<br>and had to rebuild the whole file system,</p>
<p>646<br>00:54:38,559 –&gt; 00:54:39,800<br>basic example.</p>
<p>647<br>00:54:40,800 –&gt; 00:54:45,039<br>But in this slide before you’re fetching like specific files.</p>
<p>648<br>00:54:45,039 –&gt; 00:54:49,559<br>Yeah, the server is the one that returns the log, correct?</p>
<p>649<br>00:54:49,559 –&gt; 00:54:52,800<br>And so the server can decide what entries they include.</p>
<p>650<br>00:54:52,800 –&gt; 00:54:53,640<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>651<br>00:54:53,640 –&gt; 00:54:56,320<br>And we’re seeing that it can’t really delete anything</p>
<p>652<br>00:54:56,320 –&gt; 00:54:57,600<br>out of the middle of the log, right?</p>
<p>653<br>00:54:57,600 –&gt; 00:54:59,240<br>That’s not really possible.</p>
<p>654<br>00:54:59,240 –&gt; 00:55:01,320<br>But it’s always in the prefix of the log</p>
<p>655<br>00:55:01,320 –&gt; 00:55:04,160<br>because the prefix is always consistent with itself.</p>
<p>656<br>00:55:04,160 –&gt; 00:55:05,000<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>657<br>00:55:05,000 –&gt; 00:55:08,159<br>And so in this first case, correct?</p>
<p>658<br>00:55:08,159 –&gt; 00:55:09,679<br>It sent the prefix.</p>
<p>659<br>00:55:09,679 –&gt; 00:55:11,840<br>And in the second case, it sent the whole log.</p>
<p>660<br>00:55:11,840 –&gt; 00:55:12,840<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>661<br>00:55:12,840 –&gt; 00:55:14,480<br>And so the server can decide to do that, right?</p>
<p>662<br>00:55:14,480 –&gt; 00:55:16,400<br>But it’s like nothing that the client can,</p>
<p>663<br>00:55:16,400 –&gt; 00:55:18,920<br>or lease it like so far, you know, we’ve discussed.</p>
<p>664<br>00:55:18,920 –&gt; 00:55:20,000<br>And there’s nothing that the client,</p>
<p>665<br>00:55:20,000 –&gt; 00:55:23,199<br>how the client can detect that it didn’t get like the whole log.</p>
<p>666<br>00:55:23,199 –&gt; 00:55:24,039<br>Right.</p>
<p>667<br>00:55:24,039 –&gt; 00:55:25,039<br>Right.</p>
<p>668<br>00:55:25,039 –&gt; 00:55:27,880<br>My question is more towards like what the interface is</p>
<p>669<br>00:55:27,880 –&gt; 00:55:30,679<br>for clients to use like fetch and modify.</p>
<p>670<br>00:55:30,679 –&gt; 00:55:33,840<br>Like like, because I thought initially I thought,</p>
<p>671<br>00:55:33,840 –&gt; 00:55:37,079<br>okay, like fetch, fetch is like the whole file system.</p>
<p>672<br>00:55:37,079 –&gt; 00:55:37,920<br>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>673<br>00:55:37,920 –&gt; 00:55:39,400<br>In fetch is a single file.</p>
<p>674<br>00:55:39,400 –&gt; 00:55:40,400<br>Okay.</p>
<p>675<br>00:55:40,400 –&gt; 00:55:43,720<br>And so basically what a fetch does is to get to the log,</p>
<p>676<br>00:55:43,720 –&gt; 00:55:45,240<br>like modification effects, okay.</p>
<p>677<br>00:55:45,240 –&gt; 00:55:48,360<br>So modifications are only operations that modify the file.</p>
<p>678<br>00:55:48,360 –&gt; 00:55:51,160<br>And like if you go back to a slight little bit earlier,</p>
<p>679<br>00:55:51,160 –&gt; 00:55:52,600<br>you know, in the modification record,</p>
<p>680<br>00:55:52,600 –&gt; 00:55:55,480<br>it’s such a specifically which file is being modified.</p>
<p>681<br>00:55:55,480 –&gt; 00:55:56,480<br>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>682<br>00:55:56,480 –&gt; 00:55:59,360<br>And you know, what’s being sent is similarly in the fetch,</p>
<p>683<br>00:55:59,360 –&gt; 00:56:01,920<br>actually it says which file likes this client’s software.</p>
<p>684<br>00:56:02,920 –&gt; 00:56:03,920<br>Okay.</p>
<p>685<br>00:56:03,920 –&gt; 00:56:08,920<br>And then so, so, so for fetch like a client goes through the log,</p>
<p>686<br>00:56:11,440 –&gt; 00:56:13,280<br>but only looks at.</p>
<p>687<br>00:56:13,280 –&gt; 00:56:15,159<br>Yeah, the final thing it does is actually read the file</p>
<p>688<br>00:56:15,159 –&gt; 00:56:16,720<br>that actually is looking for.</p>
<p>689<br>00:56:16,720 –&gt; 00:56:19,559<br>Okay, but doesn’t check every single entry in the log.</p>
<p>690<br>00:56:19,559 –&gt; 00:56:21,519<br>Anyways, for the signature or.</p>
<p>691<br>00:56:21,519 –&gt; 00:56:22,920<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>692<br>00:56:22,920 –&gt; 00:56:25,760<br>Okay, first step is always checking the whole log.</p>
<p>693<br>00:56:25,760 –&gt; 00:56:26,760<br>Go for it.</p>
<p>694<br>00:56:26,760 –&gt; 00:56:29,200<br>And make sure that your last, you know,</p>
<p>695<br>00:56:29,199 –&gt; 00:56:31,679<br>operations in it where it’s a fetch or modify.</p>
<p>696<br>00:56:31,679 –&gt; 00:56:32,519<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>697<br>00:56:32,519 –&gt; 00:56:34,679<br>Although in this broken scheme, you know,</p>
<p>698<br>00:56:34,679 –&gt; 00:56:36,799<br>we drop the fetch.</p>
<p>699<br>00:56:36,799 –&gt; 00:56:40,039<br>It applies all the checks all the signatures.</p>
<p>700<br>00:56:40,039 –&gt; 00:56:43,119<br>And then it builds up the file system.</p>
<p>701<br>00:56:43,119 –&gt; 00:56:45,199<br>By replaying the log from the beginning of the time</p>
<p>702<br>00:56:45,199 –&gt; 00:56:46,359<br>and get a file system.</p>
<p>703<br>00:56:46,359 –&gt; 00:56:48,000<br>And then it does its operation.</p>
<p>704<br>00:56:48,000 –&gt; 00:56:50,439<br>And so in this case, the operation is actually fetched off</p>
<p>705<br>00:56:50,439 –&gt; 00:56:52,639<br>of the PY is basically reading it.</p>
<p>706<br>00:56:52,639 –&gt; 00:56:53,480<br>Okay.</p>
<p>707<br>00:56:53,480 –&gt; 00:56:55,319<br>The reason we, you know, basically we’ve talked about fetching</p>
<p>708<br>00:56:55,319 –&gt; 00:56:58,199<br>modify is because all operations are basically falling</p>
<p>709<br>00:56:58,199 –&gt; 00:57:02,759<br>one or two camps, either it’s a fetch or it is a modification</p>
<p>710<br>00:57:02,759 –&gt; 00:57:05,079<br>operation, like writing a file, creating a file,</p>
<p>711<br>00:57:05,079 –&gt; 00:57:07,319<br>there’s a whole modification operations.</p>
<p>712<br>00:57:07,319 –&gt; 00:57:09,480<br>The fetch operations are reading a file,</p>
<p>713<br>00:57:09,480 –&gt; 00:57:13,919<br>maybe Allison’s directory, status file, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>714<br>00:57:13,919 –&gt; 00:57:14,759<br>Okay.</p>
<p>715<br>00:57:14,759 –&gt; 00:57:19,239<br>And then the modify is also like a modified,</p>
<p>716<br>00:57:19,239 –&gt; 00:57:23,319<br>like doesn’t fetch the, also fetches the log,</p>
<p>717<br>00:57:23,319 –&gt; 00:57:26,359<br>but then builds the file system.</p>
<p>718<br>00:57:26,359 –&gt; 00:57:27,199<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>719<br>00:57:27,599 –&gt; 00:57:28,159<br>The fetch is here.</p>
<p>720<br>00:57:28,159 –&gt; 00:57:29,879<br>I’m using fetch, I guess in two ways.</p>
<p>721<br>00:57:29,879 –&gt; 00:57:33,239<br>One, to describe read only operations and actually to get me</p>
<p>722<br>00:57:33,239 –&gt; 00:57:36,359<br>to obtain or receive the log from the server.</p>
<p>723<br>00:57:36,359 –&gt; 00:57:37,199<br>Okay.</p>
<p>724<br>00:57:37,199 –&gt; 00:57:40,519<br>But then modify, modify is also one single file.</p>
<p>725<br>00:57:40,519 –&gt; 00:57:41,359<br>Yes.</p>
<p>726<br>00:57:41,359 –&gt; 00:57:43,359<br>Yeah. For every modification in the file system,</p>
<p>727<br>00:57:43,359 –&gt; 00:57:45,079<br>you’re going to have a log entry.</p>
<p>728<br>00:57:45,079 –&gt; 00:57:45,919<br>Okay.</p>
<p>729<br>00:57:47,359 –&gt; 00:57:48,679<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>730<br>00:57:48,679 –&gt; 00:57:50,839<br>Sorry, I also have a question.</p>
<p>731<br>00:57:50,839 –&gt; 00:57:55,839<br>I don’t really understand why this scenario is a problem.</p>
<p>732<br>00:57:56,840 –&gt; 00:58:00,320<br>Because as you said, it’s possible,</p>
<p>733<br>00:58:00,320 –&gt; 00:58:01,960<br>like from the perspective of the client,</p>
<p>734<br>00:58:01,960 –&gt; 00:58:08,039<br>it may well be that AMB got created or modified</p>
<p>735<br>00:58:08,039 –&gt; 00:58:09,720<br>from the last fetch.</p>
<p>736<br>00:58:09,720 –&gt; 00:58:09,960<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>737<br>00:58:09,960 –&gt; 00:58:11,360<br>In principle, it could have happened,</p>
<p>738<br>00:58:11,360 –&gt; 00:58:11,880<br>correct?</p>
<p>739<br>00:58:11,880 –&gt; 00:58:13,079<br>It was a coding modification.</p>
<p>740<br>00:58:13,079 –&gt; 00:58:17,320<br>We do know, because we were sort of look from the top.</p>
<p>741<br>00:58:17,320 –&gt; 00:58:20,039<br>And we know that basically see you rent the file</p>
<p>742<br>00:58:20,039 –&gt; 00:58:21,680<br>after AMB modified it.</p>
<p>743<br>00:58:22,920 –&gt; 00:58:25,519<br>But the server can pretend, as if it actually happened</p>
<p>744<br>00:58:25,519 –&gt; 00:58:26,519<br>concurrently.</p>
<p>745<br>00:58:26,519 –&gt; 00:58:29,519<br>And in a second, we’ll see that if we stick the fetching</p>
<p>746<br>00:58:29,519 –&gt; 00:58:32,519<br>in the log, the server cannot create to do that.</p>
<p>747<br>00:58:32,519 –&gt; 00:58:36,519<br>Okay. But even if the server pretends that,</p>
<p>748<br>00:58:36,519 –&gt; 00:58:40,519<br>is that even a problem?</p>
<p>749<br>00:58:40,519 –&gt; 00:58:41,519<br>Does it break anything?</p>
<p>750<br>00:58:41,519 –&gt; 00:58:42,519<br>Because the client can…</p>
<p>751<br>00:58:42,519 –&gt; 00:58:43,519<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>752<br>00:58:43,519 –&gt; 00:58:44,519<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>753<br>00:58:44,519 –&gt; 00:58:45,519<br>This is an example where it shows that it breaks something,</p>
<p>754<br>00:58:45,519 –&gt; 00:58:46,519<br>correct?</p>
<p>755<br>00:58:46,519 –&gt; 00:58:50,519<br>Like step one, you know, see fetch is off.py.</p>
<p>756<br>00:58:50,519 –&gt; 00:58:53,519<br>The server gave it one, you know, as part of fetch,</p>
<p>757<br>00:58:53,519 –&gt; 00:58:55,519<br>it gave it the prefix.</p>
<p>758<br>00:58:55,519 –&gt; 00:58:57,519<br>And so the client conscripted the file system,</p>
<p>759<br>00:58:57,519 –&gt; 00:59:01,519<br>executed the operation, returned off.py to the application</p>
<p>760<br>00:59:01,519 –&gt; 00:59:04,519<br>and installed the server on the machine just to make a very</p>
<p>761<br>00:59:04,519 –&gt; 00:59:05,519<br>crisp.</p>
<p>762<br>00:59:05,519 –&gt; 00:59:09,519<br>So now the first reading off.py, that operation is done, right?</p>
<p>763<br>00:59:09,519 –&gt; 00:59:14,519<br>Finished already executed and has installed the old version</p>
<p>764<br>00:59:14,519 –&gt; 00:59:17,519<br>of off.py on the machine.</p>
<p>765<br>00:59:17,519 –&gt; 00:59:22,519<br>Then the client, you know, confectors banged up.py.</p>
<p>766<br>00:59:22,519 –&gt; 00:59:26,519<br>Now the server actually, the client or the application</p>
<p>767<br>00:59:26,519 –&gt; 00:59:28,519<br>wants to read bank.py.</p>
<p>768<br>00:59:28,519 –&gt; 00:59:30,519<br>So the client fetches the log from the server,</p>
<p>769<br>00:59:30,519 –&gt; 00:59:32,519<br>or asks the server, please give me the log.</p>
<p>770<br>00:59:32,519 –&gt; 00:59:35,519<br>The server disdain around gets the whole log.</p>
<p>771<br>00:59:35,519 –&gt; 00:59:37,519<br>And not just the prefix.</p>
<p>772<br>00:59:37,519 –&gt; 00:59:38,519<br>Yeah, but…</p>
<p>773<br>00:59:38,519 –&gt; 00:59:41,519<br>The line it, you know, builds up the whole file system</p>
<p>774<br>00:59:41,519 –&gt; 00:59:44,519<br>and returns banged up.py to the application.</p>
<p>775<br>00:59:44,519 –&gt; 00:59:46,519<br>But in like, I…</p>
<p>776<br>00:59:46,519 –&gt; 00:59:49,519<br>Wouldn’t this happen in an incorrect implementation of the client?</p>
<p>777<br>00:59:49,519 –&gt; 00:59:51,519<br>Because if the client finds that,</p>
<p>778<br>00:59:51,519 –&gt; 00:59:55,519<br>receive the log and it sees an additional modification on a,</p>
<p>779<br>00:59:55,519 –&gt; 01:00:00,519<br>if the client knows that it’s logic depends on a and b being</p>
<p>780<br>01:00:00,519 –&gt; 01:00:03,519<br>in sync, it will also fetch a again.</p>
<p>781<br>01:00:03,519 –&gt; 01:00:04,519<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>782<br>01:00:04,519 –&gt; 01:00:09,519<br>Okay, so the question, see doesn’t know correct that.</p>
<p>783<br>01:00:09,519 –&gt; 01:00:13,519<br>Is see, okay.</p>
<p>784<br>01:00:13,519 –&gt; 01:00:16,519<br>In this particular scenario.</p>
<p>785<br>01:00:16,519 –&gt; 01:00:19,519<br>We’re trying to establish whether actually, you know,</p>
<p>786<br>01:00:19,519 –&gt; 01:00:21,519<br>see can determine whether action the modification happened</p>
<p>787<br>01:00:21,519 –&gt; 01:00:24,519<br>concurrently or in the past, you know, before and</p>
<p>788<br>01:00:24,519 –&gt; 01:00:25,519<br>red.</p>
<p>789<br>01:00:25,519 –&gt; 01:00:27,519<br>You know, we want to be in the case that it actually happened</p>
<p>790<br>01:00:27,519 –&gt; 01:00:29,519<br>in the past because actually really happened in the past.</p>
<p>791<br>01:00:29,519 –&gt; 01:00:31,519<br>But, you know, what this server does,</p>
<p>792<br>01:00:31,519 –&gt; 01:00:35,519<br>it just pretends that the modification actually happened</p>
<p>793<br>01:00:35,519 –&gt; 01:00:39,519<br>concurrently with actually see operations.</p>
<p>794<br>01:00:39,519 –&gt; 01:00:43,519<br>And see doesn’t really have any way to detect that.</p>
<p>795<br>01:00:43,519 –&gt; 01:00:46,519<br>Other than the new, you know, maybe that, you know,</p>
<p>796<br>01:00:46,519 –&gt; 01:00:49,519<br>there should have been a modification for a and b together.</p>
<p>797<br>01:00:49,519 –&gt; 01:00:52,519<br>But that only could have known if there was sort of communication</p>
<p>798<br>01:00:52,519 –&gt; 01:00:54,519<br>between see and a and b.</p>
<p>799<br>01:00:54,519 –&gt; 01:00:56,519<br>And second, let’s talk about that in a second.</p>
<p>800<br>01:00:56,519 –&gt; 01:00:58,519<br>If see had not talked to a and b,</p>
<p>801<br>01:00:58,519 –&gt; 01:01:01,519<br>and you know, it could have gotten the good,</p>
<p>802<br>01:01:01,519 –&gt; 01:01:04,519<br>could have ended up in this scenario where it installed the old</p>
<p>803<br>01:01:04,519 –&gt; 01:01:07,519<br>version and of off that divine the new version of bank that</p>
<p>804<br>01:01:07,519 –&gt; 01:01:08,519<br>be why.</p>
<p>805<br>01:01:08,519 –&gt; 01:01:11,519<br>And we’ll see in a second that we stick the fetus in,</p>
<p>806<br>01:01:11,519 –&gt; 01:01:14,519<br>then this problem just cannot happen.</p>
<p>807<br>01:01:14,519 –&gt; 01:01:19,519<br>So when he asked if we timestamp everything, then, you know,</p>
<p>808<br>01:01:19,519 –&gt; 01:01:25,519<br>we could detect things, hold that five for a second.</p>
<p>809<br>01:01:25,519 –&gt; 01:01:29,519<br>Okay, let’s look at the, the VIT fetus scenario, right?</p>
<p>810<br>01:01:29,519 –&gt; 01:01:32,519<br>So see what, what actually happens in that case.</p>
<p>811<br>01:01:32,519 –&gt; 01:01:36,519<br>So client fetus.</p>
<p>812<br>01:01:36,519 –&gt; 01:01:41,519<br>What is the fetus of off the Y?</p>
<p>813<br>01:01:41,519 –&gt; 01:01:48,519<br>Oops, what happened now?</p>
<p>814<br>01:01:48,519 –&gt; 01:01:51,519<br>To hold in a second.</p>
<p>815<br>01:01:51,519 –&gt; 01:01:53,519<br>Something went wrong.</p>
<p>816<br>01:01:53,519 –&gt; 01:01:56,519<br>I presume we nobody can see you.</p>
<p>817<br>01:01:56,519 –&gt; 01:02:04,519<br>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>818<br>01:02:04,519 –&gt; 01:02:10,519<br>It’s coming back.</p>
<p>819<br>01:02:10,519 –&gt; 01:02:32,519<br>I definitely feel today there’s a busy team component to a 24.</p>
<p>820<br>01:02:32,519 –&gt; 01:02:35,519<br>Okay, make your stocks share in screen for a second.</p>
<p>821<br>01:03:02,519 –&gt; 01:03:22,519<br>Okay, let’s see.</p>
<p>822<br>01:03:22,519 –&gt; 01:03:32,519<br>Okay, let’s see.</p>
<p>823<br>01:03:32,519 –&gt; 01:03:38,519<br>Okay, so back to this example, where now the fetus are in the log,</p>
<p>824<br>01:03:38,519 –&gt; 01:03:43,519<br>see fetus the off the Y.</p>
<p>825<br>01:03:43,519 –&gt; 01:03:52,519<br>So, see if it’s for just.</p>
<p>826<br>01:03:52,519 –&gt; 01:04:03,519<br>Fetchers off the PY, the server, you know, since the prefix.</p>
<p>827<br>01:04:03,519 –&gt; 01:04:07,519<br>So basically since, you know, these modifications correctly,</p>
<p>828<br>01:04:07,519 –&gt; 01:04:10,519<br>just the server can just return whatever it likes.</p>
<p>829<br>01:04:10,519 –&gt; 01:04:15,519<br>And you know, in this new plan, correct, where the fetus actually are being logged,</p>
<p>830<br>01:04:15,519 –&gt; 01:04:20,519<br>then see construct the file system using a and B.</p>
<p>831<br>01:04:20,519 –&gt; 01:04:25,519<br>And then returns that of course, you know, off the PY to the client,</p>
<p>832<br>01:04:25,519 –&gt; 01:04:28,519<br>or to the application.</p>
<p>833<br>01:04:28,519 –&gt; 01:04:36,519<br>And then it adds a fetch to the log.</p>
<p>834<br>01:04:36,519 –&gt; 01:04:42,519<br>And then uploads that log.</p>
<p>835<br>01:04:42,519 –&gt; 01:04:43,519<br>Through the server.</p>
<p>836<br>01:04:43,519 –&gt; 01:04:46,519<br>And then, you know, the.</p>
<p>837<br>01:04:46,519 –&gt; 01:04:52,519<br>It does a fetch off, you know, banked up the PY.</p>
<p>838<br>01:04:52,519 –&gt; 01:04:57,519<br>And, you know, the server, you know, in our previous example,</p>
<p>839<br>01:04:57,519 –&gt; 01:05:02,519<br>the first attempt to set just the prefix.</p>
<p>840<br>01:05:02,519 –&gt; 01:05:09,519<br>Now, you know, because of the now the client sends the whole thing.</p>
<p>841<br>01:05:09,519 –&gt; 01:05:13,519<br>Right, so it sends the whole log.</p>
<p>842<br>01:05:13,519 –&gt; 01:05:18,519<br>And if, but if the modifications are not in it.</p>
<p>843<br>01:05:18,519 –&gt; 01:05:22,519<br>So, and we’ll have to send the whole log, well, to send the whole log,</p>
<p>844<br>01:05:22,519 –&gt; 01:05:24,519<br>it must include the fetch from C.</p>
<p>845<br>01:05:24,519 –&gt; 01:05:25,519<br>Right.</p>
<p>846<br>01:05:25,519 –&gt; 01:05:27,519<br>And so,</p>
<p>847<br>01:05:27,519 –&gt; 01:05:32,519<br>and if it doesn’t, you know, send the fetch we see.</p>
<p>848<br>01:05:32,519 –&gt; 01:05:37,519<br>It actually sees that this C is not actually not there.</p>
<p>849<br>01:05:37,519 –&gt; 01:05:39,519<br>The read operation.</p>
<p>850<br>01:05:39,519 –&gt; 01:05:42,519<br>And basically the.</p>
<p>851<br>01:05:42,519 –&gt; 01:05:47,519<br>Climb will reject the log because actually it’s own fetch operation is actually not in it.</p>
<p>852<br>01:05:47,519 –&gt; 01:05:50,519<br>So it is not possible for the.</p>
<p>853<br>01:05:50,519 –&gt; 01:05:58,519<br>And then, you know, the server to pretend, you know, that to send the log later on because actually the new log should have included that fetch operation.</p>
<p>854<br>01:05:58,519 –&gt; 01:06:00,519<br>That was in it.</p>
<p>855<br>01:06:00,519 –&gt; 01:06:06,519<br>And the upgrade the C or the server cannot splice that fetch operation into here.</p>
<p>856<br>01:06:06,519 –&gt; 01:06:09,519<br>To make it consistent what actually happened before.</p>
<p>857<br>01:06:09,519 –&gt; 01:06:11,519<br>Because that would be detected.</p>
<p>858<br>01:06:11,519 –&gt; 01:06:18,519<br>Because, you know, the modifications on the record of AMD are not wouldn’t wouldn’t check out.</p>
<p>859<br>01:06:18,519 –&gt; 01:06:26,519<br>Okay. So basically what what this really does is to sort of step back instead you can think about this attack that.</p>
<p>860<br>01:06:26,519 –&gt; 01:06:32,519<br>The server sort of pretends that the modification to the AMD happened concurrently with the C reading it.</p>
<p>861<br>01:06:32,519 –&gt; 01:06:37,519<br>Even though we know that actually it’s not the case and by sticking the fetches in it.</p>
<p>862<br>01:06:37,519 –&gt; 01:06:43,519<br>The attack cannot happen.</p>
<p>863<br>01:06:43,519 –&gt; 01:06:46,519<br>I have two questions.</p>
<p>864<br>01:06:46,519 –&gt; 01:06:53,519<br>Maybe first just if you could like define for consistency and the fetch modified consistency.</p>
<p>865<br>01:06:53,519 –&gt; 01:06:56,519<br>And then the second is in this example.</p>
<p>866<br>01:06:56,519 –&gt; 01:07:04,519<br>So what exactly stopping the server from placing the fetch in the right place of the log.</p>
<p>867<br>01:07:04,519 –&gt; 01:07:10,519<br>Because remember every log entry coverage always preceding entries.</p>
<p>868<br>01:07:10,519 –&gt; 01:07:18,519<br>So the server could not splice that you know fetch after the prefix before the modifications of AMD.</p>
<p>869<br>01:07:18,519 –&gt; 01:07:24,519<br>So let’s say it only wants to send the modification of a knows the hash of modification of everything preceding it.</p>
<p>870<br>01:07:24,519 –&gt; 01:07:29,519<br>And then it could insert like the fetch to see there because it knows that.</p>
<p>871<br>01:07:29,519 –&gt; 01:07:31,519<br>It could say hash of that.</p>
<p>872<br>01:07:31,519 –&gt; 01:07:36,519<br>Yeah, but then it couldn’t send the modification to be.</p>
<p>873<br>01:07:36,519 –&gt; 01:07:44,519<br>Because the modification would be you know is directly after a and so any must and so he can’t splice it between a and b either.</p>
<p>874<br>01:07:44,519 –&gt; 01:07:49,519<br>I see.</p>
<p>875<br>01:07:49,519 –&gt; 01:07:55,519<br>Sorry. And what was the problem with having it where it is in the picture.</p>
<p>876<br>01:07:55,519 –&gt; 01:08:05,519<br>Well, I’m learning this and out of pictures perfect. It’s fine. Right. And in fact, you know, this basically suggests you know that the fetch of C actually included the modification of a B like the blue was the real log.</p>
<p>877<br>01:08:05,519 –&gt; 01:08:18,520<br>And we have the fashion to see in it and you know the everything’s going to be perfect.</p>
<p>878<br>01:08:18,520 –&gt; 01:08:22,520<br>So just to clarify the definition of for consistency.</p>
<p>879<br>01:08:22,520 –&gt; 01:08:23,520<br>Hold on. Hold a second.</p>
<p>880<br>01:08:23,520 –&gt; 01:08:26,520<br>Let’s just topic with this life.</p>
<p>881<br>01:08:26,520 –&gt; 01:08:30,520<br>I haven’t talked about the definition of for kisses yet. I’m going to do that right now.</p>
<p>882<br>01:08:30,520 –&gt; 01:08:33,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>883<br>01:08:33,520 –&gt; 01:08:44,520<br>So we’re talking about for consistency.</p>
<p>884<br>01:08:44,520 –&gt; 01:08:51,520<br>So, so what we’ve seen right so far is that the server cannot really manipulate the law.</p>
<p>885<br>01:08:51,520 –&gt; 01:08:54,520<br>It can only sort of send prefixes or it can hide parts.</p>
<p>886<br>01:08:54,520 –&gt; 01:08:55,520<br>It can hide.</p>
<p>887<br>01:08:55,520 –&gt; 01:08:58,520<br>It can send the prefix back to the client.</p>
<p>888<br>01:08:58,520 –&gt; 01:09:06,520<br>And it can’t really modify the law. So it just basically has an opportunity to do you know sort of show different logs to different clients.</p>
<p>889<br>01:09:06,520 –&gt; 01:09:10,520<br>And that is basically what for consistency is.</p>
<p>890<br>01:09:10,520 –&gt; 01:09:20,520<br>And so it cannot provide you know, so the kind of the server cannot provide the type of consistency stuff we’ve seen so far in the past, namely like linearizability and external consistency and things like that.</p>
<p>891<br>01:09:20,520 –&gt; 01:09:21,520<br>That’s just not possible.</p>
<p>892<br>01:09:21,520 –&gt; 01:09:26,520<br>But it can provide us with what the paper calls are introduces is for consistency.</p>
<p>893<br>01:09:26,520 –&gt; 01:09:30,520<br>And let me abstract a little bit away and explain what that is.</p>
<p>894<br>01:09:30,520 –&gt; 01:09:35,520<br>So let’s say we have you know client a we have the server s.</p>
<p>895<br>01:09:35,520 –&gt; 01:09:39,520<br>And you know, it has a log.</p>
<p>896<br>01:09:39,520 –&gt; 01:09:45,520<br>Let’s say I’m just going to abstract everything away as entries a DC and D and eight.</p>
<p>897<br>01:09:45,520 –&gt; 01:09:51,520<br>And you know, a you know, whatever maybe you know, kind of that entry to the log.</p>
<p>898<br>01:09:51,520 –&gt; 01:09:56,520<br>And you know, and that’s basically it.</p>
<p>899<br>01:09:56,520 –&gt; 01:10:00,520<br>And you know, maybe we have another client B.</p>
<p>900<br>01:10:00,520 –&gt; 01:10:08,520<br>And what the server can do is sort of give the other client a completely different view of the world.</p>
<p>901<br>01:10:08,520 –&gt; 01:10:11,520<br>And basically have another copy of the law.</p>
<p>902<br>01:10:11,520 –&gt; 01:10:17,520<br>Where it’s own copy or give it the different copy of the log example, maybe that log contains direct at a.</p>
<p>903<br>01:10:17,520 –&gt; 01:10:27,520<br>But then every operation of the dust, you know, goes into this log, you know, B1, B2, maybe even some operations from other clients that also get this view and of in this log.</p>
<p>904<br>01:10:27,520 –&gt; 01:10:36,520<br>But they’re not actually shown to a you know, a basically have you know, a made actually also add more entries to the log maybe it had BCD and E.</p>
<p>905<br>01:10:36,520 –&gt; 01:10:39,520<br>And those are not actually shown to be.</p>
<p>906<br>01:10:39,520 –&gt; 01:10:47,520<br>And so these two logs to the world view of a, you know, looks completely consistent because it’s unaware of any of these changes.</p>
<p>907<br>01:10:47,520 –&gt; 01:10:54,520<br>And to be, you know, this log looks completely consistent because they’re really aware of any A changes, right?</p>
<p>908<br>01:10:54,520 –&gt; 01:11:08,520<br>And in this model of the world, the only sure shared communication place that is there is the server, you know, that is sort of the, you know, the thing that you’re of shows, you know, what actually is the state of the system.</p>
<p>909<br>01:11:08,520 –&gt; 01:11:17,520<br>And one way you can think about it is like in terms that we’ve talked about before, it’s sort of like a split brain.</p>
<p>910<br>01:11:17,520 –&gt; 01:11:29,520<br>So, you know, we, you know, A gets the C1 view of the world, you know, cooked up by by a log that’s consistent with a view and you know, B, you know, it gets another view of the world.</p>
<p>911<br>01:11:29,520 –&gt; 01:11:33,520<br>And basically the server is just keeps them sort of carefully separate.</p>
<p>912<br>01:11:33,520 –&gt; 01:11:40,520<br>And then for a can pretend that, you know, A is looking one, you know, she’s left looking inside of its brain, B.</p>
<p>913<br>01:11:40,520 –&gt; 01:11:43,520<br>He’s actually the right sign of S is great.</p>
<p>914<br>01:11:43,520 –&gt; 01:11:45,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>915<br>01:11:45,520 –&gt; 01:11:49,520<br>What’s that makes sense?</p>
<p>916<br>01:11:49,520 –&gt; 01:12:02,520<br>So that’s sort of what you know, basically they’re saying is like, you know, we can’t really do better than for consistency because it’s always possible for the server to, to basically copy of the log.</p>
<p>917<br>01:12:02,520 –&gt; 01:12:07,520<br>And then from then on, you know, present different views to these clients.</p>
<p>918<br>01:12:07,520 –&gt; 01:12:14,520<br>Now, S could not merge the two logs again, correct? You know, these logs have to be separate for, you know, for A and B.</p>
<p>919<br>01:12:14,520 –&gt; 01:12:20,520<br>Because it can be, it’s impossible for S to sort of take, you know, the logs, you know, let them grow for a while.</p>
<p>920<br>01:12:20,520 –&gt; 01:12:23,520<br>And then basically splice these two logs together again.</p>
<p>921<br>01:12:23,520 –&gt; 01:12:31,520<br>Because, you know, the, because these entries, you know, protect all these preceding entries, the entries, protect all the preceding entries with those.</p>
<p>922<br>01:12:31,520 –&gt; 01:12:34,520<br>And so you can’t like put them back together.</p>
<p>923<br>01:12:34,520 –&gt; 01:12:41,520<br>And because the second you wouldn’t check out because the second years, always cover the current entry, for all the preceding entries.</p>
<p>924<br>01:12:41,520 –&gt; 01:12:51,520<br>And so the only thing that they are basically doing at the server can do is basically split the world for the world into different, into two different logs.</p>
<p>925<br>01:12:51,520 –&gt; 01:13:01,520<br>And then the common log in the beginning, then the server forks them. And now that, you know, A and B basically operate in different worlds.</p>
<p>926<br>01:13:01,520 –&gt; 01:13:09,520<br>And so that’s sort of the definition of fork consistency. And that’s basically the best, you know, this particular file system, this, this particular system can do.</p>
<p>927<br>01:13:09,520 –&gt; 01:13:15,520<br>If there’s the only communication actually happens between S.</p>
<p>928<br>01:13:15,520 –&gt; 01:13:22,520<br>And the code is actually, by the way, that’s sort of fork consistency is good enough for our particular applications you keep it correct.</p>
<p>929<br>01:13:22,520 –&gt; 01:13:29,520<br>Because either the server shows the old version, you know, without A and B.</p>
<p>930<br>01:13:29,520 –&gt; 01:13:38,520<br>Or, you know, the server shows the S, you know, the modification with A and B.</p>
<p>931<br>01:13:38,520 –&gt; 01:13:44,520<br>And you do, you know, it seems like you know, maybe this is actually a problem. You know, how do you detect forks?</p>
<p>932<br>01:13:44,520 –&gt; 01:13:52,520<br>And how could you.</p>
<p>933<br>01:13:52,520 –&gt; 01:13:57,520<br>So how do you do tech forks? Well, there should have two schemes that the sort of paper mentions.</p>
<p>934<br>01:13:57,520 –&gt; 01:14:10,520<br>One is out of band communication.</p>
<p>935<br>01:14:10,520 –&gt; 01:14:12,520<br>And this is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>936<br>01:14:12,520 –&gt; 01:14:16,520<br>If you know, at A and B ever talk to each other.</p>
<p>937<br>01:14:16,520 –&gt; 01:14:22,520<br>And for example, ask each other, hey, what if you’re last entering the log and they get different answers.</p>
<p>938<br>01:14:22,520 –&gt; 01:14:25,520<br>They know, you know, that they have been forked.</p>
<p>939<br>01:14:25,520 –&gt; 01:14:32,520<br>And because either they, you know, they could have different answers, but like at least one should be the prefix of the other.</p>
<p>940<br>01:14:32,520 –&gt; 01:14:40,520<br>And if that’s not the case, then they know that they’re actually being that people fork.</p>
<p>941<br>01:14:40,520 –&gt; 01:14:52,520<br>So that’s one possible scenario that they’re discussing the paper is basically share, you know, the client’s periodically exchanged the last log entries.</p>
<p>942<br>01:14:52,520 –&gt; 01:14:54,520<br>The last entry in their log.</p>
<p>943<br>01:14:54,520 –&gt; 01:15:03,520<br>Another solution, which I can use mentioned in the chat is, you know, introduce what they call sort of trusted machine.</p>
<p>944<br>01:15:03,520 –&gt; 01:15:08,520<br>And that is a timestamp box.</p>
<p>945<br>01:15:08,520 –&gt; 01:15:17,520<br>And basically like every, you know, few seconds, you know, it actually ends at some timestamp to the log.</p>
<p>946<br>01:15:17,520 –&gt; 01:15:24,520<br>And every client knows that that, you know, basically, maybe it’s a file in the file system that just contains, you know, the current time.</p>
<p>947<br>01:15:24,520 –&gt; 01:15:35,520<br>The timestamp box, you know, every couple seconds, time stamp box updates that file, the clients read that file and they know there should be a new modification like every couple seconds.</p>
<p>948<br>01:15:35,520 –&gt; 01:15:45,520<br>And that basically, you know, that that fork that contains the timestamp box is sort of the fork that the clients.</p>
<p>949<br>01:15:45,520 –&gt; 01:15:52,520<br>The server actually has to present to the clients.</p>
<p>950<br>01:15:53,520 –&gt; 01:15:56,520<br>So that’s the two things that actually the paper discusses.</p>
<p>951<br>01:15:56,520 –&gt; 01:16:06,520<br>And what’s sort of interesting and we’ll see on Tuesday is that this, you know, this whole fork detection and fork resolution approach is sort of a key problem basically in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>952<br>01:16:06,520 –&gt; 01:16:15,520<br>And we, when we’re talking Tuesday about Bitcoin, you know, we see a way basically to settle on a fork.</p>
<p>953<br>01:16:15,520 –&gt; 01:16:28,520<br>So even if the file system or the server, the, the, the, the Byzantine servers actually have created a forks, you know, Bitcoin basically has a way of deciding, well, we’re going to use the consensus on like which fork we’re going to actually proceed with.</p>
<p>954<br>01:16:29,520 –&gt; 01:16:38,520<br>So we’ll live that up until Tuesday, but here sort of a connection between, you know, some there and actually a bit point.</p>
<p>955<br>01:16:40,520 –&gt; 01:16:42,520<br>Any questions about this.</p>
<p>956<br>01:16:46,520 –&gt; 01:16:49,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>957<br>01:16:49,520 –&gt; 01:16:50,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>958<br>01:16:50,520 –&gt; 01:16:51,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>959<br>01:16:51,520 –&gt; 01:16:59,520<br>I don’t want to talk very quickly because I answer three minutes left about about the other.</p>
<p>960<br>01:16:59,520 –&gt; 01:17:05,520<br>So the key thing I get to get at the paper is this actually this lock, conceptual view of the world.</p>
<p>961<br>01:17:05,520 –&gt; 01:17:11,520<br>Of course, you know, it didn’t practicalize and mentioned earlier. And so some direction has a proposal for how to do better.</p>
<p>962<br>01:17:11,520 –&gt; 01:17:22,520<br>Even though like other systems like Bitcoin actually do maintain the whole lot. And so what does the somebody do to things better instead of actually maintaining a log, you know, that’s actually a snapshots.</p>
<p>963<br>01:17:22,520 –&gt; 01:17:34,520<br>Similar to sort of the snapshots that we’ve seen before, you know, in raft, you know, where we construct a part of the world based on the log, you know, we take a snapshot and that actually forms the current state.</p>
<p>964<br>01:17:34,520 –&gt; 01:17:46,520<br>In fact, I’m really what the Sunder does. That actually doesn’t really make literally take snapshots to really maintains a snapshot view of the files and does it per user.</p>
<p>965<br>01:17:46,520 –&gt; 01:17:53,520<br>So one way to think about it is that the file system is sure started by user. Every user has its own view snapshots of the world.</p>
<p>966<br>01:17:53,520 –&gt; 01:18:00,520<br>And you know, there’s a little bit of a protocol to make sure that these different snapshots and different users are actually consistent.</p>
<p>967<br>01:18:00,520 –&gt; 01:18:10,520<br>And like a let me talk a little bit about how actually some there actually has makes that snapshot.</p>
<p>968<br>01:18:10,520 –&gt; 01:18:15,520<br>Basically in some there.</p>
<p>969<br>01:18:15,520 –&gt; 01:18:23,520<br>And some there basically there’s something that’s called the user eye handle. And the user eye handle basically uniquely identifies a snapshot in the file system.</p>
<p>970<br>01:18:23,520 –&gt; 01:18:39,520<br>And so basically it’s a cryptographic hash of the high table, which includes all the I notes in the system. And you know, and for every I know there’s a hash of the I note which basically covers all the data, all the blocks belong to that particular I note.</p>
<p>971<br>01:18:39,520 –&gt; 01:18:47,520<br>For example, when say a modifies off the UI in my right one block.</p>
<p>972<br>01:18:47,520 –&gt; 01:18:55,520<br>The client recomputes the hash of this block updates the entry here, you know, updates the entry here updates the entry here.</p>
<p>973<br>01:18:55,520 –&gt; 01:19:02,520<br>And that’s basically a new handle that describes basically that the capture actually on the complete in a file system.</p>
<p>974<br>01:19:02,520 –&gt; 01:19:17,520<br>And then you ignore the group in the directory of block for an item for a second. So this basically gives you a complete checkpoint or snapshot of user to view of the file system.</p>
<p>975<br>01:19:17,520 –&gt; 01:19:33,520<br>And then to deal with this issue of how to get some consistency across users. They have this notion of version factors.</p>
<p>976<br>01:19:33,520 –&gt; 01:19:43,520<br>One of version factors is pretty straightforward. Every version vector has an eye handle like a’s eye handle is in it after it modified.</p>
<p>977<br>01:19:43,520 –&gt; 01:19:54,520<br>See off the UI. And then for every user in the system, the version vector has a counter for the number of modifications that were made by that user.</p>
<p>978<br>01:19:54,520 –&gt; 01:20:09,520<br>So if a made this update to off the UI that counter set to one, you know, we didn’t make any modifications, you know, seeing didn’t make any modifications. They’re all zero and this whole thing is signed.</p>
<p>979<br>01:20:09,520 –&gt; 01:20:24,520<br>And so when B makes this modification. So I’ll use the version factor for B is this a’s version factor. So it’s first B makes a version. It creates a new handle that includes, of course, all the modifications represent all the medications.</p>
<p>980<br>01:20:24,520 –&gt; 01:20:44,520<br>And in its version handle that actually of a necessary factor, it includes which how many operations are read by a user. So it will record the fact that, for example, that it actually saw a spotification updates can abuse to be one can see to be zero and basically signs the this whole thing.</p>
<p>981<br>01:20:44,520 –&gt; 01:21:01,520<br>And now see when seeing extra dust operation once the read you know off the PY and fetched and banged up the Y basically downloads all the version factors from every user.</p>
<p>982<br>01:21:01,520 –&gt; 01:21:05,520<br>And in this case, we’ll get the first effect is for a and B.</p>
<p>983<br>01:21:05,520 –&gt; 01:21:19,520<br>Fixed the latest one, which in this case is B because actually it includes all the operations of a in it. And that’s basically the represented version of the file system from that version that reached off that UI.</p>
<p>984<br>01:21:19,520 –&gt; 01:21:24,520<br>And banked the Y.</p>
<p>985<br>01:21:24,520 –&gt; 01:21:42,520<br>And note, you know that basically it’s impossible for the server to basically present banged up the Y and not off the PY because you know it cannot, you know, it can only two sort of version factors can be returned is this version factor or this vector factor.</p>
<p>986<br>01:21:42,520 –&gt; 01:21:47,520<br>A doesn’t include actually the changes of bank B PY.</p>
<p>987<br>01:21:47,520 –&gt; 01:21:59,520<br>If you know see actually does get the versions of bank B to Y and must actually have the versions the modification that A is made because the version factors are constructing it that way.</p>
<p>988<br>01:21:59,520 –&gt; 01:22:11,520<br>And so that’s basically the way for using version factors to detect that S doesn’t drop changes as we as the same way that the logging system is done.</p>
<p>989<br>01:22:11,520 –&gt; 01:22:16,520<br>Okay, so that’s the essence of the version vector plan.</p>
<p>990<br>01:22:16,520 –&gt; 01:22:22,520<br>So in summary.</p>
<p>991<br>01:22:22,520 –&gt; 01:22:33,520<br>Okay, this and then participants, you know, I sort of a problem that you have to handle in decentralized systems.</p>
<p>992<br>01:22:33,520 –&gt; 01:22:40,520<br>Because there’s no single institution that sort of can be the sort of trust.</p>
<p>993<br>01:22:40,520 –&gt; 01:22:49,520<br>And we’ve seen this notion of sign logs is a very powerful tool to deal with malicious servers.</p>
<p>994<br>01:22:49,520 –&gt; 01:23:02,520<br>And as I said on Tuesday, we’re going to continue this discussion and you’ll see how the sort of design wags are used in Bitcoin and particular like how fork consistency or how.</p>
<p>995<br>01:23:02,520 –&gt; 01:23:08,520<br>The fact that for sure sort of being created or being resolved in the case of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>996<br>01:23:08,520 –&gt; 01:23:13,520<br>Okay, so that was it for as an introduction to sort of decentralized systems.</p>
<p>997<br>01:23:13,520 –&gt; 01:23:23,520<br>And I hope the paper is a little bit more understandable than maybe when before you start reading it earlier this week or today.</p>
<p>998<br>01:23:23,520 –&gt; 01:23:26,520<br>Okay, so you on Tuesday.</p>
<p>999<br>01:23:26,520 –&gt; 01:23:31,520<br>And of course, there’s questions, you know, peacefully, you feel free to hang around.</p>
<p>1000<br>01:23:31,520 –&gt; 01:23:36,520<br>If you need to go somewhere else, absolutely go somewhere else.</p>
<p>1001<br>01:23:36,520 –&gt; 01:23:42,520<br>I have a question about the data structure that they use the B plus tree or whatever.</p>
<p>1002<br>01:23:42,520 –&gt; 01:23:45,520<br>Like what’s the difference in that and like.</p>
<p>1003<br>01:23:45,520 –&gt; 01:23:50,520<br>Yeah, like like a Merkel dad, for example, it’s a Merkel data structure.</p>
<p>1004<br>01:23:50,520 –&gt; 01:23:55,520<br>You know, I think the person who is the sort of credit of his ideas, Merkel.</p>
<p>1005<br>01:23:55,520 –&gt; 01:24:00,520<br>And those wives often called the Merkel data tree.</p>
<p>1006<br>01:24:00,520 –&gt; 01:24:03,520<br>So this is the same thing.</p>
<p>1007<br>01:24:03,520 –&gt; 01:24:04,520<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1008<br>01:24:04,520 –&gt; 01:24:12,520<br>Okay. So in the basement uses a Merkel tree.</p>
<p>1009<br>01:24:12,520 –&gt; 01:24:21,520<br>So when you are verifying the signatures, doesn’t mean you have to like.</p>
<p>1010<br>01:24:21,520 –&gt; 01:24:28,520<br>Basically, as you go, if you’re 100 entries into the log, you have to compute.</p>
<p>1011<br>01:24:28,520 –&gt; 01:24:34,520<br>I don’t know the hash of only 100 entries concatenated and then compute.</p>
<p>1012<br>01:24:34,520 –&gt; 01:24:35,520<br>And.</p>
<p>1013<br>01:24:35,520 –&gt; 01:24:37,520<br>So you need to keep the running hash.</p>
<p>1014<br>01:24:37,520 –&gt; 01:24:41,520<br>Okay, let’s go back to verify.</p>
<p>1015<br>01:24:41,520 –&gt; 01:24:43,520<br>That’s.</p>
<p>1016<br>01:24:43,520 –&gt; 01:24:46,520<br>That’s to do.</p>
<p>1017<br>01:24:46,520 –&gt; 01:24:49,520<br>So here’s probably a good place to talk about it.</p>
<p>1018<br>01:24:49,520 –&gt; 01:24:51,520<br>So.</p>
<p>1019<br>01:24:51,520 –&gt; 01:24:53,520<br>So here.</p>
<p>1020<br>01:24:53,520 –&gt; 01:24:58,520<br>So let’s say, let’s take the last entry, correct.</p>
<p>1021<br>01:24:58,520 –&gt; 01:25:03,520<br>The last entry you will have a hash of the preceding entries.</p>
<p>1022<br>01:25:03,520 –&gt; 01:25:06,520<br>And so everything, you know, from the micro, whatever records.</p>
<p>1023<br>01:25:06,520 –&gt; 01:25:11,520<br>Let’s say this is zero one and two, you know, zero one and two.</p>
<p>1024<br>01:25:11,520 –&gt; 01:25:17,520<br>We’re basically has the hash of the previous entry number two.</p>
<p>1025<br>01:25:17,520 –&gt; 01:25:22,520<br>In it and that needs to be checked.</p>
<p>1026<br>01:25:22,520 –&gt; 01:25:25,520<br>And the way.</p>
<p>1027<br>01:25:25,520 –&gt; 01:25:30,520<br>Now this being checked is the, you know, in principle, if you start really from the beginning of the world,</p>
<p>1028<br>01:25:30,520 –&gt; 01:25:33,520<br>you would have to compute the hash of record zero.</p>
<p>1029<br>01:25:33,520 –&gt; 01:25:35,520<br>You find out what the hash is.</p>
<p>1030<br>01:25:35,520 –&gt; 01:25:38,520<br>And double check, you know, that.</p>
<p>1031<br>01:25:38,520 –&gt; 01:25:43,520<br>That corresponds to the entry that’s in here and that the signature is out.</p>
<p>1032<br>01:25:43,520 –&gt; 01:25:45,520<br>And so, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>1033<br>01:25:45,520 –&gt; 01:25:48,520<br>Now, of course, you know, in the real system, you can remember,</p>
<p>1034<br>01:25:48,520 –&gt; 01:25:49,520<br>motion of the log.</p>
<p>1035<br>01:25:49,520 –&gt; 01:25:56,520<br>And just double check that, like, whatever the, and start from there.</p>
<p>1036<br>01:25:56,520 –&gt; 01:25:58,520<br>Oh, it’s, it’s inefficient.</p>
<p>1037<br>01:25:58,520 –&gt; 01:26:01,520<br>So, you know, it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>1038<br>01:26:01,520 –&gt; 01:26:04,520<br>Yeah, you have to replay from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>1039<br>01:26:04,520 –&gt; 01:26:08,520<br>You’re basically an off, you know, really validate the whole lock from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>1040<br>01:26:08,520 –&gt; 01:26:09,520<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>1041<br>01:26:09,520 –&gt; 01:26:10,520<br>Emixence.</p>
<p>1042<br>01:26:10,520 –&gt; 01:26:12,520<br>Yeah, you’ll see this in the Bitcoin paper.</p>
<p>1043<br>01:26:12,520 –&gt; 01:26:16,520<br>So are the hash is like almost like a Merkel chain.</p>
<p>1044<br>01:26:16,520 –&gt; 01:26:17,520<br>Like this.</p>
<p>1045<br>01:26:17,520 –&gt; 01:26:18,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1046<br>01:26:18,520 –&gt; 01:26:19,520<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1047<br>01:26:19,520 –&gt; 01:26:20,520<br>Same idea.</p>
<p>1048<br>01:26:20,520 –&gt; 01:26:23,520<br>So are the,</p>
<p>1049<br>01:26:23,520 –&gt; 01:26:32,520<br>like, if, or is this like leaf in the sort of tree or chain, like an entire file or like blocks of a file.</p>
<p>1050<br>01:26:32,520 –&gt; 01:26:34,520<br>This is a block, one block.</p>
<p>1051<br>01:26:34,520 –&gt; 01:26:43,520<br>So this is four five from 96 bytes.</p>
<p>1052<br>01:26:43,520 –&gt; 01:26:45,520<br>And all the other has to don’t change.</p>
<p>1053<br>01:26:45,520 –&gt; 01:26:48,520<br>So it’s actually not that efficient in the fiction.</p>
<p>1054<br>01:26:48,520 –&gt; 01:26:51,520<br>Yeah, because if you only change part of the file, it only rehashes that part.</p>
<p>1055<br>01:26:51,520 –&gt; 01:26:56,520<br>You just have to rehash that one. And then you have to re re re compute to hash up the tree.</p>
<p>1056<br>01:26:56,520 –&gt; 01:27:02,520<br>All the way to the users eye handle.</p>
<p>1057<br>01:27:02,520 –&gt; 01:27:06,520<br>And the paper talks about the sort of a couple of optimization to make this more efficient.</p>
<p>1058<br>01:27:06,520 –&gt; 01:27:18,520<br>What hashing is up in generally not that expensive. The signing is the more expensive part operation.</p>
<p>1059<br>01:27:18,520 –&gt; 01:27:20,520<br>I had a question about version vectors.</p>
<p>1060<br>01:27:20,520 –&gt; 01:27:21,520<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1061<br>01:27:21,520 –&gt; 01:27:25,520<br>So we use version vectors to make sure that the system can’t return like an old state.</p>
<p>1062<br>01:27:25,520 –&gt; 01:27:26,520<br>Yes.</p>
<p>1063<br>01:27:26,520 –&gt; 01:27:31,520<br>Why can’t the, why can’t the system just return the old state and the old version vector if it keeps like a second copy.</p>
<p>1064<br>01:27:31,520 –&gt; 01:27:33,520<br>Yeah, it’s good for.</p>
<p>1065<br>01:27:33,520 –&gt; 01:27:34,520<br>Right.</p>
<p>1066<br>01:27:34,520 –&gt; 01:27:37,520<br>So so we, so we only have four consistency then with the, yeah.</p>
<p>1067<br>01:27:37,520 –&gt; 01:27:39,520<br>I have a version of vectors only for consistency.</p>
<p>1068<br>01:27:39,520 –&gt; 01:27:40,520<br>Some there for consistency.</p>
<p>1069<br>01:27:40,520 –&gt; 01:27:41,520<br>No more.</p>
<p>1070<br>01:27:41,520 –&gt; 01:27:47,520<br>Got it.</p>
<p>1071<br>01:27:47,520 –&gt; 01:27:50,520<br>So the consistency you need the time stamp.</p>
<p>1072<br>01:27:50,520 –&gt; 01:28:00,520<br>Before consistency. I mean, you know, the, uh, the server can fork the log at any particular point of time.</p>
<p>1073<br>01:28:00,520 –&gt; 01:28:09,520<br>I mean, present the consistent view of the one big can merge logs back together.</p>
<p>1074<br>01:28:09,520 –&gt; 01:28:16,520<br>Really this picture that the server can actually construct into different views of the world and split.</p>
<p>1075<br>01:28:16,520 –&gt; 01:28:18,520<br>You know, the world in multiple worlds.</p>
<p>1076<br>01:28:18,520 –&gt; 01:28:22,520<br>Uh, but it can merge the worlds back together.</p>
<p>1077<br>01:28:22,520 –&gt; 01:28:24,520<br>Undetected.</p>
<p>1078<br>01:28:24,520 –&gt; 01:28:28,520<br>So.</p>
<p>1079<br>01:28:28,520 –&gt; 01:28:34,520<br>The best we can do is fork consistency, which allows for forking, but we can detect forking.</p>
<p>1080<br>01:28:34,520 –&gt; 01:28:35,520<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>1081<br>01:28:35,520 –&gt; 01:28:37,520<br>So if we detect forking.</p>
<p>1082<br>01:28:37,520 –&gt; 01:28:40,520<br>Can we then get something stronger than for consistency?</p>
<p>1083<br>01:28:40,520 –&gt; 01:28:41,520<br>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>1084<br>01:28:41,520 –&gt; 01:28:43,520<br>Well, we can settle on a fork.</p>
<p>1085<br>01:28:43,520 –&gt; 01:28:45,520<br>We’re going to have forks.</p>
<p>1086<br>01:28:45,520 –&gt; 01:28:49,520<br>We can try to settle like pick one fork as the one to go for it with.</p>
<p>1087<br>01:28:49,520 –&gt; 01:28:51,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1088<br>01:28:51,520 –&gt; 01:28:54,520<br>But thunder doesn’t have a way to do that.</p>
<p>1089<br>01:28:54,520 –&gt; 01:28:55,520<br>Nope.</p>
<p>1090<br>01:28:55,520 –&gt; 01:28:57,520<br>Okay.</p>
<p>1091<br>01:28:57,520 –&gt; 01:29:00,520<br>So under this.</p>
<p>1092<br>01:29:00,520 –&gt; 01:29:03,520<br>I mean, some, some, some, some methods.</p>
<p>1093<br>01:29:03,520 –&gt; 01:29:04,520<br>No.</p>
<p>1094<br>01:29:04,520 –&gt; 01:29:12,520<br>Methods to detect and basically you get a one, basically, proposions like you use the time stamp box to use that one.</p>
<p>1095<br>01:29:12,520 –&gt; 01:29:18,520<br>So.</p>
<p>1096<br>01:29:18,520 –&gt; 01:29:20,520<br>Thanks.</p>
<p>1097<br>01:29:20,520 –&gt; 01:29:22,520<br>You’re welcome.</p>
<p>1098<br>01:29:22,520 –&gt; 01:29:26,520<br>The time some, the time stamp box is just a server that depends entries and.</p>
<p>1099<br>01:29:26,520 –&gt; 01:29:28,520<br>Yeah, and it’s trusted.</p>
<p>1100<br>01:29:28,520 –&gt; 01:29:35,520<br>So it’s not under control of the adversary.</p>
<p>1101<br>01:29:35,520 –&gt; 01:29:38,520<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>1102<br>01:29:38,520 –&gt; 01:29:44,520<br>So, can I also ask one final question about the devian example you said in the beginning.</p>
<p>1103<br>01:29:44,520 –&gt; 01:29:47,520<br>Can you say again, what happened there?</p>
<p>1104<br>01:29:47,520 –&gt; 01:29:49,520<br>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>1105<br>01:29:49,520 –&gt; 01:29:58,520<br>So basically the, this is the source repo or the development machines for devian Linux in 2003.</p>
<p>1106<br>01:29:58,520 –&gt; 01:30:05,520<br>Attack of compromised broke into those machines and modified files.</p>
<p>1107<br>01:30:05,520 –&gt; 01:30:12,520<br>And this is the distribution that has been sort of handed off, you know, which, you know, if you run devian Linux, you’re, you’re.</p>
<p>1108<br>01:30:12,520 –&gt; 01:30:18,520<br>Anybody who got it like the devian limbs after you tacked and I got maybe a compromised devian Linux.</p>
<p>1109<br>01:30:18,520 –&gt; 01:30:23,520<br>And so when they soon as they discovered this, they didn’t do any further development.</p>
<p>1110<br>01:30:23,520 –&gt; 01:30:31,520<br>And they were further distributions, they sorted out like, you know, went to backups and I started comparing files from backups with the files that they have.</p>
<p>1111<br>01:30:31,520 –&gt; 01:30:38,520<br>And you know, basically double check that all the changes that were in the repo are actually reading a legit.</p>
<p>1112<br>01:30:38,520 –&gt; 01:30:43,520<br>Okay, roll back and roll back any changes are not legit.</p>
<p>1113<br>01:30:43,520 –&gt; 01:30:45,520<br>That is a freeback.</p>
<p>1114<br>01:30:45,520 –&gt; 01:30:46,520<br>Yeah, it’s pretty bad.</p>
<p>1115<br>01:30:46,520 –&gt; 01:30:50,520<br>Just occasionally happens. This is a real problem.</p>
<p>1116<br>01:30:50,520 –&gt; 01:30:52,520<br>That’s a real problem in practice.</p>
<p>1117<br>01:30:52,520 –&gt; 01:30:56,520<br>Thank you so much. That was a very interesting lecture. Thank you.</p>
<p>1118<br>01:30:56,520 –&gt; 01:30:58,520<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>1119<br>01:31:01,520 –&gt; 01:31:03,520<br>Thank you.</p>
