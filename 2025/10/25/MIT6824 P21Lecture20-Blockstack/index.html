                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,759<br>Okay, thank you. Okay, so that’s good afternoon. Good morning. Good evening. Good night,</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,759 –&gt; 00:00:11,839<br>wherever you are. And I guess I was welcome to the last week of the semester. So there’s two more</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,839 –&gt; 00:00:17,120<br>class meetings today, which we’re going to be talking about block stack. And on first day,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,920 –&gt; 00:00:24,320<br>while we get a report from the different projects from the number of the project groups in 6, 8,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:24,320 –&gt; 00:00:34,399<br>2, 4. So today is basically the last paper discussion day. And so the topic is, you know,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:34,399 –&gt; 00:00:40,400<br>the system that we assigned for when I assigned for reading was block stack. And really,</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:40,399 –&gt; 00:00:46,000<br>what block stack represents is an approach to building decentralized</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:49,280 –&gt; 00:00:58,879<br>applications. And we’ve decentralized what we mean here is that unlike in centralized websites,</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:58,879 –&gt; 00:01:04,719<br>you know, the sort of website, owns the data in decentralized application, the system is set up</p>
<p>10<br>00:01:04,719 –&gt; 00:01:09,039<br>in a way that the users actually keep control over the data and not the websites.</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:09,840 –&gt; 00:01:13,920<br>And so this form sort of a trend in the last, you know, is sort of the final lecture in this</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:13,920 –&gt; 00:01:18,560<br>sort of series of three lectures on decentralized distributed systems. You know, we talked about</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:19,920 –&gt; 00:01:25,439<br>logs and signing or sign logs as a way of constructing these decentralized storage systems.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:26,160 –&gt; 00:01:33,280<br>We saw Bitcoin to see as an example of how you can achieve consensus in a decentralized system</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:33,280 –&gt; 00:01:38,640<br>with entrusted participants or business and participants. And so today we’re sort of taking one</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:38,640 –&gt; 00:01:42,960<br>more step off and actually look at like how you can actually build, you know, complete applications</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:42,960 –&gt; 00:01:48,879<br>other than just crypto currency applications. And decentralized applications have a long history</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:49,840 –&gt; 00:01:56,319<br>in the early 2000s and late 90s. There was a lot of to do around peer-to-peer applications,</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:57,599 –&gt; 00:02:02,719<br>which had a decentralized architecture like Napster, you know, more reasonably,</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:03,519 –&gt; 00:02:09,759<br>you know, you’re probably familiar with Keybase, which has a decentralized design or a solid,</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:11,759 –&gt; 00:02:17,680<br>and of course, BoxStank. And so there’s a, no, quite a bit of activity in this space of decentralized</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:17,680 –&gt; 00:02:24,319<br>applications. The blocks that is interesting from the perspective of actually running decentralized</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:24,319 –&gt; 00:02:30,319<br>applications, but also is an example of sort of a non-currency use, non-money use,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:32,719 –&gt; 00:02:48,960<br>of Bitcoin, of the blockchain. And we’ll see, you know, there are a number of aspects that</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:48,960 –&gt; 00:02:54,159<br>are interesting in the block stack, but the key thing that the sort of paper focuses on is actually</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:54,159 –&gt; 00:03:01,120<br>naming how to sort of build and distribute a decentralized naming system. And of course,</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:01,120 –&gt; 00:03:07,280<br>our naming systems are widely used, you know, if you think of DNS, I think of a, you know,</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:07,280 –&gt; 00:03:11,520<br>Peruvian roast, you know, there’s tons and tons of different naming systems out there,</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:11,520 –&gt; 00:03:15,439<br>you know, why we use, and this is just a different design than where the most interesting part of it</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:15,439 –&gt; 00:03:25,840<br>again is it’s decentralized. Now this lecture is a little bit different than sort of the</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:25,840 –&gt; 00:03:29,120<br>preceding lectures or many of the preceding lectures, many of the preceding lectures sort of have</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:29,120 –&gt; 00:03:33,120<br>to play here, well, here’s a hard technical problem, here’s the solution to solve that particular</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:33,120 –&gt; 00:03:39,360<br>problem. And here we’re in a slightly sort of different position, there’s a hard technical problem</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:39,360 –&gt; 00:03:44,640<br>and we have to build decentralized applications, but it’s not, you know, 100% clear that there’s</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:44,640 –&gt; 00:03:48,080<br>exactly, you know, the right thing to do to build decentralized applications, when there’s extremely</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:48,080 –&gt; 00:03:54,640<br>intriguing. And it’s not clear that like block stack is just the right solution to do so. And so</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:54,639 –&gt; 00:03:59,919<br>it’s much more experimental, you know, walkstrike does actually have a user community, and</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:00,639 –&gt; 00:04:05,679<br>but, you know, it’s not like yet an overwhelming success and a demonstration that this is the</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:05,679 –&gt; 00:04:13,839<br>right way to go. So in that sense, this is, this paper in some sense is more fought-provoking</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:13,839 –&gt; 00:04:18,560<br>than giving actually a definite answer to a particular technical problem. And so,</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:19,439 –&gt; 00:04:26,720<br>in some ways, you know, this is a lower topic that sort of lends self to a larger debate about,</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:26,720 –&gt; 00:04:32,639<br>you know, the different views on this kind of kind of design. And so, when we’re doing lecture,</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:32,639 –&gt; 00:04:38,000<br>if we get to, it would be perfectly fine actually, you know, to have quite a bit of discussion</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:38,800 –&gt; 00:04:41,519<br>on different aspects. And I don’t think there’s going to be one right answer.</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:42,159 –&gt; 00:04:48,959<br>And so, anytime you have a question about, or one is, are you about a particular aspect of</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:48,959 –&gt; 00:04:58,799<br>sort of these decentralized app designs, you know, in the speak-up? Okay. So maybe before, you know,</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:58,799 –&gt; 00:05:02,399<br>talking about decentralized apps, you know, this is a quick revisit, you know, actually, what’s</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:02,399 –&gt; 00:05:06,319<br>sort of the common paradigm to actually build websites, or build web applications, right? And that’s</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:06,959 –&gt; 00:05:15,439<br>really using centralized websites. The sites in my itself might be distributed across multiple</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:15,439 –&gt; 00:05:20,079<br>data centers across the world, but the architecture of the design of the site is, you know, centralized,</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:20,079 –&gt; 00:05:25,759<br>you know, where we have, you know, here’s your, your typical website. It has, you know, some</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:25,759 –&gt; 00:05:31,360<br>applications from code, you know, whatever, Gmail, you know, whatever Twitter or Facebook,</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:32,240 –&gt; 00:05:39,040<br>and that operates on a database that contains, you know, user data.</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:42,879 –&gt; 00:05:46,560<br>And we might actually have different users interacting, you know, with the</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:47,680 –&gt; 00:05:54,639<br>sitting by the web browser, and user one, user two, they interact through the application</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:54,639 –&gt; 00:05:58,560<br>with the website, you know, they create data, the data stored in the database,</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:59,280 –&gt; 00:06:04,160<br>the user may view the data, and the application displays basically, you know, that data to,</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:04,879 –&gt; 00:06:09,680<br>you know, inside of the web browser. Maybe, you know, the data might be, you know, block posts,</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:11,680 –&gt; 00:06:12,160<br>tweets,</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:16,560 –&gt; 00:06:24,879<br>piazza posts, photos, perhaps even more sort of sensitive, you know, medical records, medical records,</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:25,040 –&gt; 00:06:32,639<br>et cetera. And basically, you know, the application we’re running on the site, you know, to</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:32,639 –&gt; 00:06:37,519<br>transform, you know, that data from all the different users into something that seems to look</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:37,519 –&gt; 00:06:41,920<br>at the way I wear, and basically integrating, for example, the timeline of, you know, many users</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:41,920 –&gt; 00:06:47,040<br>into a single timeline presented to the user, you know, organizing the tweets, you know, doing</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:47,120 –&gt; 00:06:55,280<br>ups and downs, et cetera, et cetera. And, you know, one sort of distinction feature of this sort</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:55,280 –&gt; 00:06:59,840<br>of design is that the application and the data are bundled, you know, they’re only the control</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:59,840 –&gt; 00:07:04,000<br>of the application site, you know, whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, you know, Google or any,</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:04,000 –&gt; 00:07:08,240<br>you know, website, and really the interface between the user or sort of the dividing line between</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:08,240 –&gt; 00:07:19,120<br>the user, and the website is basically, you know, HTML or UI. The application basically computes,</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:19,120 –&gt; 00:07:23,439<br>you know, whatever the user is going to see, and that’s going to be displayed inside of the browser.</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:23,439 –&gt; 00:07:27,120<br>Of course, the application might actually run inside of the browser, not like, you know,</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:27,120 –&gt; 00:07:32,000<br>JavaScript, but as a result, it’s not really proven into this particular discussion, you know,</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:32,000 –&gt; 00:07:36,079<br>it’s still the application, the solution to control of the website, you know, the programmers</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:36,079 –&gt; 00:07:40,079<br>with the website, right, the application, and the application basically, you know, manipulates</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:40,079 –&gt; 00:07:44,560<br>the DOM, you know, fields from inside of the web browser. And so from the user point of view,</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:45,199 –&gt; 00:07:50,399<br>the interaction, the interface, you know, between the dividing interface between the website,</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:50,399 –&gt; 00:08:00,079<br>and the browser is still sort of HTML. And so this, you know, this design clearly is</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:00,079 –&gt; 00:08:06,399<br>overwhelmingly successful. You know, most websites, you probably, actually, probably all of the websites</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:06,399 –&gt; 00:08:12,959<br>you probably use are, you know, following this particular design. And then one reason for,</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:12,959 –&gt; 00:08:16,399<br>you know, this very successful design, as we’ll talk a little bit more later is, you know, because of</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:16,399 –&gt; 00:08:20,959<br>the tight integration between the application and the data from the different users. So the application</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:20,959 –&gt; 00:08:26,079<br>is easy access to all users’ data from different users, and then greater than the creative and</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:26,079 –&gt; 00:08:33,519<br>interesting ways. But there are, you know, it’s not completely perfect, you know, this design. And</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:33,519 –&gt; 00:08:38,559<br>so there’s sort of things that, you know, you might wish could be slightly better. And then</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:38,559 –&gt; 00:08:43,759<br>sometimes decentralized applications is a response to those sort of things that are, and it might</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:43,759 –&gt; 00:08:51,120<br>be not 100% desirable. So for one, there’s a very simple oxidation. You can really not create another</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:51,120 –&gt; 00:08:56,720<br>application. So the site decides actually how the app looks like, you know, that’s the UI you’re</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:56,720 –&gt; 00:09:04,720<br>going to get. And which is sort of very different than, let’s say, you’re running application</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:04,720 –&gt; 00:09:09,600<br>doing your laptop, for example, you want to modify and edit a text file, but you get to choose which</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:09,600 –&gt; 00:09:14,320<br>browser or editor you’re going to use. You know, you can use e-max, you know, then, you know, you can have</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:14,320 –&gt; 00:09:18,480<br>a whole kinds of culture wars about which one is better than the other, but you get an option, you</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:18,639 –&gt; 00:09:23,279<br>choose which one you want to use. And in this case, you know, that’s just not the case. You’re using</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:23,279 –&gt; 00:09:28,480<br>Gmail, you know, where Gmail is not the best example. The Twitter, you know, Twitter is going to decide</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:28,480 –&gt; 00:09:33,120<br>actually how the application is going to look like. The reason why Gmail might not be the best example</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:33,120 –&gt; 00:09:37,200<br>is because you can actually download your email, maybe, you know, through IMAP and then run your own</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:38,159 –&gt; 00:09:43,039<br>email program. But for many of that, you know, the user and the application data very controlled,</p>
<p>97<br>00:09:43,039 –&gt; 00:09:50,159<br>and you have no control over it. The website, you know, may change the rules on who can see</p>
<p>98<br>00:09:50,159 –&gt; 00:09:55,599<br>and what data. And you know, my ad actually do it without really telling you. And so you don’t</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:55,599 –&gt; 00:10:00,559<br>have to have full control over actually who sees your data. Furthermore, you know, the website</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:00,559 –&gt; 00:10:05,599<br>actually might use your data to, you know, generate revenue, you know, whatever to site, which ads</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:05,599 –&gt; 00:10:12,639<br>actually to display. And you know, basically swooping over your data, right? More in the worst case,</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:12,639 –&gt; 00:10:18,159<br>you know, maybe that I believe actually just shoots over your data. And that’s really sort of</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:18,159 –&gt; 00:10:21,519<br>outside of your control. There’s nothing we really can do about it. You’re going to get the website</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:21,519 –&gt; 00:10:30,879<br>the data that’s there now. And so this is sort of the sort of pinpoint, you know, it makes people</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:30,879 –&gt; 00:10:37,360<br>wondering, you know, is there a way of designing systems that really not don’t follow this, you know,</p>
<p>106<br>00:10:37,360 –&gt; 00:10:40,560<br>paradigm, but you know, follow this paradigm of decentralized applications.</p>
<p>107<br>00:10:55,919 –&gt; 00:11:01,920<br>And so in this world view, you know, as everybody ever still have our internet, the cloud,</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:02,879 –&gt; 00:11:09,439<br>but we have storage providers. And your storage providers are basically nothing really,</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:11,120 –&gt; 00:11:16,719<br>you know, sophisticated where you know, really wrong app code, they just purely provide storage,</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:16,719 –&gt; 00:11:24,159<br>you know, ways of maybe it’s like Google Drive or whatever or Amazon S3, but basically they’re sort of</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:24,159 –&gt; 00:11:31,360<br>dumb, you know, bit holders. The data may be, you know, and usually probably wants to encrypt the data,</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:31,360 –&gt; 00:11:35,680<br>but basically what the real goal here is that the user decides, you know, which storage for</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:35,680 –&gt; 00:11:40,240<br>where the data lives and it keeps them into control of the user. So it made a very, you know,</p>
<p>114<br>00:11:40,240 –&gt; 00:11:48,480<br>storage writer. S3 might have, you know, users one data. Now that storage provider might actually</p>
<p>115<br>00:11:48,480 –&gt; 00:11:54,960<br>have user to use data, or stores, you know, data on behalf of user to use to use users. S3 may actually</p>
<p>116<br>00:11:54,960 –&gt; 00:11:57,759<br>encrypt it, you know, so that the storage provider can actually not read it.</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:58,159 –&gt; 00:12:07,360<br>And control like who can actually decrypt the data. And then the applications really are in the</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:07,360 –&gt; 00:12:15,120<br>control of the user themselves. And so, you know, my user, user here, you want workstation or laptop,</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:15,120 –&gt; 00:12:23,919<br>you know, runs in the application. And, you know, there’s you two, there’s also another application</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:23,919 –&gt; 00:12:27,599<br>may actually you’re looking at me did the same data, but like a slightly different version of the</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:27,599 –&gt; 00:12:34,479<br>application, whatever one photo viewer and another photo viewer. And basically to construct, you know,</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:34,479 –&gt; 00:12:39,839<br>the sort of what is actually shown to the user, you know, the application will fetch, you know, data,</p>
<p>123<br>00:12:39,839 –&gt; 00:12:47,279<br>you know, from different usage, for example, if you do share the photos with you one, then, you know,</p>
<p>124<br>00:12:47,279 –&gt; 00:12:54,240<br>the applications sort of integrate the photos you want into to by extracting or retrieving the</p>
<p>125<br>00:12:55,279 –&gt; 00:13:00,639<br>the photos from the different storage providers. And here really about the sort of dividing</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:00,639 –&gt; 00:13:10,879<br>line is between users and the dividing line is is really this, there’s sort of a dividing line</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:10,879 –&gt; 00:13:16,639<br>between the application and the store, so there’s a storage API. Perhaps this sort of</p>
<p>128<br>00:13:16,960 –&gt; 00:13:21,279<br>uniform because many different applications are going to use the same storage I divide and</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:21,279 –&gt; 00:13:27,759<br>maybe use application, you know, creates to do lists, maybe it’s a photo list, maybe it’s a Twitter</p>
<p>130<br>00:13:27,759 –&gt; 00:13:32,559<br>clone that is retrieved the tweets from different users and integrate them and presents them to the</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:32,559 –&gt; 00:13:39,120<br>user. And, and it’s really that sort of single storage API or that’s the, that’s the, that’s the,</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:40,080 –&gt; 00:13:45,759<br>that actually provide, you know, the dividing line between the applications and the data.</p>
<p>133<br>00:13:46,639 –&gt; 00:13:50,319<br>Of course, that source API has to be quite general purpose can support multiple applications,</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:50,319 –&gt; 00:13:54,720<br>but also has to allow sharing between different application, between different user and different</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:54,720 –&gt; 00:14:03,039<br>applications, the modular or the permissions. And so, you know, let’s say you wanted to build</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:04,399 –&gt; 00:14:06,159<br>sort of a sure yard to do list,</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:06,639 –&gt; 00:14:18,399<br>then, you know, between user one and user two, then let’s look at this from the perspective of</p>
<p>138<br>00:14:18,399 –&gt; 00:14:23,600<br>user one, you know, probably there would be some operation, some sharing operating to use</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:23,600 –&gt; 00:14:28,159<br>a two and user one saying like, yeah, you know, here’s the names of the might to do list.</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:29,120 –&gt; 00:14:36,480<br>And, you know, user one can then download, you know, the user to do list, maybe check, you know,</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:36,480 –&gt; 00:14:42,559<br>the signature on the file to do is to verify that data was indeed written by user two. And then,</p>
<p>142<br>00:14:42,559 –&gt; 00:14:48,559<br>you know, integrate, you know, that we have its own to do list and, you know, present to user one,</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:49,279 –&gt; 00:14:53,439<br>a shared to do list that contains both user ones and user two’s to do items.</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:53,440 –&gt; 00:15:01,040<br>So, that was sort of the general view of accidentally building these,</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:02,400 –&gt; 00:15:14,880<br>these decentralized architecture for applications. Any questions so far?</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:15,360 –&gt; 00:15:26,480<br>Okay, so, so, so far we’re hopefully received, you know, the address is one of the sort of the</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:26,480 –&gt; 00:15:31,919<br>major, you know, pingpoints for the centralized approach that basically the users know,</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:31,919 –&gt; 00:15:37,439<br>stay in control of the data. It’s not owned by a particular site anymore and the users decide</p>
<p>149<br>00:15:37,439 –&gt; 00:15:43,919<br>who, well, which applications and who actually can access the data. I know that’s a desirable</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:45,200 –&gt; 00:15:51,039<br>property. But, you know, the, the, the, the whole design is also with its, you know, set of challenges.</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:51,039 –&gt; 00:15:55,759<br>And so, let me lay out some of them and we’ll focus in a few of them in the context of block stack.</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:01,039 –&gt; 00:16:06,639<br>And so, there’s sort of two, I think, broad categories of challenges. One sort of on the business site,</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:07,200 –&gt; 00:16:14,240<br>you know, what is the revenue model? You know, what will, you know, get these applications</p>
<p>154<br>00:16:14,240 –&gt; 00:16:18,320<br>actually being adopted and, you know, paid people money to actually develop the applications.</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:19,759 –&gt; 00:16:26,720<br>And sort of that actually become really good. And, and, and, and, people are excited by using that.</p>
<p>156<br>00:16:27,680 –&gt; 00:16:32,560<br>Well, not really going to, you know, kind of talk about that at all. But in a step, you know,</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:32,560 –&gt; 00:16:34,399<br>one emotion focus on the technical challenges.</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:35,360 –&gt; 00:16:37,360<br>And so, there’s a lot of challenges.</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:43,360 –&gt; 00:16:50,480<br>And the, the several of them. One is, you know, so we go back to this picture he before,</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:51,360 –&gt; 00:16:57,039<br>you know, the storage API sort of the, you know, key interface. And, you know, the interface has to</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:57,039 –&gt; 00:17:03,199<br>be minimal and has to be general purpose enough. But, and typically, it’s actually, you know, it’s not</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:03,200 –&gt; 00:17:10,240<br>the same thing as the API that is sits here. You know, the application and the database.</p>
<p>163<br>00:17:11,920 –&gt; 00:17:13,920<br>Let’s do that. We’ll have a second.</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:33,200 –&gt; 00:17:35,200<br>Okay.</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:41,200 –&gt; 00:17:44,640<br>Okay. Hopefully everybody has seen screened the watch again. Good.</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:48,080 –&gt; 00:17:53,360<br>So, there’s a couple of other technical challenges. You know, and what I was going to point out is that that storage API</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:54,080 –&gt; 00:18:00,000<br>is typically not as powerful where that file system API is not as powerful as SQL.</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:00,000 –&gt; 00:18:10,240<br>Yeah. And, and for the more, you know, not all the data sort of old uses is like handy in a single place that you can run</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:10,240 –&gt; 00:18:14,960<br>your arbitrary careers on to integrate it in, you know, whatever application specific managed.</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:16,079 –&gt; 00:18:22,960<br>So, that’s sort of a challenge that’s of application really rely on the power of being able to run arbitrary</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:22,960 –&gt; 00:18:28,480<br>queries over all the user data that is in a decentralized application, a little bit hard to achieve because the data is spread out</p>
<p>172<br>00:18:28,720 –&gt; 00:18:30,720<br>over maybe, maybe, different storage servers.</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:32,079 –&gt; 00:18:37,440<br>There’s also features that might be hard to implement. Like, for example, if you want to implement</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:37,440 –&gt; 00:18:47,519<br>eBay, then users have to submit sort of bits, but, you know, we want to dumb disclose those bits immediately.</p>
<p>175<br>00:18:48,079 –&gt; 00:18:54,480<br>So, there have to be some trusted, you know, aspect to that actually integrates these bits and then decides, you know, actually who’s the winner</p>
<p>176<br>00:18:55,200 –&gt; 00:18:57,360<br>without, you know, disclosing those bits beforehand.</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:59,120 –&gt; 00:19:07,120<br>Similarly, there’s a challenge, there’s a random management, typically, you know, these decentralized applications, you know,</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:07,120 –&gt; 00:19:09,120<br>involve, you know, crypto keys.</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:11,279 –&gt; 00:19:21,519<br>And so, there has to be sort of, you know, that’s often an Achilles heel, right? And some users lose their private key and then, you know, you can’t use your, you can’t get to your data anymore.</p>
<p>180<br>00:19:22,480 –&gt; 00:19:27,039<br>And, or somebody actually steals your private key and then, you know, they can get your data.</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:28,000 –&gt; 00:19:33,599<br>So, there’s a sort of a series of technical challenge, you know, to make this actually work.</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:34,240 –&gt; 00:19:39,039<br>And one of them, the one remaining one in which it was mostly the topic of this lecture is naming.</p>
<p>183<br>00:19:43,759 –&gt; 00:19:50,399<br>And so, these broad set of challenges are basically, I think, you know, challenge for any sort of decentralized application infrastructure.</p>
<p>184<br>00:19:50,399 –&gt; 00:19:53,759<br>And certainly also in the context of a block stack.</p>
<p>185<br>00:19:54,400 –&gt; 00:20:02,079<br>But in a case of block stack, you know, we’re going to mostly, you know, we’ll see actually the importance of names and why naming actually is a challenge.</p>
<p>186<br>00:20:03,359 –&gt; 00:20:06,720<br>Okay, so before continuing, I want to stop here for a second.</p>
<p>187<br>00:20:06,720 –&gt; 00:20:17,039<br>They sort of people time to ask any questions, you know, to contrasting sort of these two different ways of building applications, whether it’s, you know, centralized as in the sort of traditional model,</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:17,039 –&gt; 00:20:20,799<br>but we’re probably all familiar with, you know, or just decentralized model.</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:22,960 –&gt; 00:20:25,200<br>So, what’s the challenge exactly with BIDS?</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:26,639 –&gt; 00:20:27,440<br>So, which challenge?</p>
<p>191<br>00:20:28,240 –&gt; 00:20:28,960<br>With BIDS?</p>
<p>192<br>00:20:30,240 –&gt; 00:20:39,599<br>Oh, you know, you need an application needs to have access to the user bits, but shouldn’t disclose them, right, to other applications.</p>
<p>193<br>00:20:39,599 –&gt; 00:20:46,639<br>And so, that means that the application, like, like, I’m you one, I’m submitting a bit.</p>
<p>194<br>00:20:47,680 –&gt; 00:20:53,200<br>You know, get a few two’s bit, but my applications didn’t really disclose you two’s bit, meaning to me, because it wouldn’t be fair.</p>
<p>195<br>00:20:54,480 –&gt; 00:21:00,319<br>And so, how would you do that? So, you need some sort of form form of a trusted party or whatever, some protocol that actually makes that happen.</p>
<p>196<br>00:21:03,759 –&gt; 00:21:04,159<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>197<br>00:21:06,079 –&gt; 00:21:10,879<br>Please, you know, the application runs on your work, so you can modify the work and the application, right.</p>
<p>198<br>00:21:11,440 –&gt; 00:21:16,880<br>Sorry, in the previous slide, I think you mentioned also,</p>
<p>199<br>00:21:18,640 –&gt; 00:21:22,400<br>app 1 being different from like the two apps being different.</p>
<p>200<br>00:21:24,160 –&gt; 00:21:25,920<br>What do you mean exactly?</p>
<p>201<br>00:21:25,920 –&gt; 00:21:29,520<br>Well, look, okay, we just do maintain allergies very crisp, this could be them.</p>
<p>202<br>00:21:30,560 –&gt; 00:21:37,520<br>This could be E-Mex, and you want and you too, get the decide which application they’re going to use to actually modify their, you know, data, right.</p>
<p>203<br>00:21:38,480 –&gt; 00:21:49,599<br>And today, in sort of centralized model, and others not really possible, you know, you can’t have basically two Twitter apps, you know, where you were like one way of interacting with the Twitter app, because somebody else likes to do it in a different way.</p>
<p>204<br>00:21:51,039 –&gt; 00:21:52,240<br>Let’s just do a Twitter app.</p>
<p>205<br>00:21:53,279 –&gt; 00:21:54,240<br>I see. Thank you.</p>
<p>206<br>00:21:56,000 –&gt; 00:22:00,799<br>I had a question just about like the design of the decentralized app, like model.</p>
<p>207<br>00:22:00,879 –&gt; 00:22:11,119<br>Is it necessary for the app to be like on the client side, or could it, you know, could you have like these like the centralized apps on the like internet side.</p>
<p>208<br>00:22:11,119 –&gt; 00:22:16,799<br>Yeah, you could have a principle in it, and it’s like the key issue, and it doesn’t really have to run on the user’s workstation,</p>
<p>209<br>00:22:16,799 –&gt; 00:22:20,000<br>and if there’s going to run anywhere, but it is under the user’s control.</p>
<p>210<br>00:22:21,200 –&gt; 00:22:25,919<br>Of course, you have somebody who writes it, but the user gets to decide which app to run over what data.</p>
<p>211<br>00:22:26,880 –&gt; 00:22:27,600<br>Right.</p>
<p>212<br>00:22:27,600 –&gt; 00:22:38,000<br>So the important thing to hear is said, you know, app that you should choose as the app, and like, importantly, the app has access to any storage provider, right.</p>
<p>213<br>00:22:38,000 –&gt; 00:22:38,480<br>Yep.</p>
<p>214<br>00:22:46,400 –&gt; 00:22:47,360<br>Okay. Any other questions?</p>
<p>215<br>00:22:47,439 –&gt; 00:22:57,439<br>Okay. So names. So, and this is getting a little bit more into block stack.</p>
<p>216<br>00:23:08,079 –&gt; 00:23:12,559<br>And then let me sort of lay out like the role the names play.</p>
<p>217<br>00:23:12,960 –&gt; 00:23:18,879<br>You know, first of all, you know, you have to do list and you want to share that with somebody else, you don’t have to be able to name that user from sharing.</p>
<p>218<br>00:23:19,679 –&gt; 00:23:22,079<br>And so there’s a sort of mapping from name to user.</p>
<p>219<br>00:23:24,079 –&gt; 00:23:25,039<br>That’s an important role.</p>
<p>220<br>00:23:26,079 –&gt; 00:23:29,599<br>There’s a mapping sort of name to location of data.</p>
<p>221<br>00:23:30,000 –&gt; 00:23:41,519<br>So I have my to do list app, I share, you know, to do list of user one with user two.</p>
<p>222<br>00:23:41,519 –&gt; 00:23:54,079<br>And then, you know, I want to actually retrieve user one wants to use a to use data that needs to be away of actually naming users to do list and actually retrieving it.</p>
<p>223<br>00:23:55,039 –&gt; 00:24:01,519<br>And then, you know, there’s a, simply, there’s a name to public key mapping.</p>
<p>224<br>00:24:02,079 –&gt; 00:24:10,720<br>You know, when I do, you know, successfully retrieve user to use data, you know, probably want to verify that actually was written by user to you.</p>
<p>225<br>00:24:11,039 –&gt; 00:24:20,159<br>And so I’ll probably use user to use public key to verify the integrity of the data retrieved because the storage providers might be, you know, can them you untrust it.</p>
<p>226<br>00:24:20,720 –&gt; 00:24:27,840<br>And what I require is that I can establish what actually uses to public key is in the right will matter.</p>
<p>227<br>00:24:29,519 –&gt; 00:24:38,800<br>And so, you should think about it like in every step of these decentralized applications, you know, a name plays a crucial role.</p>
<p>228<br>00:24:39,759 –&gt; 00:24:48,160<br>And the common name given in particular for, you know, the mapping from names to keys, which is a critical piece.</p>
<p>229<br>00:24:48,400 –&gt; 00:24:51,040<br>This is to be called a public key infrastructure.</p>
<p>230<br>00:25:02,320 –&gt; 00:25:07,840<br>And another, you know, building actually any public key infrastructure is quite challenging.</p>
<p>231<br>00:25:08,720 –&gt; 00:25:13,519<br>You know, you might be familiar with like DNS sec, you know, is a particular way of pushing in the world.</p>
<p>232<br>00:25:13,519 –&gt; 00:25:22,400<br>Web has a certificate has a whole public key infrastructure curve, us in this example of a public key infrastructure.</p>
<p>233<br>00:25:22,879 –&gt; 00:25:28,400<br>And in some ways, with the, you know, the papers that said to do is just build yet another, you know, public key infrastructure.</p>
<p>234<br>00:25:28,639 –&gt; 00:25:30,319<br>That is completely decentralized.</p>
<p>235<br>00:25:36,639 –&gt; 00:25:42,480<br>And that’s sort of the key aspect, you know, this.</p>
<p>236<br>00:25:42,960 –&gt; 00:25:49,759<br>What’s interesting about this naming scheme in in block stack, you know, that’s actually provide to a decent life public key infrastructure.</p>
<p>237<br>00:25:51,200 –&gt; 00:25:54,240<br>Let me try to explain a little bit why, you know, this is challenging.</p>
<p>238<br>00:25:56,160 –&gt; 00:25:56,640<br>So,</p>
<p>239<br>00:25:59,039 –&gt; 00:26:01,759<br>plan sort of paper refers to this in a couple places.</p>
<p>240<br>00:26:02,000 –&gt; 00:26:04,559<br>And says, like, you know, there’s free aspects that you want.</p>
<p>241<br>00:26:05,200 –&gt; 00:26:10,319<br>If you want to sort of general purpose naming infrastructure, you want to be able to have unique names.</p>
<p>242<br>00:26:12,799 –&gt; 00:26:14,640<br>To have a unique name for every user.</p>
<p>243<br>00:26:17,680 –&gt; 00:26:22,640<br>So that you can identify, you know, the particular John, the particular Joe you’re talking about.</p>
<p>244<br>00:26:25,039 –&gt; 00:26:29,279<br>You, when human, human readable names.</p>
<p>245<br>00:26:32,880 –&gt; 00:26:34,079<br>So that’s easy to remember.</p>
<p>246<br>00:26:35,839 –&gt; 00:26:36,880<br>And then in this case,</p>
<p>247<br>00:26:37,840 –&gt; 00:26:41,760<br>and what blocks that also wants is decentralized.</p>
<p>248<br>00:26:46,800 –&gt; 00:26:52,320<br>And you know, the paper, most of it, makes a point that it’s easy to get two of the three.</p>
<p>249<br>00:26:52,320 –&gt; 00:26:55,040<br>It’s very difficult to get all three of them.</p>
<p>250<br>00:26:55,040 –&gt; 00:27:00,080<br>And you know, maybe let’s look at a couple naming systems to see which two they do you get.</p>
<p>251<br>00:27:00,320 –&gt; 00:27:02,160<br>So let’s think about like email dresses.</p>
<p>252<br>00:27:07,120 –&gt; 00:27:08,880<br>Are they, you need names?</p>
<p>253<br>00:27:22,320 –&gt; 00:27:23,120<br>Yes.</p>
<p>254<br>00:27:23,120 –&gt; 00:27:24,400<br>Yep. Like a human readable.</p>
<p>255<br>00:27:25,440 –&gt; 00:27:25,920<br>Yes.</p>
<p>256<br>00:27:26,640 –&gt; 00:27:27,600<br>Are they decentralized?</p>
<p>257<br>00:27:28,240 –&gt; 00:27:28,720<br>No.</p>
<p>258<br>00:27:29,040 –&gt; 00:27:29,280<br>No.</p>
<p>259<br>00:27:29,280 –&gt; 00:27:31,440<br>So these are, these are get two of these guys, correct?</p>
<p>260<br>00:27:31,440 –&gt; 00:27:32,400<br>But not the third one.</p>
<p>261<br>00:27:33,200 –&gt; 00:27:36,320<br>How about random public keys?</p>
<p>262<br>00:27:36,320 –&gt; 00:27:41,600<br>Or maybe like if the paper uses hashish of the file content to actually get a name, correct?</p>
<p>263<br>00:27:41,600 –&gt; 00:27:43,280<br>For the, for things.</p>
<p>264<br>00:27:43,280 –&gt; 00:27:46,480<br>So basically, okay, so random public keys.</p>
<p>265<br>00:27:48,000 –&gt; 00:27:51,680<br>Which I mean, just public keys get the random, but presumably random.</p>
<p>266<br>00:27:55,200 –&gt; 00:27:56,960<br>So public keys are they unique?</p>
<p>267<br>00:27:59,280 –&gt; 00:27:59,519<br>Yep.</p>
<p>268<br>00:27:59,519 –&gt; 00:28:00,000<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>269<br>00:28:00,000 –&gt; 00:28:00,480<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>270<br>00:28:00,799 –&gt; 00:28:01,360<br>Yep.</p>
<p>271<br>00:28:01,360 –&gt; 00:28:02,720<br>Are they a human readable?</p>
<p>272<br>00:28:03,360 –&gt; 00:28:03,839<br>No.</p>
<p>273<br>00:28:03,839 –&gt; 00:28:04,400<br>No.</p>
<p>274<br>00:28:04,400 –&gt; 00:28:05,440<br>Are they decentralized?</p>
<p>275<br>00:28:06,000 –&gt; 00:28:06,640<br>Yes.</p>
<p>276<br>00:28:06,640 –&gt; 00:28:06,880<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>277<br>00:28:06,880 –&gt; 00:28:12,160<br>You can generate them, you know, high probability in a unique manner, completely decentralized, correct?</p>
<p>278<br>00:28:13,920 –&gt; 00:28:18,400<br>So I’m talking to you, you should have done that more in last three with these cleric IDs.</p>
<p>279<br>00:28:18,400 –&gt; 00:28:22,640<br>So you’re, we get like, again, two of the three, but not the human readable one.</p>
<p>280<br>00:28:23,360 –&gt; 00:28:26,240<br>Let’s see, can we actually get human readable and decentralized?</p>
<p>281<br>00:28:28,000 –&gt; 00:28:28,960<br>You think of an example?</p>
<p>282<br>00:28:30,480 –&gt; 00:28:31,440<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>283<br>00:28:34,799 –&gt; 00:28:37,599<br>Is that like a peer-to-peer file sharing?</p>
<p>284<br>00:28:39,920 –&gt; 00:28:40,400<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>285<br>00:28:40,400 –&gt; 00:28:44,880<br>It’s not whatever’s unique, the files, but they’re human readable and decentralized.</p>
<p>286<br>00:28:44,880 –&gt; 00:28:45,839<br>Yeah, no, think simpler.</p>
<p>287<br>00:28:47,279 –&gt; 00:28:48,559<br>You know, think about your phone.</p>
<p>288<br>00:28:54,160 –&gt; 00:28:57,120<br>The example, you always use a good one, it’s like you contact list.</p>
<p>289<br>00:29:01,440 –&gt; 00:29:02,640<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>290<br>00:29:02,640 –&gt; 00:29:04,880<br>The names in your contact list are you in remal.</p>
<p>291<br>00:29:04,880 –&gt; 00:29:11,759<br>You know, decentralized, you know, you can have John, you know, in the entry for John one phone number.</p>
<p>292<br>00:29:11,759 –&gt; 00:29:15,519<br>And I can have another phone number from my John entry.</p>
<p>293<br>00:29:15,519 –&gt; 00:29:16,720<br>And they’re probably different people.</p>
<p>294<br>00:29:17,519 –&gt; 00:29:20,960<br>But, you know, the, you know, I can pick the names in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>295<br>00:29:21,680 –&gt; 00:29:23,120<br>And they’re certainly human readable.</p>
<p>296<br>00:29:23,120 –&gt; 00:29:23,759<br>Are they unique?</p>
<p>297<br>00:29:27,360 –&gt; 00:29:28,079<br>No, right?</p>
<p>298<br>00:29:28,639 –&gt; 00:29:33,759<br>Which is like, you have your list of names, I have my list of names and they may actually overlap</p>
<p>299<br>00:29:33,759 –&gt; 00:29:35,119<br>and still talk about different people.</p>
<p>300<br>00:29:36,399 –&gt; 00:29:40,799<br>So the year, sort of, what the paper is trying to get at that, actually getting too out of the free</p>
<p>301<br>00:29:41,599 –&gt; 00:29:47,359<br>is quite common or very easy, but actually getting all free of them is hard.</p>
<p>302<br>00:29:52,000 –&gt; 00:29:56,559<br>And the paper says like, well, we actually, we achieve all free of them.</p>
<p>303<br>00:29:56,720 –&gt; 00:30:00,319<br>Maybe we get the unique names, we get you in redol and decentralized, right?</p>
<p>304<br>00:30:02,000 –&gt; 00:30:09,279<br>And in the way, in some ways, they get this and it is to basically exploit the blockchain.</p>
<p>305<br>00:30:10,639 –&gt; 00:30:11,200<br>So the</p>
<p>306<br>00:30:15,119 –&gt; 00:30:16,319<br>So block stacks approach.</p>
<p>307<br>00:30:27,519 –&gt; 00:30:32,319<br>And really the blood that they, they to be fair, is really not black, black,</p>
<p>308<br>00:30:32,879 –&gt; 00:30:38,720<br>black stack superiors is really name coins approach that they sort of adopted.</p>
<p>309<br>00:30:40,240 –&gt; 00:30:41,599<br>The basic idea is very simple.</p>
<p>310<br>00:30:42,720 –&gt; 00:30:46,799<br>You know, we’re going to take advantage of the existence of the Bitcoin block stack with the</p>
<p>311<br>00:30:46,799 –&gt; 00:30:52,000<br>Bitcoin blockchain. And of course, you could use any other blockchain, but like, you know,</p>
<p>312<br>00:30:52,000 –&gt; 00:30:55,519<br>just for concreteness, you know, we’re going to think about the Bitcoin one.</p>
<p>313<br>00:30:56,000 –&gt; 00:31:02,559<br>And so here we got our chain, you know, transactions that sit in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>314<br>00:31:03,920 –&gt; 00:31:09,039<br>and I’m going to groove over time, you know, my news at new transactions.</p>
<p>315<br>00:31:09,039 –&gt; 00:31:14,799<br>And the way we’re going to basically create a naming system is we’re going to just post</p>
<p>316<br>00:31:14,799 –&gt; 00:31:18,720<br>transactions that sort of for different type that basically claim a name.</p>
<p>317<br>00:31:19,440 –&gt; 00:31:24,000<br>And so for that ball, you know, we might actually have, you know, so these special transactions.</p>
<p>318<br>00:31:26,000 –&gt; 00:31:30,400<br>Every transaction actually turns out in Bitcoin has a metadata field and you can basically</p>
<p>319<br>00:31:30,400 –&gt; 00:31:36,079<br>stick anything in the metadata field you want. And so what we’re going to stick in there is a name record.</p>
<p>320<br>00:31:36,639 –&gt; 00:31:39,759<br>So we’re going to have some transaction and then we’re going to stick a name record in there.</p>
<p>321<br>00:31:41,440 –&gt; 00:31:44,799<br>We’ll see you little one in a second, but exactly the details of this name record is,</p>
<p>322<br>00:31:45,440 –&gt; 00:31:50,480<br>but in the case of block stack, you know, it’s basically a name like 684.</p>
<p>323<br>00:31:51,440 –&gt; 00:31:55,279<br>And then, you know, maybe as we see later, a hash of the zone file.</p>
<p>324<br>00:31:56,960 –&gt; 00:32:04,240<br>And in the basic rule in the scheme is going to be that the first one,</p>
<p>325<br>00:32:05,039 –&gt; 00:32:08,880<br>the first, you know, user, the first name record basically wins.</p>
<p>326<br>00:32:14,240 –&gt; 00:32:17,039<br>Right, so there might be a second, you know, somebody else creates, you know,</p>
<p>327<br>00:32:17,119 –&gt; 00:32:18,480<br>the name 684 later.</p>
<p>328<br>00:32:20,000 –&gt; 00:32:22,399<br>But because you know, the 6.684</p>
<p>329<br>00:32:24,319 –&gt; 00:32:30,879<br>shows up later in the Bitcoin blockchain, we’re going to basically ignore that one.</p>
<p>330<br>00:32:31,599 –&gt; 00:32:38,240<br>And you know, only, you know, consider that the valid name record for 684.</p>
<p>331<br>00:32:38,240 –&gt; 00:32:42,799<br>Right. And this completely, you know, plays off, you know, the fact that there is basically</p>
<p>332<br>00:32:42,799 –&gt; 00:32:48,639<br>the blockchain is a wall of all the operations ever happened.</p>
<p>333<br>00:32:49,359 –&gt; 00:32:52,639<br>They’re in order, there’s consensus in what order they happened.</p>
<p>334<br>00:32:53,119 –&gt; 00:32:58,799<br>And so from that, you know, we’ve been basically construct, if you will, like a database,</p>
<p>335<br>00:32:58,799 –&gt; 00:33:01,759<br>a database with all the names in the world, you know, we just go through the blockchain</p>
<p>336<br>00:33:01,759 –&gt; 00:33:07,519<br>from the beginning of time, find all the valid transactions, name transactions,</p>
<p>337<br>00:33:07,519 –&gt; 00:33:13,440<br>and use that to construct a database with all the, we’ve all developed names.</p>
<p>338<br>00:33:14,160 –&gt; 00:33:19,039<br>And in some ways, you know, a number of people sort of pointed this out, like, isn’t this exactly,</p>
<p>339<br>00:33:19,039 –&gt; 00:33:23,359<br>you know, we’ve been doing like, LaFrie, where, you know, we have a log, like, raft, you know,</p>
<p>340<br>00:33:23,359 –&gt; 00:33:29,680<br>provide to log, we stick operations in the log, you know, we run, you know, the operations</p>
<p>341<br>00:33:30,240 –&gt; 00:33:34,639<br>and, and that’s constructs, you know, a state, you know, where the state in this case would be</p>
<p>342<br>00:33:34,720 –&gt; 00:33:40,480<br>a naming database. And there’s, you know, I think it’s exactly that kind of style in the same idea,</p>
<p>343<br>00:33:40,480 –&gt; 00:33:43,920<br>except there’s small differences here, right? You know, we’re not using graph to get</p>
<p>344<br>00:33:43,920 –&gt; 00:33:50,880<br>processes, we’re again, we’re using Bitcoin or Nakamoto to get Nakamoto consensus to actually achieve</p>
<p>345<br>00:33:52,240 –&gt; 00:33:58,640<br>one single blockchain, but in spirit, you know, yes, you know, it’s very similar.</p>
<p>346<br>00:33:58,720 –&gt; 00:34:04,720<br>Okay, so let’s think a little bit about it.</p>
<p>347<br>00:34:05,920 –&gt; 00:34:11,360<br>Yeah, our free properties, you know, first of all, you know, do we get unique names?</p>
<p>348<br>00:34:18,079 –&gt; 00:34:21,599<br>Yes. Yeah, we get unique names, correct? Because the first one wins.</p>
<p>349<br>00:34:21,599 –&gt; 00:34:33,279<br>Is it decentralized? Yes. Yeah, it’s decentralized, you know, by sort of virtue of Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>350<br>00:34:36,559 –&gt; 00:34:41,440<br>And the consensus and the log basically makes it sure that we can actually identify what the</p>
<p>351<br>00:34:41,440 –&gt; 00:34:46,000<br>first name is so that we can actually pick a unique name. This is human readable.</p>
<p>352<br>00:34:46,719 –&gt; 00:34:50,480<br>Can be. Yeah, I get exactly.</p>
<p>353<br>00:34:53,199 –&gt; 00:34:57,199<br>Certainly my string 68 to 4 is hopefully unreadable.</p>
<p>354<br>00:35:02,239 –&gt; 00:35:04,079<br>Okay, so it seems like it was sort of on the first,</p>
<p>355<br>00:35:05,280 –&gt; 00:35:10,400<br>brought, you know, sweep, where it looks like indeed, you know, we got the free properties,</p>
<p>356<br>00:35:10,400 –&gt; 00:35:14,159<br>right? A couple of new readable, we got the uniqueness, and we got the decentralized one.</p>
<p>357<br>00:35:14,879 –&gt; 00:35:20,719<br>And I think a really name coin was sort of the first naming system demonstrated that</p>
<p>358<br>00:35:20,719 –&gt; 00:35:26,079<br>could be achieved in this way. Now, you know, it’s not completely perfect, right?</p>
<p>359<br>00:35:27,519 –&gt; 00:35:31,519<br>Like, so example, even though we got sort of unique names and the unique readable,</p>
<p>360<br>00:35:31,519 –&gt; 00:35:36,639<br>we don’t really know like what 68 to 4 really means, correct? I don’t know, like you see 68 to 4,</p>
<p>361<br>00:35:36,639 –&gt; 00:35:43,759<br>and what does 68 to 4 refer to? It’s like a part number, or is it a class number, or anything?</p>
<p>362<br>00:35:43,760 –&gt; 00:35:47,440<br>We don’t really know like how to interpret names, but you know, this field of unreadable.</p>
<p>363<br>00:35:47,440 –&gt; 00:35:51,120<br>So it’s not completely perfect. It’s not like identifying uniquely some, you know,</p>
<p>364<br>00:35:51,120 –&gt; 00:35:55,200<br>user in the world, right? Or even like, you know, whatever you were done,</p>
<p>365<br>00:35:55,200 –&gt; 00:36:01,280<br>cash, that doesn’t really uniquely identify one person, right? So whenever you see a name,</p>
<p>366<br>00:36:01,280 –&gt; 00:36:05,120<br>you’re just sort of still the issue of like who it actually really is.</p>
<p>367<br>00:36:07,520 –&gt; 00:36:13,440<br>And also, there’s sort of a similar, you know, related issue, why it’s not completely perfect,</p>
<p>368<br>00:36:14,160 –&gt; 00:36:20,880<br>which is like, how do you find somebody’s name? And, you know, how do you find actually,</p>
<p>369<br>00:36:20,880 –&gt; 00:36:26,160<br>you know, what a cash rich name? Or, and how do you, you know, how do you find that?</p>
<p>370<br>00:36:26,160 –&gt; 00:36:31,200<br>I do know which record actually goes with which particular user. So, you know, although, so,</p>
<p>371<br>00:36:31,200 –&gt; 00:36:35,920<br>although the system is quite cool because it has these decent,</p>
<p>372<br>00:36:35,920 –&gt; 00:36:41,120<br>nice uniqueness and unreadable aspects to it, it’s not completely perfect. These are generally</p>
<p>373<br>00:36:41,119 –&gt; 00:36:46,400<br>issues with general naming systems, but certainly true here too. So it’s not the case that, you know,</p>
<p>374<br>00:36:46,400 –&gt; 00:36:52,719<br>we’re, you know, we sort of solved all naming problems in one single swoop. We do have, you know,</p>
<p>375<br>00:36:52,719 –&gt; 00:36:58,799<br>a good standing position to work with, but you know, it’s not a, you know, to complete 100% hit.</p>
<p>376<br>00:37:01,759 –&gt; 00:37:08,239<br>But so, yeah, just a question. So, name coin, all they did was add essentially this like record to the,</p>
<p>377<br>00:37:09,119 –&gt; 00:37:11,759<br>the like, uh, transaction.</p>
<p>378<br>00:37:14,000 –&gt; 00:37:16,799<br>I think we did a little bit more now, correct? I ran the room blockchain,</p>
<p>379<br>00:37:18,000 –&gt; 00:37:24,559<br>independent of Bitcoin and, uh, and, and, and use that blockchain, they’re purely for naming.</p>
<p>380<br>00:37:25,759 –&gt; 00:37:30,879<br>And they had also bunch of rules about, like, you know, how much money, how many name coins</p>
<p>381<br>00:37:30,879 –&gt; 00:37:36,000<br>you have to pay to get a particular name and, uh, there’s all kinds of other extensions that</p>
<p>382<br>00:37:36,079 –&gt; 00:37:41,199<br>I haven’t really discussed yet, were mentioned, but they sort of, you know, followed this particular</p>
<p>383<br>00:37:41,199 –&gt; 00:37:48,719<br>approach. And we’re the first sort of to do so. In the many pragmatic issues, right, that, uh,</p>
<p>384<br>00:37:48,719 –&gt; 00:37:56,880<br>the paper touches on, and I haven’t mentioned it all yet. Any other questions?</p>
<p>385<br>00:37:57,360 –&gt; 00:38:09,280<br>Okay. So, let’s actually dive in a little bit on the, sort of, the practical issues,</p>
<p>386<br>00:38:10,000 –&gt; 00:38:13,920<br>although there’s a slightly different nature than we, we want to be just talked about. It really is, but</p>
<p>387<br>00:38:15,920 –&gt; 00:38:24,720<br>how to actually implement, uh, decentralized apps, uh, and the naming system, uh, by leveraging, uh, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>388<br>00:38:27,599 –&gt; 00:38:48,800<br>And the, the bunch of, uh, the bunch of, so just, you know, pragmatic issues, uh, there’s</p>
<p>389<br>00:38:48,800 –&gt; 00:38:50,800<br>limits on the amount of data you can put in a,</p>
<p>390<br>00:38:53,840 –&gt; 00:39:02,560<br>on data size in a transaction. So, although maybe it’s perfectly fine to have a name, uh,</p>
<p>391<br>00:39:02,560 –&gt; 00:39:09,760<br>value, uh, binding into, uh, into the, uh, into a Bitcoin transaction, you know, we can’t put like</p>
<p>392<br>00:39:09,760 –&gt; 00:39:13,680<br>our to-do list inside of the transaction. And so, you know, we’ve got to have some plan,</p>
<p>393<br>00:39:14,400 –&gt; 00:39:17,600<br>uh, for actually how that, you know, part is going to work out.</p>
<p>394<br>00:39:18,800 –&gt; 00:39:24,560<br>It has slower rights. So, you know, from the last lecture, you know, it takes a while, you know,</p>
<p>395<br>00:39:24,560 –&gt; 00:39:29,920<br>for rights actually, uh, were transactions to propagate. And, uh, before they, uh,</p>
<p>396<br>00:39:29,920 –&gt; 00:39:34,480<br>presented to be, uh, really stable, like, cannot be, uh, forked off anymore. You know, we,</p>
<p>397<br>00:39:34,480 –&gt; 00:39:39,360<br>when we were talking about, like, you know, four, five, six, uh, blocks later in the chain, you know,</p>
<p>398<br>00:39:39,360 –&gt; 00:39:44,160<br>and you block us ten minutes, so, you know, an hour later, right? Uh, and so, this is really not so</p>
<p>399<br>00:39:44,159 –&gt; 00:39:49,920<br>cool if you’re sticker, uh, to-do list inside of the, uh, blockchain two, uh, because, you know, I</p>
<p>400<br>00:39:49,920 –&gt; 00:39:54,879<br>will modify my blockchain, I’ll modify my to-do list, and I’ll, like, an hour later, maybe actually observe it.</p>
<p>401<br>00:39:54,879 –&gt; 00:39:59,359<br>So, that seems not so good, and you want to go through more aggressive applications where, like,</p>
<p>402<br>00:39:59,359 –&gt; 00:40:05,199<br>there’s much more data that’s manipulated, you know, we certainly, uh, a problem, you know, and, uh,</p>
<p>403<br>00:40:05,199 –&gt; 00:40:09,119<br>and similarly, you know, in addition to slow rights, you know, there’s also a low, low, low throughput,</p>
<p>404<br>00:40:09,119 –&gt; 00:40:10,719<br>low bandwidth.</p>
<p>405<br>00:40:15,679 –&gt; 00:40:17,599<br>In the numerous, there’s only a few transactions.</p>
<p>406<br>00:40:19,519 –&gt; 00:40:23,679<br>For seconds, correct? So, we’re going to do a lot of rights, you know, through file, uh,</p>
<p>407<br>00:40:23,679 –&gt; 00:40:28,559<br>at many times, even though we’re also going running the, uh, the, the file operations through</p>
<p>408<br>00:40:28,559 –&gt; 00:40:33,519<br>the blockchain. So, uh, so clearly, you know, you know, we got to be a little bit, if we want to really</p>
<p>409<br>00:40:33,519 –&gt; 00:40:39,519<br>build a general purpose, uh, infrastructure for, uh, uh, decentralized applications, you know,</p>
<p>410<br>00:40:39,519 –&gt; 00:40:45,119<br>there needs to be a more complete story that actually allows us to get, like, uh, fast rights,</p>
<p>411<br>00:40:45,119 –&gt; 00:40:49,840<br>you know, high bandwidth rights, uh, and it gets us around, and, you know, basically, not running</p>
<p>412<br>00:40:49,840 –&gt; 00:40:54,719<br>everything through the blockchain. The paper also talked about one other final problem, the ledger,</p>
<p>413<br>00:40:54,719 –&gt; 00:41:00,079<br>ever-grown ledger, uh, and, uh, I’m not going to actually spend much time, I’m talking about</p>
<p>414<br>00:41:00,079 –&gt; 00:41:04,239<br>that at all, uh, but that’s clearly an also an issue that you wanted to, and, and, and, and,</p>
<p>415<br>00:41:04,239 –&gt; 00:41:07,840<br>and you know, say, that you’re putting the paper, you’re, you’re going to boot up, uh, block stack nodes,</p>
<p>416<br>00:41:08,480 –&gt; 00:41:12,319<br>uh, if you do a sort of, uh, and the traditional sort of Bitcoin style, where, you know,</p>
<p>417<br>00:41:12,319 –&gt; 00:41:15,920<br>you’re going to run through all the Trekkings, there’s actually one by one that will take a while before</p>
<p>418<br>00:41:15,920 –&gt; 00:41:20,319<br>you actually have build up a complete naming record. And, in particular, in the case of block stackers,</p>
<p>419<br>00:41:20,319 –&gt; 00:41:24,079<br>it’s a little bit annoying because a lot of the transactions that are in the blockchain are</p>
<p>420<br>00:41:24,079 –&gt; 00:41:28,079<br>completely in a relative to block stack. Right? There, uh, there are a lot of transactions for</p>
<p>421<br>00:41:28,079 –&gt; 00:41:33,440<br>completing some different purpose, uh, and have nothing to do with, uh, the block stack, uh, approach,</p>
<p>422<br>00:41:33,440 –&gt; 00:41:38,079<br>but, you know, block stack, if you really literally were using, uh, the Bitcoin blockchain, as you</p>
<p>423<br>00:41:38,079 –&gt; 00:41:41,360<br>were following the main thing, you know, you would have to go through and interpret and over the M and C,</p>
<p>424<br>00:41:41,360 –&gt; 00:41:47,679<br>which ones actually need to reply. Okay, so, I’m going to focus more on sort of these, these,</p>
<p>425<br>00:41:47,679 –&gt; 00:41:52,719<br>the first couple, uh, challenges, which is like, you know, basically what we want to do is like,</p>
<p>426<br>00:41:52,719 –&gt; 00:41:59,199<br>minimize the use of the, uh, blockchain, uh, yeah, so that we can, I know we actually get high,</p>
<p>427<br>00:41:59,199 –&gt; 00:42:05,679<br>you know, like the ones right, so we’re in decent bandwidth. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>428<br>00:42:11,359 –&gt; 00:42:16,799<br>Good, and that sort of gets us to the core of the paper, uh, which is like, uh, the,</p>
<p>429<br>00:42:17,760 –&gt; 00:42:20,560<br>we can pull up that diagram so we can look at it,</p>
<p>430<br>00:42:23,200 –&gt; 00:42:28,720<br>and that’s basically this diagram. And that sort of describes, you know, the general approach, uh,</p>
<p>431<br>00:42:28,720 –&gt; 00:42:33,440<br>that, uh, the paper takes through the drastically, you know, the challenges that I just laid out</p>
<p>432<br>00:42:33,440 –&gt; 00:42:42,160<br>on the previous board. Okay, so these are a complicated picture, and so let’s go,</p>
<p>433<br>00:42:42,239 –&gt; 00:42:45,599<br>sort of later by layer, we’ll try to understand actually how things work.</p>
<p>434<br>00:42:50,399 –&gt; 00:42:56,639<br>So at the, at the bottom, you know, is the, is the Bitcoin chain?</p>
<p>435<br>00:43:02,079 –&gt; 00:43:07,920<br>Uh, and in the Bitcoin chain, there are lots and lots of transactions, and, uh, many of these</p>
<p>436<br>00:43:07,920 –&gt; 00:43:13,840<br>transactions have absolutely nothing to do with, uh, the block stack, and the block stack,</p>
<p>437<br>00:43:19,280 –&gt; 00:43:23,200<br>and the block stack transactions are sort of sort of sitting in, you know, a particular</p>
<p>438<br>00:43:23,200 –&gt; 00:43:29,680<br>block in the blockchain. And then there’s sort of the second layer, which is really the block stack</p>
<p>439<br>00:43:29,680 –&gt; 00:43:35,440<br>notes that basically read all these transactions, that fish out the ones that are actually</p>
<p>440<br>00:43:35,440 –&gt; 00:43:42,320<br>related to, uh, block stack interpret, you know, those operations and, you know, build up, uh,</p>
<p>441<br>00:43:42,320 –&gt; 00:43:47,119<br>a block stack database with names to, uh, what turns out to be zone file hashers.</p>
<p>442<br>00:43:47,840 –&gt; 00:43:52,720<br>So we look at these operations, what, and what’s in there? So in every, uh, Bitcoin</p>
<p>443<br>00:43:52,720 –&gt; 00:43:56,559<br>connection, as I mentioned earlier, you can have some metadata that sits in the, what’s called</p>
<p>444<br>00:43:56,559 –&gt; 00:44:02,320<br>the op, in the score return field. And in that op, on the score return field, uh, there is basically,</p>
<p>445<br>00:44:02,320 –&gt; 00:44:10,240<br>uh, a, a, a name, say X, uh, plus, you know, the hash of zone file.</p>
<p>446<br>00:44:16,000 –&gt; 00:44:21,920<br>And that’s sort of the binding that sits in Bitcoin, and that, you know, basically block stack,</p>
<p>447<br>00:44:21,920 –&gt; 00:44:27,200<br>which uses, uh, Bitcoin to basically make that binding from hand, from name to a zone file,</p>
<p>448<br>00:44:27,679 –&gt; 00:44:38,559<br>uh, unique, uh, uh, uh, uh, in a decentralized manner. So as, you know, like in Latvry, or in any other,</p>
<p>449<br>00:44:38,559 –&gt; 00:44:47,599<br>sort of logging system, uh, the, these, block stack nodes interpret these, uh, particular, uh, name,</p>
<p>450<br>00:44:47,599 –&gt; 00:44:53,199<br>uh, transactions. Look at the op field, uh, see that this op field is for example to create a</p>
<p>451<br>00:44:53,199 –&gt; 00:44:59,759<br>particular name, and basically store it in the database, the, you know, the, the, the binding from</p>
<p>452<br>00:44:59,759 –&gt; 00:45:05,439<br>name, X, you know, to the hash of the zone file. And, you know, once a while, as you’ll see,</p>
<p>453<br>00:45:05,439 –&gt; 00:45:10,399<br>the second user may want to update the zone file. And so you might see multiple transactions for</p>
<p>454<br>00:45:10,399 –&gt; 00:45:16,960<br>the same, uh, user, uh, updating basically the hash of the zone file. Of course, we want to minimize,</p>
<p>455<br>00:45:16,960 –&gt; 00:45:22,079<br>you know, these, uh, changes because you know, every change, you know, through the, uh, would require,</p>
<p>456<br>00:45:23,440 –&gt; 00:45:28,800<br>would require a modification, or posting a Bitcoin transaction, uh, and, you know, for many reasons</p>
<p>457<br>00:45:28,800 –&gt; 00:45:32,320<br>that are on the previous slide, that’s slow, which we like to try to avoid it, for the more, then it will</p>
<p>458<br>00:45:32,320 –&gt; 00:45:36,720<br>cost a little bit of money. Uh, I mean, because these transactions, they actually need to be processed.</p>
<p>459<br>00:45:38,400 –&gt; 00:45:45,840<br>And so, um, uh, so, uh, so the basic plan, so this, this, this, this, this, this node layer,</p>
<p>460<br>00:45:45,840 –&gt; 00:45:52,079<br>this, the virtual chain layer basically builds this database of mappings for a name to hash zone file.</p>
<p>461<br>00:45:52,880 –&gt; 00:45:58,400<br>Uh, yeah, of course, also filters out all the, uh, transactions that are invalid, or like, you know,</p>
<p>462<br>00:45:58,400 –&gt; 00:46:06,079<br>a new access that being created after the first one. Uh, and then, uh, using the hash of the zone file,</p>
<p>463<br>00:46:06,079 –&gt; 00:46:13,440<br>you know, which we got, uh, it locates, uh, an application can locate, um, the zone file.</p>
<p>464<br>00:46:13,440 –&gt; 00:46:18,240<br>And the zone file can come out from anywhere, uh, and because we have to hash with the zone file,</p>
<p>465<br>00:46:18,240 –&gt; 00:46:22,320<br>when we retrieve a file that claims to be the zone file, we can re-compute the hash,</p>
<p>466<br>00:46:22,320 –&gt; 00:46:27,119<br>if the hash is identical to the one that we got sort of through, uh, indirectly through Bitcoin,</p>
<p>467<br>00:46:27,119 –&gt; 00:46:31,280<br>then we know for sure that that is the, the zone file that goes with x.</p>
<p>468<br>00:46:33,280 –&gt; 00:46:38,960<br>And so, okay, what is that in, uh, the zone files? Well, in, in the zone file is,</p>
<p>469<br>00:46:38,960 –&gt; 00:46:45,039<br>maybe sort of, and yet another table, if you will, both mapping names, uh, to URIs. So,</p>
<p>470<br>00:46:45,039 –&gt; 00:46:49,840<br>from sample, you know, you might have a zone file, which has, you know, like, maybe for the to-do app,</p>
<p>471<br>00:46:50,480 –&gt; 00:46:55,280<br>that’s an entry to-do, and, you know, it up points to a URI.</p>
<p>472<br>00:46:56,880 –&gt; 00:47:00,000<br>Uh, we’re actually the data is located for, you know, to, to-do list.</p>
<p>473<br>00:47:01,039 –&gt; 00:47:06,480<br>Um, and, you know, there’s sort of two types of zone files. One is what they’re called immutable,</p>
<p>474<br>00:47:06,480 –&gt; 00:47:11,519<br>and one is demutable. Demutable ones have URI plus a, a public key.</p>
<p>475<br>00:47:15,280 –&gt; 00:47:22,079<br>So, uh, and this is a public key, you know, is the key to actually validate, uh, where the,</p>
<p>476<br>00:47:22,079 –&gt; 00:47:25,519<br>whether the file was written by the user x. So, basically the user x, you know,</p>
<p>477<br>00:47:25,519 –&gt; 00:47:32,400<br>publishes through the zone file a public key for him or herself. And later on, uh, when, you know,</p>
<p>478<br>00:47:32,400 –&gt; 00:47:36,960<br>user 2 wants to look at user x, you know, it gets the hash of the zone file, the hash of,</p>
<p>479<br>00:47:36,960 –&gt; 00:47:42,639<br>finds the zone file, double checks the to-zone file, you know, uh, hashes to the right value,</p>
<p>480<br>00:47:42,639 –&gt; 00:47:49,680<br>looks as inside the, the, the zone file, finds the, you know, the public key of x, and, you know,</p>
<p>481<br>00:47:49,680 –&gt; 00:47:58,079<br>the URI, you know, for the to-do file, uh, uses the URI to fetch, uh, the actual to-do file, uh, check,</p>
<p>482<br>00:47:58,079 –&gt; 00:48:02,559<br>you know, the signature on the retreat file with the public key, and if it all checks out, then</p>
<p>483<br>00:48:02,559 –&gt; 00:48:11,039<br>basically user 2 knows, you know, okay, I got, you know, user x, uh, zone file. And then it might be</p>
<p>484<br>00:48:11,039 –&gt; 00:48:16,639<br>also like other names in this zone file, like whatever, you know, users to- you access tweets,</p>
<p>485<br>00:48:17,920 –&gt; 00:48:22,480<br>et cetera, timeline, what, you know, for every application, there’s probably an entry, and, you</p>
<p>486<br>00:48:22,480 –&gt; 00:48:26,480<br>know, probably the applications sort of agree on like, you know, what name to use for a particular</p>
<p>487<br>00:48:26,480 –&gt; 00:48:34,079<br>application. Um, so don’t we lose the like data, your ability, guarantees where like, it’s</p>
<p>488<br>00:48:34,079 –&gt; 00:48:38,159<br>possible this data could be deleted, and then you wouldn’t have the hash and data could just be lost.</p>
<p>489<br>00:48:38,880 –&gt; 00:48:41,599<br>So it’s, you mean like the, the zone file can get lost?</p>
<p>490<br>00:48:42,559 –&gt; 00:48:46,719<br>Right, like, like with the chain, you can’t lose data because it’ll be replicated enough places</p>
<p>491<br>00:48:46,719 –&gt; 00:48:50,159<br>but here, it’s not gonna have a guarantee rate. Good, good, good. So, so, so, sometimes after zone</p>
<p>492<br>00:48:50,159 –&gt; 00:48:54,159<br>files also replicated widely on the, basically, there’s a course in a walkstack node to</p>
<p>493<br>00:48:54,159 –&gt; 00:48:59,199<br>dole replicated, uh, the zone files are everybody. Um, and, uh, and then they’re, they’re,</p>
<p>494<br>00:48:59,199 –&gt; 00:49:03,199<br>apparently, their zone files are a reasonable small like for, uh, for kilobytes or something in that</p>
<p>495<br>00:49:03,199 –&gt; 00:49:09,119<br>order. And so they can be replicated everywhere, okay? Then for the, to do for a list,</p>
<p>496<br>00:49:09,119 –&gt; 00:49:15,679<br>right, the, to do file, the UI, uh, the basic idea is that, you know, you might store the same data</p>
<p>497<br>00:49:15,679 –&gt; 00:49:20,079<br>or, and multiple providers. So, example, you might want to have like, you replicated it as free,</p>
<p>498<br>00:49:20,719 –&gt; 00:49:28,799<br>and maybe, you know, you also stick it in Google direct. And, uh, one reason that actually blocks</p>
<p>499<br>00:49:28,799 –&gt; 00:49:33,759<br>that has storage, uh, service is not because actually they store the data, but basically,</p>
<p>500<br>00:49:33,759 –&gt; 00:49:36,960<br>provide a uniform API to all these different storage providers.</p>
<p>501<br>00:49:43,199 –&gt; 00:49:46,559<br>Okay, so there’s, does that make sense?</p>
<p>502<br>00:49:50,400 –&gt; 00:49:54,239<br>Okay, so then there’s a, uh, there’s a, there’s a mention zone files in two ways.</p>
<p>503<br>00:49:54,239 –&gt; 00:49:58,719<br>Uh, there’s another, which is a called immutable storage, and that actually contains, you know,</p>
<p>504<br>00:49:58,719 –&gt; 00:50:06,880<br>the URI, the name, URI, um, pop the key,</p>
<p>505<br>00:50:10,159 –&gt; 00:50:18,719<br>and the hash of the data, with the file. And so you can basically verify, you know,</p>
<p>506<br>00:50:18,719 –&gt; 00:50:24,799<br>is this indeed the latest version of the, uh, the file, uh, because in this scheme, you get to</p>
<p>507<br>00:50:24,799 –&gt; 00:50:30,000<br>update, you know, X can update the file, but it’s hard to tell, uh, for user two, whether that is</p>
<p>508<br>00:50:30,000 –&gt; 00:50:33,919<br>actually the latest version, uh, the paper mentions that they’re, you know, you probably want to stick</p>
<p>509<br>00:50:33,919 –&gt; 00:50:37,919<br>version numbers in it. Uh, but if you really want to guarantee to be sort of the latest version for</p>
<p>510<br>00:50:37,919 –&gt; 00:50:43,439<br>a particular name, uh, in a huge immutable storage, you know, then, uh, the mutable storage contains</p>
<p>511<br>00:50:43,440 –&gt; 00:50:48,960<br>the hash of the file, and uh, that uniquely identifies a particular version of the paper data file.</p>
<p>512<br>00:50:49,599 –&gt; 00:50:56,320<br>That does mean, like, if you update, you know, this record, then, uh, that really means you update the</p>
<p>513<br>00:50:56,320 –&gt; 00:51:02,800<br>zone file, so that means you have to republish or recreate a log entry in the Bitcoin chain,</p>
<p>514<br>00:51:03,440 –&gt; 00:51:07,440<br>mapping, you know, X to a new hash, uh, hash zone file.</p>
<p>515<br>00:51:07,440 –&gt; 00:51:18,000<br>Okay, so this is sort of the overall picture, uh, for the, uh, for the system, and as you can see,</p>
<p>516<br>00:51:18,000 –&gt; 00:51:24,880<br>you know, uh, particularly like, you know, in this to-do list site, uh, you know, the user, uh, X can</p>
<p>517<br>00:51:24,880 –&gt; 00:51:32,000<br>actually update, uh, it’s, uh, uh, he’s a, uh, to the list, uh, without actually having to publish a</p>
<p>518<br>00:51:32,079 –&gt; 00:51:38,079<br>new record in the, uh, in the Bitcoin chain. In fact, you know, the only thing that really has to be</p>
<p>519<br>00:51:38,079 –&gt; 00:51:43,920<br>created in the Bitcoin chain is just, you know, X’s name, uh, and X of course might have many other names</p>
<p>520<br>00:51:43,920 –&gt; 00:51:51,199<br>that are sitting in the zone files, uh, in, uh, in, uh, but, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>521<br>00:51:51,920 –&gt; 00:51:56,800<br>the system doesn’t rely on, uh, for every operation on, uh, on the blockchain.</p>
<p>522<br>00:51:56,800 –&gt; 00:52:02,480<br>And what you get is what, around, it gets us around a lot of these problems of, you know, flow rights,</p>
<p>523<br>00:52:02,480 –&gt; 00:52:09,280<br>long bandwidth, uh, in the limits on the, uh, and the limits on the, uh, on the data that actually appear</p>
<p>524<br>00:52:09,280 –&gt; 00:52:13,280<br>in a transaction record, because the only data really has to appear in this transaction record</p>
<p>525<br>00:52:13,280 –&gt; 00:52:15,680<br>is this name, Blasch the hash of this zone file.</p>
<p>526<br>00:52:19,920 –&gt; 00:52:23,519<br>I said, uh, how again do we find this zone file if you only have the hash?</p>
<p>527<br>00:52:24,320 –&gt; 00:52:29,280<br>Huh, it’s a very good question. We don’t really care. Uh, where it comes from. And so in fact,</p>
<p>528<br>00:52:29,280 –&gt; 00:52:33,519<br>you know, they call this the routing layer, right? This, basically the, you tell the learning writer,</p>
<p>529<br>00:52:33,519 –&gt; 00:52:41,360<br>hey, I’m looking for a file that has the following hash. And then the routing layer, uh, has to produce</p>
<p>530<br>00:52:41,360 –&gt; 00:52:45,920<br>that file and you can check whether you got the right file by recomputing the hash and see if it</p>
<p>531<br>00:52:45,920 –&gt; 00:52:47,679<br>matches the one that you’re asking for.</p>
<p>532<br>00:52:53,599 –&gt; 00:52:59,519<br>Any other questions about this?</p>
<p>533<br>00:53:05,199 –&gt; 00:53:11,360<br>So sorry, just to clarify, um, operations within this file storage or the zone files</p>
<p>534<br>00:53:11,360 –&gt; 00:53:18,719<br>that’s still limited by the underlying blockchain though, right? Uh, yes and no. Uh, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>535<br>00:53:18,879 –&gt; 00:53:27,839<br>Or just like, because modifications or changes to like the file would need it like a new hash and</p>
<p>536<br>00:53:27,839 –&gt; 00:53:33,599<br>therefore a new log entry within the blockchain. So you still have to wait for that to be</p>
<p>537<br>00:53:33,599 –&gt; 00:53:39,279<br>couldn’t co-accepted, which is like an hour, right? Yeah, although absolutely true. So when you</p>
<p>538<br>00:53:39,279 –&gt; 00:53:44,879<br>make a change to the zone file, you know, that, that has to run through the TXN. But for example,</p>
<p>539<br>00:53:44,880 –&gt; 00:53:49,920<br>updating the to-do list, uh, wouldn’t have to require a big conscious action.</p>
<p>540<br>00:53:53,680 –&gt; 00:53:56,960<br>You know, really update the zone file at all, you know, you’re just, you know,</p>
<p>541<br>00:53:56,960 –&gt; 00:54:02,720<br>updating the to-do list file and the zone file only contains the name to do and the URI plus</p>
<p>542<br>00:54:02,720 –&gt; 00:54:11,599<br>the public key, but you’re not updating any of those. I see, but doesn’t, then we store also the hash</p>
<p>543<br>00:54:11,599 –&gt; 00:54:15,839<br>of the file. So if we change the content, that’s, that’s not only, okay, there are two cases for</p>
<p>544<br>00:54:15,839 –&gt; 00:54:22,639<br>the mutable, there’s the mutable storage and the immutable storage. And uh, what they, uh,</p>
<p>545<br>00:54:22,639 –&gt; 00:54:26,319<br>propose is that for immutable storage and like storage that you don’t update, you can actually</p>
<p>546<br>00:54:26,319 –&gt; 00:54:30,239<br>stick the hash of the file in there. Uh, but for mutable storage, you know, that’s just going to see a</p>
<p>547<br>00:54:30,239 –&gt; 00:54:34,000<br>lot of rights, you know, you shouldn’t do that. You should use this scheme.</p>
<p>548<br>00:54:36,880 –&gt; 00:54:41,360<br>I see. And then how’s it possible to validate with mutable storage that you’re getting the right</p>
<p>549<br>00:54:41,360 –&gt; 00:54:46,960<br>data then? Yeah, so the presumably, uh, that’s a very good question. Uh, well, you, you can validate whether</p>
<p>550<br>00:54:46,960 –&gt; 00:54:51,120<br>you actually got data that actually was produced by X because you have to public key for X and you</p>
<p>551<br>00:54:51,120 –&gt; 00:54:56,400<br>can verify whether it actually the signature on the to-do file, indeed, you know, checks out with the</p>
<p>552<br>00:54:56,400 –&gt; 00:55:02,000<br>public key of X. So you least know that X has written it. Uh, you may not know of this most region</p>
<p>553<br>00:55:02,000 –&gt; 00:55:07,120<br>version. And so the papers sort of, uh, doesn’t really talk about these in great detail, but basically</p>
<p>554<br>00:55:07,519 –&gt; 00:55:12,159<br>you probably have to stick version numbers in it. And so you least you can detect rollback,</p>
<p>555<br>00:55:13,199 –&gt; 00:55:19,119<br>but there’s a little bit of a, actually, I don’t know how to, how to actually, uh, you can’t</p>
<p>556<br>00:55:19,119 –&gt; 00:55:24,480<br>really ensure that you actually got the latest version. But so where are the modifications to mutable</p>
<p>557<br>00:55:24,480 –&gt; 00:55:30,400<br>storage coming into? Uh, you have to do file lives here, like in the, like, here’s my to-do file.</p>
<p>558<br>00:55:32,079 –&gt; 00:55:36,239<br>And if an application did my to-do list application wants to update to the to-do file,</p>
<p>559<br>00:55:36,239 –&gt; 00:55:42,799<br>you just go to heaven does it. And, uh, and then signs it, you know, using the public key and sticks it in,</p>
<p>560<br>00:55:43,439 –&gt; 00:55:49,199<br>uh, the, uh, and sticks it in for, uh, for to give you a ride.</p>
<p>561<br>00:55:50,319 –&gt; 00:55:55,919<br>And would that be done through the, the routing layer as well? Because you want to find where</p>
<p>562<br>00:55:55,919 –&gt; 00:56:02,719<br>in the storage? Yeah, so the usual two will retrieve, uh, X’s zone file, correct? And once it has</p>
<p>563<br>00:56:02,719 –&gt; 00:56:09,759<br>X’s zone file, it knows where, uh, the file, the to-do file list because there’s the URI sits in the zone file.</p>
<p>564<br>00:56:12,559 –&gt; 00:56:17,039<br>And so again, and that could retrieve it and, uh, check the signature.</p>
<p>565<br>00:56:18,239 –&gt; 00:56:26,159<br>About the URI order, is it only one URI per, uh, name in the zone file or, um,</p>
<p>566<br>00:56:26,239 –&gt; 00:56:34,399<br>I don’t know, uh, uh, unclear exactly how to work. Uh, I’m sorry, I’m not, you know, I didn’t look, check out the source code and</p>
<p>567<br>00:56:34,399 –&gt; 00:56:37,359<br>like look at the, uh, the form of the zone files.</p>
<p>568<br>00:56:42,480 –&gt; 00:56:49,279<br>Uh, since we’re publishing the public key together with the rest of the data in the zone file,</p>
<p>569<br>00:56:49,280 –&gt; 00:56:57,920<br>doesn’t mean I can just make up a private key, make a matching public key and just stick</p>
<p>570<br>00:56:57,920 –&gt; 00:57:05,920<br>something in there and say, I’m user Z because I’m, because they to provide the public key, so</p>
<p>571<br>00:57:05,920 –&gt; 00:57:13,600<br>can I not just lie? Well, you can’t falsify the zone file, correct? Because the zone file, the hash of</p>
<p>572<br>00:57:13,599 –&gt; 00:57:16,639<br>the zone file must match the hash that sits in the blockchain.</p>
<p>573<br>00:57:23,920 –&gt; 00:57:31,199<br>So only the, uh, person that actually entered the blockchain record mapping x, you know,</p>
<p>574<br>00:57:31,199 –&gt; 00:57:35,599<br>to that hash zone file, only that person could have reduced, you know, that zone file.</p>
<p>575<br>00:57:37,679 –&gt; 00:57:39,279<br>I see. Thank you.</p>
<p>576<br>00:57:44,079 –&gt; 00:57:51,599<br>Okay. Well, so this is basically the big picture and if you got this is the, uh, if you got this part,</p>
<p>577<br>00:57:51,599 –&gt; 00:57:57,519<br>then usually the rest of the sort of details, uh, important, but maybe less important.</p>
<p>578<br>00:57:58,079 –&gt; 00:58:05,360<br>This is the key thing to understand. Okay. Um, I guess a couple things I want to go over,</p>
<p>579<br>00:58:05,360 –&gt; 00:58:08,799<br>particularly I want to talk a little bit more about name creation because there’s a couple</p>
<p>580<br>00:58:08,800 –&gt; 00:58:10,640<br>little details that actually interesting.</p>
<p>581<br>00:58:19,200 –&gt; 00:58:25,200<br>So it turns out the name creation actually has two, uh, parts to it.</p>
<p>582<br>00:58:25,200 –&gt; 00:58:28,720<br>Uh, the first of all, the user needs a half course on the bitcoins because you got to pay.</p>
<p>583<br>00:58:28,719 –&gt; 00:58:42,159<br>The reason you have to have some bitcoins is because you got to convince, uh, one of the,</p>
<p>584<br>00:58:42,159 –&gt; 00:58:46,000<br>uh, miners directly include your transaction in the Bitcoin ledger.</p>
<p>585<br>00:58:46,000 –&gt; 00:58:50,959<br>And so it turns out there are sort of two transactions for every name that you create.</p>
<p>586<br>00:58:50,960 –&gt; 00:58:59,360<br>And one is, uh, basically a pre-order transaction.</p>
<p>587<br>00:59:02,240 –&gt; 00:59:07,039<br>And in the pre-order transaction, you don’t really list the name, but actually the hash of the name.</p>
<p>588<br>00:59:11,760 –&gt; 00:59:15,519<br>So anybody who sees the pre-order transaction doesn’t know what the name is, but, you know,</p>
<p>589<br>00:59:16,079 –&gt; 00:59:17,599<br>doesn’t know what the hash of the name is.</p>
<p>590<br>00:59:18,159 –&gt; 00:59:21,679<br>And then there’s the second transaction we really register the name.</p>
<p>591<br>00:59:24,320 –&gt; 00:59:27,519<br>And if that basically contains the actual name,</p>
<p>592<br>00:59:28,960 –&gt; 00:59:33,119<br>yeah, where for which we first published the hash and the hash of the zone file.</p>
<p>593<br>00:59:33,440 –&gt; 00:59:45,359<br>And, um, so why, why, why is this done?</p>
<p>594<br>00:59:45,359 –&gt; 00:59:47,759<br>And this is actually something that, uh, name coin did.</p>
<p>595<br>00:59:48,400 –&gt; 00:59:49,920<br>Uh, and they adopted it from name coin.</p>
<p>596<br>00:59:49,920 –&gt; 00:59:51,199<br>Yeah, why do it in this way?</p>
<p>597<br>00:59:54,319 –&gt; 00:59:59,199<br>Because if you directly announce the name, then someone else can raise you and, uh,</p>
<p>598<br>00:59:59,199 –&gt; 01:00:02,400<br>try to register that name before you.</p>
<p>599<br>01:00:02,400 –&gt; 01:00:04,000<br>Yeah, this is a common problem.</p>
<p>600<br>01:00:04,000 –&gt; 01:00:05,680<br>It’s called the front-runner problem, right?</p>
<p>601<br>01:00:06,480 –&gt; 01:00:06,800<br>Uh,</p>
<p>602<br>01:00:09,360 –&gt; 01:00:10,559<br>oops, there we go again.</p>
<p>603<br>01:00:10,559 –&gt; 01:00:11,360<br>Sorry.</p>
<p>604<br>01:00:33,360 –&gt; 01:00:37,519<br>So the front-runner problem is exactly described.</p>
<p>605<br>01:00:37,519 –&gt; 01:00:40,400<br>Now, let’s say, you know, you’re trying to register at Google.com.</p>
<p>606<br>01:00:40,960 –&gt; 01:00:43,519<br>And, uh, somebody sees you doing that.</p>
<p>607<br>01:00:43,519 –&gt; 01:00:44,960<br>And of course, you submit it to transaction.</p>
<p>608<br>01:00:44,960 –&gt; 01:00:46,400<br>It’s not in the blockchain yet.</p>
<p>609<br>01:00:46,960 –&gt; 01:00:49,200<br>For example, a minor might actually see you, there were, you know,</p>
<p>610<br>01:00:49,200 –&gt; 01:00:52,559<br>somebody else that actually sits in the, the big point network.</p>
<p>611<br>01:00:52,559 –&gt; 01:00:55,440<br>And just like, oh, hi, I’m going to run ahead and try to get my transaction</p>
<p>612<br>01:00:55,440 –&gt; 01:01:00,800<br>that claiming their, uh, Google.com, uh, into the big point before you.</p>
<p>613<br>01:01:00,880 –&gt; 01:01:03,360<br>And then I own Google.com.</p>
<p>614<br>01:01:03,360 –&gt; 01:01:08,400<br>And so to avoid that problem, uh, you first actually have to enter the hash into the</p>
<p>615<br>01:01:08,400 –&gt; 01:01:15,760<br>Bitcoin chain, uh, then you wait a while to make sure that, uh, that, that record sits in the</p>
<p>616<br>01:01:15,760 –&gt; 01:01:18,160<br>Bitcoin, uh, blockchain, right?</p>
<p>617<br>01:01:18,160 –&gt; 01:01:20,560<br>You have six, whatever, 10 walks.</p>
<p>618<br>01:01:20,560 –&gt; 01:01:24,640<br>And then after that, you sure that like, you know, the sort of, you, the burn the name in the,</p>
<p>619<br>01:01:25,360 –&gt; 01:01:27,280<br>what’s they call in the blockchain.</p>
<p>620<br>01:01:28,080 –&gt; 01:01:30,240<br>That point you actually do the actual registration of the name.</p>
<p>621<br>01:01:31,680 –&gt; 01:01:33,120<br>I got a question regarding that.</p>
<p>622<br>01:01:34,080 –&gt; 01:01:34,240<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>623<br>01:01:35,120 –&gt; 01:01:39,040<br>So what, why is it not possible for an attacker to say,</p>
<p>624<br>01:01:39,040 –&gt; 01:01:41,840<br>pre-comput internally, the hash of Google.com.</p>
<p>625<br>01:01:41,840 –&gt; 01:01:46,080<br>And then look through the blockchain and see if someone posted a hash of Google.</p>
<p>626<br>01:01:46,080 –&gt; 01:01:47,600<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>627<br>01:01:47,600 –&gt; 01:01:50,880<br>So, uh, presumably, you know, there’s a slightly more sophisticated than this,</p>
<p>628<br>01:01:50,880 –&gt; 01:01:52,320<br>you know, just purely the hash.</p>
<p>629<br>01:01:52,320 –&gt; 01:01:54,240<br>There’s presumably a bunch of other arguments that go into it,</p>
<p>630<br>01:01:54,240 –&gt; 01:01:55,360<br>including the nonsense or something.</p>
<p>631<br>01:01:58,240 –&gt; 01:01:59,920<br>Otherwise, you could just make a dictionary, correct?</p>
<p>632<br>01:02:06,720 –&gt; 01:02:10,000<br>And in some ways, this is like really not their adventure, but it’s just, uh,</p>
<p>633<br>01:02:10,000 –&gt; 01:02:12,000<br>you know, as I said before, came out of, uh,</p>
<p>634<br>01:02:13,920 –&gt; 01:02:16,320<br>uh, came out of, uh, uh, name point.</p>
<p>635<br>01:02:22,880 –&gt; 01:02:23,280<br>Okay.</p>
<p>636<br>01:02:23,280 –&gt; 01:02:26,480<br>Um, so let’s, you know, go back to, uh,</p>
<p>637<br>01:02:27,280 –&gt; 01:02:30,160<br>you know, the sort of collaborative apps or, you know, collaborative,</p>
<p>638<br>01:02:35,120 –&gt; 01:02:37,840<br>collaborative, uh, decentralized applications.</p>
<p>639<br>01:02:46,240 –&gt; 01:02:49,920<br>Um, so it would just go back to our to-do list as an example.</p>
<p>640<br>01:02:50,880 –&gt; 01:02:54,240<br>Uh, and just to see, you know, how it really would work, uh, you know,</p>
<p>641<br>01:02:54,240 –&gt; 01:02:56,080<br>sort of sketch out again how it would work.</p>
<p>642<br>01:02:56,719 –&gt; 01:03:00,239<br>Uh, so basically, you know, with two users, correct, you know, running, you know,</p>
<p>643<br>01:03:00,239 –&gt; 01:03:01,279<br>the to-do list app.</p>
<p>644<br>01:03:05,759 –&gt; 01:03:08,000<br>Well, if you won, you know, with YouTube.</p>
<p>645<br>01:03:14,400 –&gt; 01:03:17,279<br>And they basically exchanged, you know, some information with each other.</p>
<p>646<br>01:03:17,279 –&gt; 01:03:21,440<br>They’re basically saying, uh, in some way, your one has learned about YouTube’s name,</p>
<p>647<br>01:03:21,440 –&gt; 01:03:23,279<br>and YouTube has learned about the one’s name.</p>
<p>648<br>01:03:24,160 –&gt; 01:03:27,760<br>And then sort of that, that step, of course, has to happen.</p>
<p>649<br>01:03:27,760 –&gt; 01:03:29,200<br>It has to happen securely.</p>
<p>650<br>01:03:29,200 –&gt; 01:03:33,200<br>And in a sense that you want to really need to know that that actually is YouTube’s name.</p>
<p>651<br>01:03:33,200 –&gt; 01:03:39,360<br>Then they can, YouTube one, or, uh, you want to can look up YouTube’s name.</p>
<p>652<br>01:03:42,800 –&gt; 01:03:44,560<br>You know, get the zone file from that.</p>
<p>653<br>01:03:47,200 –&gt; 01:03:50,880<br>Like, find the entry for say, the to-do list in the zone file.</p>
<p>654<br>01:03:54,240 –&gt; 01:03:57,280<br>Uh, get a zone file also contains, you know, and the public key.</p>
<p>655<br>01:04:00,560 –&gt; 01:04:03,519<br>And it just might be not like, you know, YouTube might have many</p>
<p>656<br>01:04:03,519 –&gt; 01:04:07,920<br>public keys, uh, private keys, uh, because you probably don’t want to have like one master</p>
<p>657<br>01:04:07,920 –&gt; 01:04:11,440<br>private key that you use for everything because you use that one, one master</p>
<p>658<br>01:04:11,440 –&gt; 01:04:13,840<br>private key or somebody still, it’s, you know, you’re in that shape.</p>
<p>659<br>01:04:14,320 –&gt; 01:04:18,080<br>And so typically, I think in the block, in the block stack, there’s sort of a</p>
<p>660<br>01:04:18,080 –&gt; 01:04:19,600<br>public private key per application.</p>
<p>661<br>01:04:20,559 –&gt; 01:04:24,719<br>So, you know, the, you want basically, you can get to has YouTube’s name,</p>
<p>662<br>01:04:24,719 –&gt; 01:04:29,199<br>looks up the zone file, that’s a to-do list, the public key, uh, and the URI.</p>
<p>663<br>01:04:31,360 –&gt; 01:04:37,440<br>You know, through the block stack file system, which attracts away the different storage providers,</p>
<p>664<br>01:04:37,440 –&gt; 01:04:41,839<br>you know, and actually, the retrieves, you know, the actual name, uh, the actual file.</p>
<p>665<br>01:04:43,839 –&gt; 01:04:48,719<br>You know, checks the signal here on the file, maybe version no merge, uh, and, uh, and then,</p>
<p>666<br>01:04:48,719 –&gt; 01:04:54,480<br>basically, use that to construct, you know, the, the, the, to-do list, uh, from YouTube and</p>
<p>667<br>01:04:54,480 –&gt; 01:04:58,319<br>worked out with you once. And similarly, you know, you basically YouTube is the exactly the same</p>
<p>668<br>01:04:58,319 –&gt; 01:05:05,359<br>way I think, you know, and as you once name, and room and goes off, and, uh, you know, retrieves,</p>
<p>669<br>01:05:05,359 –&gt; 01:05:10,959<br>you use one, you, you want to do list, and, you know, that way they can, uh, have a collaborative,</p>
<p>670<br>01:05:12,239 –&gt; 01:05:18,639<br>application. And so, for example, when YouTube updates, uh, it’s file, then, uh, you know,</p>
<p>671<br>01:05:18,639 –&gt; 01:05:23,599<br>periodically, you once ask, you know, uh, go, and retrieve the new, uh,</p>
<p>672<br>01:05:23,599 –&gt; 01:05:26,719<br>retrieve the, the, the to-do list, and just use it in the new updates.</p>
<p>673<br>01:05:30,799 –&gt; 01:05:31,679<br>Does that sort of make sense?</p>
<p>674<br>01:05:34,639 –&gt; 01:05:39,119<br>And you see here, I think there’s like one of these, the central points with the central applications,</p>
<p>675<br>01:05:40,000 –&gt; 01:05:44,960<br>uh, is these applications are building, you know, there’s quite a different way than, uh,</p>
<p>676<br>01:05:44,960 –&gt; 01:05:48,239<br>the ones that we’re talking about very early on, correct? I think we go back to this picture,</p>
<p>677<br>01:05:48,719 –&gt; 01:05:54,960<br>of the centralized, uh, site that we’re building, uh, to-do list application, correct? But in the</p>
<p>678<br>01:05:54,960 –&gt; 01:06:03,759<br>database, yeah, there would be your ones to do list, and you choose to do list,</p>
<p>679<br>01:06:08,559 –&gt; 01:06:12,159<br>and yeah, you know, like the to-do list app, you know, basically, you know,</p>
<p>680<br>01:06:12,159 –&gt; 01:06:16,719<br>retrieve these, uh, the content of these, uh, to-do list, we have the simple SQL SQL query,</p>
<p>681<br>01:06:17,039 –&gt; 01:06:19,519<br>and, you know, push them together and actually present them through the user.</p>
<p>682<br>01:06:20,159 –&gt; 01:06:24,959<br>And we see that like in this decentralized, you know, scheme, you know, it’s quite a lot more mechanism</p>
<p>683<br>01:06:24,959 –&gt; 01:06:29,359<br>involved that actually make this happen, and, uh, in the program, it doesn’t really have to,</p>
<p>684<br>01:06:29,359 –&gt; 01:06:35,839<br>it’s the same, uh, ease of, you know, the SQL interface, as, as in the centralized case.</p>
<p>685<br>01:06:36,799 –&gt; 01:06:42,719<br>So I think this is one of the sort of maybe the sticking points of these decentralized applications,</p>
<p>686<br>01:06:42,719 –&gt; 01:06:46,239<br>I’ll clearly make them as easy to write as sort of decentralized versions.</p>
<p>687<br>01:06:52,480 –&gt; 01:06:55,679<br>Okay, so I want to leave some time this time around, instead of being breakout rooms,</p>
<p>688<br>01:06:56,239 –&gt; 01:07:00,399<br>maybe there’s a leave some time around, time for, just questions or discussion,</p>
<p>689<br>01:07:00,399 –&gt; 01:07:03,839<br>but since this is a little bit more of a, uh, yeah, I’m sort of, you know,</p>
<p>690<br>01:07:03,839 –&gt; 01:07:10,079<br>far-provoking type exercise than, uh, an exercise in, well, years are, how technical problem</p>
<p>691<br>01:07:10,079 –&gt; 01:07:13,119<br>here’s the right solution, you know, there’s learned a right solution and then use it.</p>
<p>692<br>01:07:14,000 –&gt; 01:07:19,599<br>And so, uh, you know, just what they’re hearing, you know, people’s opinion or questions about,</p>
<p>693<br>01:07:19,599 –&gt; 01:07:24,799<br>sort of any aspect of these decentralized applications for centralized, or the particular</p>
<p>694<br>01:07:24,799 –&gt; 01:07:29,119<br>design for block stack or any other issue, and we can debate it together.</p>
<p>695<br>01:07:32,239 –&gt; 01:07:39,679<br>Wait, so what’s the, um, the main difficulty in, um, instead of using like a file system API to</p>
<p>696<br>01:07:39,679 –&gt; 01:07:45,679<br>use like a relational database? Well, how do you write a, how do you present the world-wide,</p>
<p>697<br>01:07:46,879 –&gt; 01:07:52,960<br>relational database? I think all these user files, all these files from the different users,</p>
<p>698<br>01:07:52,960 –&gt; 01:07:59,440<br>leaving all kinds of different, uh, storage providers, um, and, uh, you know, you can’t like</p>
<p>699<br>01:07:59,440 –&gt; 01:08:05,759<br>room, do whatever, uh, you can’t do a select across all the storage providers, bring them to crazy.</p>
<p>700<br>01:08:05,760 –&gt; 01:08:12,160<br>You couldn’t also download all the users data to your computer because that would be too expensive.</p>
<p>701<br>01:08:12,160 –&gt; 01:08:21,520<br>What about like, uh, like, uh, like a link data, um, data database? Yeah, yeah, so I think this is like,</p>
<p>702<br>01:08:21,520 –&gt; 01:08:26,320<br>uh, you know, you’re interested in this, you know, I think there’s renouncing research direction</p>
<p>703<br>01:08:26,320 –&gt; 01:08:31,360<br>to the sort of pursuit, correct, but you could actually build, uh, sort of, uh, uh,</p>
<p>704<br>01:08:31,519 –&gt; 01:08:36,079<br>scalable database infrastructure, uh, where users still control their own data, have the different</p>
<p>705<br>01:08:36,079 –&gt; 01:08:39,519<br>locations, yeah, then they’re gonna provide a sort of a relational data type interface.</p>
<p>706<br>01:08:41,279 –&gt; 01:08:43,439<br>Certainly blocks out, blocks out, there’s no arferies in you.</p>
<p>707<br>01:08:48,159 –&gt; 01:08:53,519<br>I guess another question is, um, like, what are the benefits of this decentralized PKI versus like,</p>
<p>708<br>01:08:54,239 –&gt; 01:08:59,519<br>web of trust PKI, which I guess is also decentralized? Yeah, so, so, so, totally other, you know,</p>
<p>709<br>01:08:59,520 –&gt; 01:09:05,200<br>I guess, uh, yeah, maybe you should point to here, correct. Uh, you know, there’s sort of the,</p>
<p>710<br>01:09:05,200 –&gt; 01:09:07,920<br>there are other web of trust API, web of trust.</p>
<p>711<br>01:09:11,680 –&gt; 01:09:18,080<br>PKI’s, uh, you know, one of the most familiar with is, uh, is, uh,</p>
<p>712<br>01:09:18,720 –&gt; 01:09:21,119<br>uh, uh, keybase.</p>
<p>713<br>01:09:24,960 –&gt; 01:09:28,720<br>I think we’ve mentioned a couple of times before, uh, and, uh, I, you know,</p>
<p>714<br>01:09:28,720 –&gt; 01:09:33,279<br>I, uh, keybase actually, uh, we haven’t talked about this in a great detail, but, uh,</p>
<p>715<br>01:09:33,279 –&gt; 01:09:37,039<br>one of the things that I was also challenging these kinds of systems is like, how do you represent</p>
<p>716<br>01:09:37,039 –&gt; 01:09:41,680<br>groups of users? Like, we should have a little bit in the Sunderpaper, uh, where, you know,</p>
<p>717<br>01:09:41,680 –&gt; 01:09:45,039<br>we have group names, you know, all the keys for the group names and, you know, how to create them,</p>
<p>718<br>01:09:45,039 –&gt; 01:09:48,960<br>and I’ll manage them and actually, you know, stick them in, you know, how do you incorporate those in,</p>
<p>719<br>01:09:49,760 –&gt; 01:09:55,039<br>uh, in the, the chain of records name records, uh, and keybase, that’s a really, really, really,</p>
<p>720<br>01:09:55,039 –&gt; 01:10:00,399<br>a really thought out story for that. Uh, and, you know, actually, it’s a very impressive, it’s</p>
<p>721<br>01:10:00,399 –&gt; 01:10:06,159<br>probably, you know, the sort of, uh, probably, uh, probably consider it the, sort of the best sort of</p>
<p>722<br>01:10:06,159 –&gt; 01:10:11,439<br>decentralized, you know, PKI out there. And the most thought out is probably most widely used.</p>
<p>723<br>01:10:15,519 –&gt; 01:10:23,039<br>So, other, any benefits of doing it of like block stacks method, or is it just more extensible?</p>
<p>724<br>01:10:23,920 –&gt; 01:10:28,159<br>Well, one of the things that actually you block stack gets correct is, uh, it’s this uniqueness,</p>
<p>725<br>01:10:28,880 –&gt; 01:10:32,960<br>properties because the web of trust, there’s basically not a global naming system, you know,</p>
<p>726<br>01:10:32,960 –&gt; 01:10:39,760<br>like, you know, it is like my to do list or my contact list, uh, and, you know, whatever, who I name,</p>
<p>727<br>01:10:40,560 –&gt; 01:10:46,480<br>if I have a name, John for some particular public key, that is my John. And, uh, if I send John</p>
<p>728<br>01:10:46,480 –&gt; 01:10:50,560<br>to you, it’s like a text, you know, stringed John, and it probably resolves differently,</p>
<p>729<br>01:10:50,560 –&gt; 01:10:58,320<br>differently in your, uh, contact list than in mine. So, in fact, uh, so keybase is much more, uh,</p>
<p>730<br>01:10:58,320 –&gt; 01:11:02,800<br>is decentralized, uh, but there is definitely really go for the sort of global unique names.</p>
<p>731<br>01:11:03,920 –&gt; 01:11:09,199<br>Now, it is the case that, you know, keybase once in a while publishes the hash of all the names,</p>
<p>732<br>01:11:09,920 –&gt; 01:11:14,159<br>of the complete, the miracle tree of all names in, in, in the blockchain too.</p>
<p>733<br>01:11:15,199 –&gt; 01:11:18,640<br>So you can sort of verify whether keybase actually is not playing in games,</p>
<p>734<br>01:11:20,320 –&gt; 01:11:24,400<br>but, you know, the, uh, it’s a much more, it doesn’t really have global unique dates.</p>
<p>735<br>01:11:30,000 –&gt; 01:11:34,320<br>Sorry, just the clarification question. Earlier on in the lecture, you mentioned how</p>
<p>736<br>01:11:34,880 –&gt; 01:11:38,960<br>users have the, basically they can choose who to show their data to,</p>
<p>737<br>01:11:39,359 –&gt; 01:11:46,159<br>yeah, um, or who they give access to their data to, um, but I’m not quite sure I see how</p>
<p>738<br>01:11:46,159 –&gt; 01:11:52,479<br>that’s implemented within that system. Yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>739<br>01:11:52,479 –&gt; 01:11:56,159<br>the way one way to do it in, uh, I don’t know which actually, you know, what the, what the</p>
<p>740<br>01:11:56,159 –&gt; 01:12:02,000<br>blockchain does is that you encrypt the same data, uh, for different users. So I think, uh,</p>
<p>741<br>01:12:02,000 –&gt; 01:12:09,439<br>you want to, uh, share your data only with user one user two, uh, then, uh, you’re encrypted,</p>
<p>742<br>01:12:09,439 –&gt; 01:12:14,720<br>you know, with the, uh, public keys of user one user two, and then those are the only two that can</p>
<p>743<br>01:12:14,720 –&gt; 01:12:20,639<br>decrypt it. And so that gives you sort of extra control lists.</p>
<p>744<br>01:12:20,640 –&gt; 01:12:31,200<br>I see. So you’d have to, for each person you wanted to give the data to, you’d have to encrypt it</p>
<p>745<br>01:12:31,200 –&gt; 01:12:36,480<br>with like their public key. Yeah. And you can get more sophisticated about this, you know,</p>
<p>746<br>01:12:36,480 –&gt; 01:12:41,680<br>you can actually have group keys, and, you know, give, uh, group of users, you know, access to,</p>
<p>747<br>01:12:41,680 –&gt; 01:12:48,240<br>you know, you have a lockbox that, uh, has a group key in it and you, uh, encrypt the lockbox with</p>
<p>748<br>01:12:48,399 –&gt; 01:12:53,039<br>the different users, you know, public keys, and then they get access to that lockbox, they get the</p>
<p>749<br>01:12:53,039 –&gt; 01:12:58,000<br>key out of it, and then they can decrypt the key. So you only have to encrypt the data only once</p>
<p>750<br>01:12:58,000 –&gt; 01:13:03,359<br>instead of multiple times. And you only have to encrypt the, encrypt the lockbox multiple times.</p>
<p>751<br>01:13:04,559 –&gt; 01:13:05,039<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>752<br>01:13:08,079 –&gt; 01:13:12,800<br>Um, that would be done at the level of the content of this zone file, right?</p>
<p>753<br>01:13:13,760 –&gt; 01:13:19,119<br>Uh, yeah, we’ve really, uh, we’re, or maybe the key that is in the zone files will be the key for</p>
<p>754<br>01:13:19,119 –&gt; 01:13:25,360<br>the lockbox if you will. And again, I’m not actually 100% sure exactly how, uh,</p>
<p>755<br>01:13:27,199 –&gt; 01:13:27,440<br>uh,</p>
<p>756<br>01:13:30,480 –&gt; 01:13:35,039<br>how well blocksec actually, uh, the, the blocksec file system does, uh, action control, when it does it</p>
<p>757<br>01:13:35,039 –&gt; 01:13:39,760<br>all. But other people have done these kinds of designs.</p>
<p>758<br>01:13:39,920 –&gt; 01:13:46,960<br>Do you think, uh, systems like this be able to compete with like the centralized model in terms of</p>
<p>759<br>01:13:46,960 –&gt; 01:13:52,960<br>performance or scalability? And what would it take? I don’t know. These are, uh, good,</p>
<p>760<br>01:13:54,320 –&gt; 01:13:58,720<br>good questions. Uh, I don’t know really no, the answer. At least the case, correct? Like even</p>
<p>761<br>01:13:58,720 –&gt; 01:14:02,720<br>the centralized side is not that easy to scale. You know, we’ve written, written quite a number of</p>
<p>762<br>01:14:02,720 –&gt; 01:14:08,640<br>pavers, right? You should have seen how, uh, how to make them, uh, scalable to millions of users.</p>
<p>763<br>01:14:10,000 –&gt; 01:14:10,720<br>And so, you know,</p>
<p>764<br>01:14:12,960 –&gt; 01:14:16,960<br>hope, uh, yeah, we’re just getting anything to a large, large number of users is not easy.</p>
<p>765<br>01:14:17,920 –&gt; 01:14:24,079<br>Uh, and, uh, certainly, uh, in the case of the decentralized apps, it’s not going to be easy to,</p>
<p>766<br>01:14:24,079 –&gt; 01:14:29,119<br>but the other hand, like if there’s not wide sharing, like the user one actually, I only have a share</p>
<p>767<br>01:14:29,119 –&gt; 01:14:32,560<br>to do is the 10 other users. I’m not sure if it’ll probably not be a big issue,</p>
<p>768<br>01:14:32,560 –&gt; 01:14:36,159<br>correct? Some ways you can think about the decentralized arduous architecture is basically</p>
<p>769<br>01:14:36,239 –&gt; 01:14:47,359<br>sharded by user. And each app, you know, runs in one of users’ computers. So, you know, you don’t need</p>
<p>770<br>01:14:47,359 –&gt; 01:14:59,119<br>to like data standards of cash. So, I don’t know what the answer to that question actually is.</p>
<p>771<br>01:15:00,880 –&gt; 01:15:02,559<br>I’m not be able to give you a different answer.</p>
<p>772<br>01:15:07,039 –&gt; 01:15:10,479<br>It’s clearly case that, you know, people have demonstrated a bigger scalability with sort of these,</p>
<p>773<br>01:15:12,720 –&gt; 01:15:17,199<br>uh, centralized designs, uh, at least so far we’ve seen then in the decentralized ones, but,</p>
<p>774<br>01:15:17,199 –&gt; 01:15:22,319<br>you know, one reason of that, of course, is that the, the, the centralized designs are like the,</p>
<p>775<br>01:15:22,319 –&gt; 01:15:26,639<br>the widely used and most popular, uh, the most deployed, uh, cases.</p>
<p>776<br>01:15:28,399 –&gt; 01:15:34,720<br>I think the, the, the, the, the decentralized design is just intriguing design. And, uh,</p>
<p>777<br>01:15:34,720 –&gt; 01:15:37,119<br>that if it could make it to be work, you know, it would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>778<br>01:15:45,920 –&gt; 01:15:47,920<br>And the other thoughts that people might have for,</p>
<p>779<br>01:15:51,760 –&gt; 01:15:52,800<br>would like to argue about.</p>
<p>780<br>01:15:52,800 –&gt; 01:16:08,000<br>I still feel like the storage aspect is like the thing that, that William Lowe was pointing out,</p>
<p>781<br>01:16:08,000 –&gt; 01:16:14,960<br>where like you maybe have an immutable file that’s the, the user information, but the mutable file</p>
<p>782<br>01:16:15,039 –&gt; 01:16:24,319<br>that you have somewhere else is like a, a huge problem, um, in so much that like I, I don’t really</p>
<p>783<br>01:16:24,319 –&gt; 01:16:32,640<br>understand how you can assure redundancy for the, uh, large amount of mutable storage that</p>
<p>784<br>01:16:32,640 –&gt; 01:16:36,880<br>you might have. Yeah, I think the, I think the, the, the, the, the, I think the answer to the</p>
<p>785<br>01:16:36,880 –&gt; 01:16:42,239<br>redundancy may be not that tough. Uh, I think the user is responsible for redundancy. Uh, so you’ve</p>
<p>786<br>01:16:42,239 –&gt; 01:16:46,719<br>utilized your, you’re, you’re to do this, you own it to do this file and you’re dropped to</p>
<p>787<br>01:16:46,719 –&gt; 01:16:51,599<br>replicate it, you know, multiple times. So the block stack storage servers do that for you,</p>
<p>788<br>01:16:52,239 –&gt; 01:16:58,800<br>but you got to range, you know, basically for, uh, space and the different storage providers to, uh,</p>
<p>789<br>01:17:00,000 –&gt; 01:17:05,199<br>do that. And so I think in the paper to talk about, like, oh, you replicated it, maybe, uh,</p>
<p>790<br>01:17:05,199 –&gt; 01:17:10,159<br>Google Drive and the desk read. And presumably, the screen internally does its own replication,</p>
<p>791<br>01:17:10,159 –&gt; 01:17:13,199<br>right? So hopefully, you know, maybe you just actually stored only at that screen. That should</p>
<p>792<br>01:17:13,199 –&gt; 01:17:17,920<br>be pretty reliable. Probably more reliable than storing data on your SSD and your laptop.</p>
<p>793<br>01:17:22,000 –&gt; 01:17:26,639<br>And the zone files are small. So they’re just whitely replicated and you don’t have to trust</p>
<p>794<br>01:17:26,639 –&gt; 01:17:28,559<br>the, uh, the storage provider.</p>
<p>795<br>01:17:40,159 –&gt; 01:18:02,079<br>And the other thought. I was thinking it’s a little bit wasteful that you have in order to register</p>
<p>796<br>01:18:02,079 –&gt; 01:18:10,399<br>a name and to use this name system, you have to pay. Um, yeah. So I was thinking, obviously on a,</p>
<p>797<br>01:18:10,399 –&gt; 01:18:16,800<br>in a blockchain based system, you have to incentivize the miners, but I was, maybe there’s a different</p>
<p>798<br>01:18:17,519 –&gt; 01:18:26,079<br>cheaper way. I don’t know. Yeah, I’m not sure. It seems in some ways that, that sort of the currency and</p>
<p>799<br>01:18:26,079 –&gt; 01:18:31,439<br>this sort of, uh, very coupled. I said, a reason, exactly for the reason that you mentioned,</p>
<p>800<br>01:18:31,439 –&gt; 01:18:36,079<br>because you don’t have miners and you have to incentivize them. Now, I think in general, like,</p>
<p>801<br>01:18:36,079 –&gt; 01:18:39,199<br>with these transactions, they’re pretty cheap, you know, basically, you know, basically you have to</p>
<p>802<br>01:18:39,199 –&gt; 01:18:43,199<br>just pay enough, correct, that the miners is just willing to do the transaction, include your transaction.</p>
<p>803<br>01:18:44,319 –&gt; 01:18:49,839<br>Uh, and you know, today you also pay for, you know, if you want to register a name in, you know,</p>
<p>804<br>01:18:50,639 –&gt; 01:18:54,799<br>in DNS, you know, you actually pay quite a bit of money. Stop free.</p>
<p>805<br>01:18:54,800 –&gt; 01:19:03,840<br>I don’t know exactly how the economics would work out, but, uh, it’s not, obviously, clear that</p>
<p>806<br>01:19:03,840 –&gt; 01:19:07,440<br>this is actually more expensive way of doing it, other than maybe, you know, you’re burning the planet</p>
<p>807<br>01:19:07,440 –&gt; 01:19:14,000<br>within electricity. Uh, it leads into Bitcoin case, but maybe you should use, uh, one of these</p>
<p>808<br>01:19:14,000 –&gt; 01:19:24,000<br>state of work, uh, ledger should step up the, uh, which I, uh, uh, approve state,</p>
<p>809<br>01:19:24,000 –&gt; 01:19:26,319<br>instead of these, we have proof of work, uh, ledger should.</p>
<p>810<br>01:19:29,920 –&gt; 01:19:34,640<br>It’ll be possible just to swap it out in place of where one.</p>
<p>811<br>01:19:34,640 –&gt; 01:19:38,079<br>Yeah, I think this is like, I think this is what the papers argue, correct? Like, their particular</p>
<p>812<br>01:19:38,079 –&gt; 01:19:43,359<br>designs really not very dependent on the, uh, on the line of watching, and they could easily switch</p>
<p>813<br>01:19:43,439 –&gt; 01:19:46,799<br>to another blockchain. And in fact, you know, this is the second blockchain that worked on, correct?</p>
<p>814<br>01:19:46,799 –&gt; 01:19:50,799<br>That first year’s name coin, and then they switched to Bitcoin. And I think the argument</p>
<p>815<br>01:19:50,799 –&gt; 01:19:57,839<br>into the paper’s making on we could actually switch to another one, uh, uh, blockchain we wanted to.</p>
<p>816<br>01:19:57,840 –&gt; 01:20:12,400<br>What in particular is stored in the name history?</p>
<p>817<br>01:20:12,400 –&gt; 01:20:19,600<br>In the, uh, sorry, what, uh, what’s the question, uh, really?</p>
<p>818<br>01:20:19,600 –&gt; 01:20:22,960<br>Oh, sorry, the name history in the block stack database.</p>
<p>819<br>01:20:22,960 –&gt; 01:20:27,279<br>Yeah, this, this, uh, yeah, I don’t really mean like these three different guys.</p>
<p>820<br>01:20:28,079 –&gt; 01:20:30,000<br>Yeah, different version of the zone file.</p>
<p>821<br>01:20:31,759 –&gt; 01:20:34,319<br>Oh, so they’re just like version numbers?</p>
<p>822<br>01:20:34,319 –&gt; 01:20:37,599<br>Yeah, I think so. I’m not sure 100% sure about that.</p>
<p>823<br>01:20:38,479 –&gt; 01:20:41,519<br>But like these correspond to the free updates to the zone file, correct?</p>
<p>824<br>01:20:41,519 –&gt; 01:20:42,960<br>Here’s number one, here’s number two.</p>
<p>825<br>01:20:45,279 –&gt; 01:20:47,519<br>And maybe they keep using versions of the zone file around.</p>
<p>826<br>01:20:57,759 –&gt; 01:21:03,279<br>Any other topics that people want to bring up?</p>
<p>827<br>01:21:09,279 –&gt; 01:21:11,679<br>Okay, so we’re in sort of in election time anyway.</p>
<p>828<br>01:21:11,679 –&gt; 01:21:13,199<br>Okay, so let’s say I want to restock here.</p>
<p>829<br>01:21:13,199 –&gt; 01:21:15,679<br>So people in the, uh, need to leave can leave.</p>
<p>830<br>01:21:15,679 –&gt; 01:21:19,599<br>Uh, and I’ll see you hopefully everybody on first day.</p>
<p>831<br>01:21:19,599 –&gt; 01:21:21,759<br>Yeah, we’re going to see, uh, eight.</p>
<p>832<br>01:21:21,759 –&gt; 01:21:24,000<br>We had eight design, uh, eight projects.</p>
<p>833<br>01:21:24,479 –&gt; 01:21:27,439<br>And so the eight teams will present the first day.</p>
<p>834<br>01:21:27,439 –&gt; 01:21:32,079<br>What they’ve done instead of lap, uh, lap four.</p>
<p>835<br>01:21:32,079 –&gt; 01:21:35,680<br>And it should be, and the, the project quite cool and interesting.</p>
<p>836<br>01:21:35,680 –&gt; 01:21:38,319<br>So hopefully it’ll be in, uh, it will be entertained.</p>
<p>837<br>01:21:39,199 –&gt; 01:21:41,359<br>And that makes sure it includes this lecture.</p>
<p>838<br>01:21:41,359 –&gt; 01:21:45,760<br>Hopefully, uh, after a bit of a goal was a little bit before performing.</p>
<p>839<br>01:21:45,760 –&gt; 01:21:49,920<br>And you know, sort of talk about, uh, designs, uh,</p>
<p>840<br>01:21:49,920 –&gt; 01:21:53,119<br>decentralized designs that have this nice property that the users own.</p>
<p>841<br>01:21:53,119 –&gt; 01:21:57,680<br>Their data and, uh, you know, and we looked in the context of, uh,</p>
<p>842<br>01:21:57,680 –&gt; 01:22:00,000<br>block stack at least one particular design.</p>
<p>843<br>01:22:00,640 –&gt; 01:22:03,039<br>Uh, how they, uh, did naming in a way that, uh,</p>
<p>844<br>01:22:03,039 –&gt; 01:22:07,279<br>gives global names, unique names, and human, uh, readable.</p>
<p>845<br>01:22:08,000 –&gt; 01:22:10,159<br>Okay, so that’s the end of this lecture.</p>
<p>846<br>01:22:10,159 –&gt; 01:22:12,159<br>And hopefully we’ll see you on first day,</p>
<p>847<br>01:22:12,159 –&gt; 01:22:13,680<br>which is going to be our final class meeting.</p>
<p>848<br>01:22:18,239 –&gt; 01:22:21,039<br>And if you have any questions, you can please feel free to stick around.</p>
<p>849<br>01:22:21,119 –&gt; 01:22:23,039<br>And we can talk.</p>
<p>850<br>01:22:23,039 –&gt; 01:22:25,439<br>Um, um, Professor,</p>
<p>851<br>01:22:25,439 –&gt; 01:22:28,399<br>I’m really, uh, for the presentation, um,</p>
<p>852<br>01:22:28,399 –&gt; 01:22:32,720<br>are we, are we supposed to do something more of a demo or should we have, like,</p>
<p>853<br>01:22:32,720 –&gt; 01:22:34,640<br>slides prepared or combination both?</p>
<p>854<br>01:22:34,640 –&gt; 01:22:36,800<br>Yeah, we put, uh, but we put a bunch of some instructions.</p>
<p>855<br>01:22:36,800 –&gt; 01:22:41,519<br>Uh, in, um, uh, the down side is, you just get past some more.</p>
<p>856<br>01:22:41,519 –&gt; 01:22:44,479<br>Yeah, sir. Uh, you’re pretty, free to do, Shell.</p>
<p>857<br>01:22:44,479 –&gt; 01:22:47,600<br>What you want to do, uh, you know, the thing you want to do is, uh,</p>
<p>858<br>01:22:47,600 –&gt; 01:22:50,640<br>convince the class and not, you know, uh,</p>
<p>859<br>01:22:50,720 –&gt; 01:22:52,240<br>what project you did in my school.</p>
<p>860<br>01:22:53,200 –&gt; 01:22:54,560<br>Uh, so demos are a good idea.</p>
<p>861<br>01:22:55,039 –&gt; 01:22:57,119<br>Uh, you don’t have a ton of time.</p>
<p>862<br>01:22:57,119 –&gt; 01:23:00,560<br>So I think the typical thing to do is, uh, people have a few slides,</p>
<p>863<br>01:23:00,560 –&gt; 01:23:03,119<br>they’re explaining what they did, and then maybe, uh,</p>
<p>864<br>01:23:03,119 –&gt; 01:23:05,680<br>cook demos to see how it actually materialized.</p>
<p>865<br>01:23:06,960 –&gt; 01:23:08,720<br>Great. Okay. Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p>866<br>01:23:11,680 –&gt; 01:23:15,039<br>Yeah, we don’t expect you to do whatever in hours who prepare for this, correct?</p>
<p>867<br>01:23:15,920 –&gt; 01:23:17,920<br>Uh, do we, you know, try to share what you’ve done?</p>
<p>868<br>01:23:20,640 –&gt; 01:23:23,520<br>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>869<br>01:23:26,160 –&gt; 01:23:30,000<br>I just wanted to ask, so it’s, like, what is the</p>
<p>870<br>01:23:31,200 –&gt; 01:23:38,320<br>reasoning behind just having, just using the same Bitcoin, like, the blockchain,</p>
<p>871<br>01:23:39,119 –&gt; 01:23:44,079<br>and just putting the, the transactions for the naming on there,</p>
<p>872<br>01:23:44,800 –&gt; 01:23:47,360<br>together with all the rest of the things, right?</p>
<p>873<br>01:23:47,360 –&gt; 01:23:47,600<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>874<br>01:23:48,560 –&gt; 01:23:50,560<br>I think there’s the papers, uh,</p>
<p>875<br>01:23:52,240 –&gt; 01:23:55,920<br>so they started out, they started out building a top of name coin,</p>
<p>876<br>01:23:56,480 –&gt; 01:23:58,640<br>which is a special purpose ledger for naming.</p>
<p>877<br>01:23:59,280 –&gt; 01:24:03,039<br>Um, and they discovered it basically, uh,</p>
<p>878<br>01:24:04,320 –&gt; 01:24:07,440<br>we should have all kinds of security issues with, uh, name coin,</p>
<p>879<br>01:24:08,480 –&gt; 01:24:11,200<br>and one of them being, uh, they are actually not many miners.</p>
<p>880<br>01:24:12,240 –&gt; 01:24:16,000<br>And so, uh, they observed that they are basically, uh,</p>
<p>881<br>01:24:16,640 –&gt; 01:24:22,159<br>minor pools that basically have more than 50% of the, uh, capacity</p>
<p>882<br>01:24:23,199 –&gt; 01:24:24,880<br>and, uh, work capacity.</p>
<p>883<br>01:24:24,880 –&gt; 01:24:27,600<br>And therefore, you know, could do anything they wanted to do to the, uh,</p>
<p>884<br>01:24:27,600 –&gt; 01:24:28,640<br>to the principle to the lecture.</p>
<p>885<br>01:24:29,680 –&gt; 01:24:30,960<br>And so they wanted to sit on, uh,</p>
<p>886<br>01:24:31,840 –&gt; 01:24:36,640<br>uh, a blockchain that is widely used, very popular and not easy to overtake, uh, by the adversary.</p>
<p>887<br>01:24:38,560 –&gt; 01:24:40,960<br>Okay. I remember they said 21%.</p>
<p>888<br>01:24:40,960 –&gt; 01:24:42,000<br>Yeah. I remember.</p>
<p>889<br>01:24:42,960 –&gt; 01:24:43,439<br>Okay.</p>
<p>890<br>01:24:43,519 –&gt; 01:24:44,079<br>It makes sense.</p>
<p>891<br>01:24:45,039 –&gt; 01:24:47,599<br>And I also wanted to ask about, um,</p>
<p>892<br>01:24:48,559 –&gt; 01:24:50,399<br>the your rights, their your rights to,</p>
<p>893<br>01:24:51,599 –&gt; 01:24:56,399<br>do the zone file storage system, they’re not just like, um,</p>
<p>894<br>01:24:56,399 –&gt; 01:24:58,159<br>S3 something, something, right?</p>
<p>895<br>01:24:58,159 –&gt; 01:24:58,799<br>Yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>896<br>01:24:59,279 –&gt; 01:25:02,079<br>Uh, the brownie was something a little bit more general because it’s actually</p>
<p>897<br>01:25:02,079 –&gt; 01:25:06,239<br>interpreted by the, uh, uh, by the block stack file system.</p>
<p>898<br>01:25:06,879 –&gt; 01:25:12,079<br>Uh, uh, so, and the block of the stack file system has back ends for the different storage provider,</p>
<p>899<br>01:25:12,079 –&gt; 01:25:14,720<br>where it’s S3 or Google Drive or whatever.</p>
<p>900<br>01:25:15,760 –&gt; 01:25:18,319<br>And so there’s some naming scheme that, uh,</p>
<p>901<br>01:25:18,319 –&gt; 01:25:23,359<br>that, that, that, that, uh, the block stack file system can interpret and then figure out</p>
<p>902<br>01:25:23,359 –&gt; 01:25:28,880<br>how to retrieve the right file from the, uh, the correct, uh, back end.</p>
<p>903<br>01:25:31,119 –&gt; 01:25:33,600<br>This is just to make them the same.</p>
<p>904<br>01:25:33,600 –&gt; 01:25:34,000<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>905<br>01:25:34,000 –&gt; 01:25:36,319<br>Exactly. Usually like an application writer doesn’t really want to,</p>
<p>906<br>01:25:36,319 –&gt; 01:25:37,199<br>doesn’t want to care.</p>
<p>907<br>01:25:37,199 –&gt; 01:25:37,439<br>Correct.</p>
<p>908<br>01:25:37,439 –&gt; 01:25:39,119<br>Whether it’s stored at S3 or Google Drive,</p>
<p>909<br>01:25:39,119 –&gt; 01:25:40,079<br>we shouldn’t be aware.</p>
<p>910<br>01:25:40,079 –&gt; 01:25:41,600<br>There’s usually you have to deal with that.</p>
<p>911<br>01:25:43,039 –&gt; 01:25:43,519<br>All right.</p>
<p>912<br>01:25:43,519 –&gt; 01:25:44,559<br>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>913<br>01:25:44,559 –&gt; 01:25:45,119<br>You’re welcome.</p>
<p>914<br>01:25:47,359 –&gt; 01:25:51,600<br>I had a question about why Zucos Triangle is kind of like,</p>
<p>915<br>01:25:52,880 –&gt; 01:25:54,239<br>I think that people think about a lot.</p>
<p>916<br>01:25:54,239 –&gt; 01:25:57,519<br>Like it seems like you can have like a client side like interpret the human,</p>
<p>917<br>01:25:58,319 –&gt; 01:26:02,239<br>uh, non-meaningful data that you can make kind of all the data human-meaningful,</p>
<p>918<br>01:26:02,239 –&gt; 01:26:04,239<br>like on the client side to the, to the user.</p>
<p>919<br>01:26:04,880 –&gt; 01:26:07,680<br>Um, and so I wasn’t completely sure like what,</p>
<p>920<br>01:26:08,640 –&gt; 01:26:12,079<br>like what the innovation here is or why like people,</p>
<p>921<br>01:26:12,720 –&gt; 01:26:14,400<br>why this is necessarily like a trade-off.</p>
<p>922<br>01:26:15,680 –&gt; 01:26:16,000<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>923<br>01:26:16,000 –&gt; 01:26:16,480<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>924<br>01:26:16,480 –&gt; 01:26:18,960<br>Well, I just, this is the best slide I can give you.</p>
<p>925<br>01:26:18,960 –&gt; 01:26:21,520<br>We’re, I can give you a whole bunch of naming examples that basically have</p>
<p>926<br>01:26:21,520 –&gt; 01:26:22,720<br>200 free, but not all free.</p>
<p>927<br>01:26:23,680 –&gt; 01:26:27,440<br>And, uh, and sort of example like, you know, uh,</p>
<p>928<br>01:26:28,960 –&gt; 01:26:29,680<br>the, uh,</p>
<p>929<br>01:26:30,720 –&gt; 01:26:32,320<br>you know, we talked about key base, great.</p>
<p>930<br>01:26:32,320 –&gt; 01:26:34,079<br>There’s decent like, you know, decentralized,</p>
<p>931<br>01:26:34,960 –&gt; 01:26:36,240<br>uh, humanly, you’re open, not unique.</p>
<p>932<br>01:26:38,000 –&gt; 01:26:41,840<br>Uh, and now you’re going to argue when it’s that important to have global unique things.</p>
<p>933<br>01:26:42,640 –&gt; 01:26:44,880<br>I get it’s like, you know, whatever you got some global unique game like</p>
<p>934<br>01:26:44,880 –&gt; 01:26:45,840<br>8, 6, 8, 2, 4.</p>
<p>935<br>01:26:45,840 –&gt; 01:26:46,079<br>Yeah.</p>
<p>936<br>01:26:46,079 –&gt; 01:26:46,640<br>What does it mean?</p>
<p>937<br>01:26:47,680 –&gt; 01:26:49,119<br>And who’s associated with it?</p>
<p>938<br>01:26:49,119 –&gt; 01:26:51,840<br>So if you’re coming from that angle, I think that’s a very valid question.</p>
<p>939<br>01:27:00,079 –&gt; 01:27:04,640<br>So one of the things that has always kind of bothered me when we’re reading through these</p>
<p>940<br>01:27:04,720 –&gt; 01:27:11,360<br>blockchain type of papers is like what happens in 100 years when the, the, the ledger gets to like</p>
<p>941<br>01:27:11,360 –&gt; 01:27:15,039<br>multiple tar, I don’t know if it, yeah, like the multiple terabytes or something.</p>
<p>942<br>01:27:18,400 –&gt; 01:27:19,039<br>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>943<br>01:27:19,039 –&gt; 01:27:21,200<br>You’re just like not, we’re not having this scape plan.</p>
<p>944<br>01:27:21,200 –&gt; 01:27:22,560<br>Like what’s going to happen then?</p>
<p>945<br>01:27:23,680 –&gt; 01:27:25,039<br>Uh, I don’t know.</p>
<p>946<br>01:27:26,480 –&gt; 01:27:30,320<br>Part two, uh, speculating on the user out into the future.</p>
<p>947<br>01:27:30,880 –&gt; 01:27:35,759<br>I presume what you could do is like, you know, put a checkpoint in the, uh, uh, yeah, I get</p>
<p>948<br>01:27:35,759 –&gt; 01:27:36,960<br>to imagine multiple schemes, right?</p>
<p>949<br>01:27:36,960 –&gt; 01:27:37,920<br>They’re getting out of this.</p>
<p>950<br>01:27:37,920 –&gt; 01:27:42,159<br>Uh, one, you could then make a checkpoint, uh, off the state, you know,</p>
<p>951<br>01:27:42,159 –&gt; 01:27:46,079<br>build on the ledger and include the hash with that checkpoint into the ledger.</p>
<p>952<br>01:27:46,719 –&gt; 01:27:50,399<br>And then as long as you can replicate the checkpoint widely,</p>
<p>953<br>01:27:51,039 –&gt; 01:27:54,479<br>and then you can basically start running from the checkpoint and cut out the beginning.</p>
<p>954<br>01:27:55,279 –&gt; 01:27:58,159<br>This is like not unlike, you know, what we’re doing in lap, you know,</p>
<p>955<br>01:27:58,159 –&gt; 01:27:59,199<br>what graph is doing, correct?</p>
<p>956<br>01:28:01,279 –&gt; 01:28:04,159<br>Well, the party that does that have to be trusted or,</p>
<p>957<br>01:28:05,759 –&gt; 01:28:08,719<br>what we did, I did, uh,</p>
<p>958<br>01:28:10,719 –&gt; 01:28:16,159<br>presumably declines want to go, I have to go along and you realize that they should get</p>
<p>959<br>01:28:16,159 –&gt; 01:28:19,840<br>to get that checkpoint and be able to construct, you know, the current state of the world.</p>
<p>960<br>01:28:20,799 –&gt; 01:28:24,880<br>So I presume that we require some critical change and presumably some fork then.</p>
<p>961<br>01:28:24,960 –&gt; 01:28:26,960<br>And</p>
<p>962<br>01:28:28,960 –&gt; 01:28:30,560<br>this is not a huge issue, correct?</p>
<p>963<br>01:28:30,560 –&gt; 01:28:34,480<br>It leads with the rate of Bitcoin because like, you know, the number of transactions for,</p>
<p>964<br>01:28:34,480 –&gt; 01:28:36,480<br>you know, second, you can do is actually small.</p>
<p>965<br>01:28:37,039 –&gt; 01:28:40,560<br>And like, if you remember from the Bitcoin paper, there’s some calculation like, you know,</p>
<p>966<br>01:28:40,560 –&gt; 01:28:42,800<br>what the total size would be if you do this.</p>
<p>967<br>01:28:43,840 –&gt; 01:28:47,920<br>Furthermore, if you remember correctly from the Bitcoin paper, there’s a bunch of</p>
<p>968<br>01:28:47,920 –&gt; 01:28:54,239<br>optimizations where you don’t really have to remember every transaction, uh, for every coin,</p>
<p>969<br>01:28:54,239 –&gt; 01:28:57,599<br>you basically have to remember the last transaction for every coin.</p>
<p>970<br>01:28:58,159 –&gt; 01:29:03,439<br>And you could do that by just remembering the, uh, block headers instead of the complete block.</p>
<p>971<br>01:29:07,039 –&gt; 01:29:09,599<br>So Bitcoin has sort of a built-in solution to this problem.</p>
<p>972<br>01:29:10,880 –&gt; 01:29:16,079<br>I see. So the main bottleneck is more or less when new machines come up, they need to verify</p>
<p>973<br>01:29:16,079 –&gt; 01:29:17,199<br>the hunch. Yeah.</p>
<p>974<br>01:29:17,199 –&gt; 01:29:20,880<br>But after that, then things are relatively more optimized.</p>
<p>975<br>01:29:20,880 –&gt; 01:29:21,760<br>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>976<br>01:29:23,199 –&gt; 01:29:23,599<br>Thank you.</p>
<p>977<br>01:29:24,479 –&gt; 01:29:25,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>978<br>01:29:35,760 –&gt; 01:29:36,960<br>Okay. That’s for today.</p>
<p>979<br>01:29:39,439 –&gt; 01:29:40,079<br>Thank you all.</p>
<p>980<br>01:29:40,079 –&gt; 01:29:49,760<br>See you first day.</p>
