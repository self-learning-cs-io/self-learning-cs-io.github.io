                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,080<br>Today we’re going to talk about regular expressions.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,080 –&gt; 00:00:10,800<br>This is another in the series of ingenious algorithms that we’re looking at in the second half</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,800 –&gt; 00:00:12,400<br>of this course.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,400 –&gt; 00:00:16,519<br>This is really one of the most widely used and one of the coolest algorithms that we’re</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:16,519 –&gt; 00:00:18,320<br>going to cover.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:18,320 –&gt; 00:00:21,960<br>To get started we have to talk about what is a regular expression.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:21,960 –&gt; 00:00:27,800<br>And just putting the problem in context we’ve always talked about before, on the last lecture</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:27,800 –&gt; 00:00:32,600<br>we talked about the substring search problem which we’re just trying to find one string</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:32,600 –&gt; 00:00:34,200<br>in a text.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:34,200 –&gt; 00:00:37,880<br>Now we’re talking about a more general problem, pattern matching problem, where we find</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:37,880 –&gt; 00:00:41,760<br>one of a specified set of strings in the text.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:41,760 –&gt; 00:00:46,920<br>So that specified set rather than talk about one string we have to describe a set of</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:46,920 –&gt; 00:00:50,640<br>strings and that’s what regular expressions are all about.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:50,640 –&gt; 00:00:57,560<br>Here’s an example from genomics, an actual example from a real life scientific data processing.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:57,560 –&gt; 00:01:05,480<br>So there’s a thing called fragile X syndrome.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:05,480 –&gt; 00:01:14,800<br>The human genome contains a string that consists of C, T’s, A’s and G’s, the way we’ve talked</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:14,800 –&gt; 00:01:20,719<br>about before, and they naturally group themselves into groups of three.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:20,719 –&gt; 00:01:28,159<br>And there’s a way to describe a correlation with the syndrome from a property of the text</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,159 –&gt; 00:01:31,000<br>string or the genome string.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:31,000 –&gt; 00:01:35,519<br>The actual scientific data is shown over here on the right but we’ll just work with the</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:35,519 –&gt; 00:01:37,280<br>text strings.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:37,280 –&gt; 00:01:46,359<br>And the English, the description is that you’ve got somewhere in your genome repeats of either</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:46,359 –&gt; 00:01:56,760<br>CGG or AGG that are bracketed by GCG at the beginning and CTG at the end.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:56,760 –&gt; 00:01:59,560<br>Now the number of repeats inside is variable.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:59,560 –&gt; 00:02:05,239<br>So in this case we’ve got GCG, that’s the beginning thing.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:05,239 –&gt; 00:02:12,920<br>And then we’ve got a CGG, that’s one, AGG, that’s two, CGG, that’s three.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:12,920 –&gt; 00:02:15,680<br>So we got three repeats, I want of these two patterns.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:15,680 –&gt; 00:02:17,960<br>And then we have CGG.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:17,960 –&gt; 00:02:22,400<br>Now different genome might have many more of these triplet patterns inside.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:22,400 –&gt; 00:02:30,080<br>The number of repeats is variable but high repeats is correlated with fragile X syndrome.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:30,080 –&gt; 00:02:37,719<br>So clearly medical professionals want to know given a genome does it have a high number</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:37,719 –&gt; 00:02:41,240<br>of repeats with this kind of pattern.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:41,240 –&gt; 00:02:46,360<br>And if so then we want to look out for this fragile X syndrome.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:46,360 –&gt; 00:02:52,159<br>And the specifying the problem in English is one thing but specifying it in a way that’s</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:52,159 –&gt; 00:02:57,280<br>amenable to writing a program to help us find these patterns is another.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:57,280 –&gt; 00:02:59,800<br>And this is the way that we specify the pattern.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:59,800 –&gt; 00:03:01,920<br>This thing is called a regular expression.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:01,920 –&gt; 00:03:09,920<br>So it’s take a CGG and then either a CGG, GCG, and then either a CGG or an AGG.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:09,919 –&gt; 00:03:13,000<br>Many number of times followed by a CGG.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:13,000 –&gt; 00:03:18,199<br>That’s specifying a set of strings and we want to find if the text has one of that specified</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:18,199 –&gt; 00:03:21,119<br>set.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:21,119 –&gt; 00:03:27,399<br>Here’s another example where regular expressions appear in real life.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:27,399 –&gt; 00:03:36,759<br>There’s a new source highlight program that we use to highlight syntax, I like keywords</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:36,759 –&gt; 00:03:42,359<br>in our text and also gray out comments and so forth.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:42,359 –&gt; 00:03:46,759<br>And this is a very general program that works for many different kinds of languages and</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:46,759 –&gt; 00:03:51,799<br>outputs to many different print formats.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:51,799 –&gt; 00:03:57,000<br>And that’s all about identifying one of a specified set of strings in the text and doing</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:57,000 –&gt; 00:03:58,000<br>something with it.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:58,000 –&gt; 00:04:02,759<br>It’s an application of regular expressions in real life.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:02,759 –&gt; 00:04:12,120<br>In Google you can search in public search code, it’s public source code for regular expression</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:12,120 –&gt; 00:04:19,000<br>search so you can search for code that contains any one of a specified set of strings and</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:19,000 –&gt; 00:04:22,439<br>that’s a available facility on the web.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:22,439 –&gt; 00:04:24,719<br>There’s many, many other applications.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:24,720 –&gt; 00:04:30,200<br>The one is a pro site in biology.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:30,200 –&gt; 00:04:37,480<br>There’s a bunch of specified patterns that you can use to search the genome.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:37,480 –&gt; 00:04:43,960<br>Or processing natural language is all about string processing and specifying sets of strings,</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:43,960 –&gt; 00:04:47,520<br>programming languages themselves.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:47,520 –&gt; 00:04:53,200<br>And another one we’ll look at later on is validating when you’re getting data entry from the</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:53,200 –&gt; 00:04:54,200<br>web.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:54,199 –&gt; 00:04:58,159<br>And you type in a credit card number you’re told whether it’s legal or not and that’s</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:58,159 –&gt; 00:05:00,000<br>all done with regular expressions.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:00,000 –&gt; 00:05:04,079<br>It’s the string you typed in one of the specified sets.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:04,079 –&gt; 00:05:10,439<br>So this is a very widely used and widely useful application.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:10,439 –&gt; 00:05:20,099<br>So we’re going to look into the more general idea that this brings out is the idea of</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:20,100 –&gt; 00:05:27,740<br>parsing text files and not only finding if a string match is a pattern but finding the</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:27,740 –&gt; 00:05:32,939<br>structure of a string that we can use in some kind of beneficial way.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:32,939 –&gt; 00:05:35,500<br>And we’ll come back to it more.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:35,500 –&gt; 00:05:41,660<br>So we’re looking at a basic capability that’s widely useful but it also extends to cover</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:41,660 –&gt; 00:05:46,500<br>deep issues and processes in computer science.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:46,500 –&gt; 00:05:48,540<br>So what is a regular expression?</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:48,540 –&gt; 00:05:53,220<br>Well it’s simply a notation to specify a set of strings.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:53,220 –&gt; 00:05:55,140<br>The set could be infinite.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:55,140 –&gt; 00:05:59,580<br>We’re going to specify it with a finite pattern but it could be infinite.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:59,580 –&gt; 00:06:05,460<br>And we make a regular expression up just from four simple operations.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:05,460 –&gt; 00:06:08,020<br>First one is called concatenation.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:08,020 –&gt; 00:06:12,740<br>So that’s we just take a bunch of letters and put them one after the other.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:12,740 –&gt; 00:06:19,379<br>And a regular expression made from concatenation matches exactly precisely the sequence of</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:19,379 –&gt; 00:06:23,540<br>characters that are specified and it doesn’t match anything else.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:23,540 –&gt; 00:06:31,259<br>So that’s a simple one by itself and that’s what we use for substring search for example.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:31,259 –&gt; 00:06:33,060<br>Then there’s OR.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:33,060 –&gt; 00:06:39,819<br>So that one we give two different regular expressions and put a vertical bar between them and</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:39,819 –&gt; 00:06:44,540<br>that says we’re specifying now a set of size two and we’re happy to match either string</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:44,540 –&gt; 00:06:49,300<br>in that set on there’s no other string that we match.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:49,300 –&gt; 00:06:53,740<br>And then there’s one called closure and this is where infinite comes in.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:53,740 –&gt; 00:07:00,139<br>So when we put a star after a character or a regular expression as we’ll see that’s</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:00,139 –&gt; 00:07:04,860<br>specifying zero or more occurrences of that character.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:04,860 –&gt; 00:07:10,460<br>So AA matches a, b star a because that’s zero or occurrences of b in between or a with</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:10,460 –&gt; 00:07:18,699<br>eight b’s followed by an a matches because that’s got zero or more b’s in between the two a’s.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:18,699 –&gt; 00:07:23,500<br>But if you don’t have an a at the beginning and the end or if you don’t have all b’s inside</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:23,500 –&gt; 00:07:28,300<br>it doesn’t match and that’s an infinite number string zero or any number of occurrences of</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:29,100 –&gt; 00:07:33,980<br>b. So with just four characters we’re specifying an infinite set of strings.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:35,500 –&gt; 00:07:44,620<br>And then the next operation to allow us to build regular expressions of arbitrary complexity</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:44,620 –&gt; 00:07:52,300<br>is simply parentheses. If you include regular expressions within parentheses then you can apply</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:52,379 –&gt; 00:08:01,259<br>the star operator or concatenation to another regular expression. So these are examples of</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:02,139 –&gt; 00:08:08,780<br>regular expressions using parentheses. So this says a and then what’s inside the parentheses</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:08,780 –&gt; 00:08:15,100<br>which is the regular expression that says either a or b and then followed by a a b. So that matches</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:15,100 –&gt; 00:08:21,259<br>precisely these two strings either a followed by an a followed by a b or a followed by a b followed</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:21,819 –&gt; 00:08:27,899<br>and it doesn’t match anything else. Or if you put a more complicated regular expression inside</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:27,899 –&gt; 00:08:34,779<br>parentheses with a star it still means zero or more occurrences. So just a would be zero occurrences</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:35,659 –&gt; 00:08:41,740<br>and then this is one two three four occurrences of a b followed by a. And again if it’s not of that</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:41,740 –&gt; 00:08:50,539<br>form it doesn’t match. This one doesn’t have an a b and neither does this. It has one a b but then</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:50,539 –&gt; 00:08:56,539<br>the next one would have to be either a b or a. There’s no way to get one of these strings by</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:56,539 –&gt; 00:09:04,059<br>including zero more occurrences of a b. These things here are a precedence order when we perform</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:04,059 –&gt; 00:09:11,339<br>the operations. So the first thing is parentheses. The next thing is the star and next thing is concatenation</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:11,339 –&gt; 00:09:20,059<br>and finally the or operation. In this table then completely specifies what we mean by a regular</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:20,059 –&gt; 00:09:27,739<br>expression. It’s a sequence of characters, alphabet characters like a and b and meta characters</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:27,739 –&gt; 00:09:34,059<br>like or and star and parentheses that we use to describe possibly infinite set of strings.</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:35,179 –&gt; 00:09:44,939<br>Now in the real world it’s often worthwhile and useful to add some additional operations for</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:44,940 –&gt; 00:09:52,220<br>convenience. For example the wild card operation is to have a dot another meta character that matches</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:52,220 –&gt; 00:10:02,380<br>any letter at all. And that’s a shorthand for listing all the letters separated by or and then</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:03,020 –&gt; 00:10:10,380<br>but that’s a lot of characters and so with one character we can match the same regular expression.</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:11,340 –&gt; 00:10:18,139<br>And so this one you can use like to solve a crossword puzzle for example. This one matches all the</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:18,139 –&gt; 00:10:25,019<br>words that we have alternating use all the seven letter words have alternating use. And so there’s</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:25,019 –&gt; 00:10:30,059<br>a couple but there’s some other ones that sort of have alternating use but not quite on the</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:30,059 –&gt; 00:10:36,539<br>don’t match. That’s a wild card character. And then there’s classes of characters so</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:38,379 –&gt; 00:10:45,579<br>capital A dash Z means any capital letter and then small A dash Z means any lowercase letter.</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:46,779 –&gt; 00:10:54,859<br>So any capitalized letter any lowercase letter followed by any number of lowercase letters will</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:54,860 –&gt; 00:11:00,139<br>match something like this but it won’t match something like that. So classes of characters. And</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:00,139 –&gt; 00:11:08,139<br>again this is shorthand for typing all the characters and using the word. At least one so rather</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:08,139 –&gt; 00:11:16,060<br>than star which says zero or more occurrences plus means one or more occurrences. So that’s another</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:16,060 –&gt; 00:11:24,620<br>example of a convenience shorthand or exactly K putting in braces that I want to specify this is</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:24,620 –&gt; 00:11:30,940<br>specifies I want exactly five digits followed by a dash followed by exactly four digits. So that’s</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:30,940 –&gt; 00:11:38,620<br>a way to specify something like a legal plus four zip code and it doesn’t match other things.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:39,659 –&gt; 00:11:48,620<br>Now in practical in terms of practical clients these types of shorthands are extremely important</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:48,620 –&gt; 00:11:57,019<br>in terms of the theory and the idea of processing regular expression since we can specify them all</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:57,019 –&gt; 00:12:04,139<br>with the basic operations we’ll pretty much ignore them in our code. So in every in every case</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:05,019 –&gt; 00:12:12,060<br>we could write A plus if we wanted we could write this long hand of it but of course uses are</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:12,060 –&gt; 00:12:17,500<br>going to write the shorthand but still if we have a mechanism for dealing with this then we can</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:17,500 –&gt; 00:12:27,019<br>certainly take care of the shorthand. So just with those basic operations and also the shorthand is</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:27,019 –&gt; 00:12:35,100<br>helpful our notation is amazingly expressive that’s really a lot you can do with it. So for example you</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:35,100 –&gt; 00:12:42,779<br>can do substring search with a regular expression. One way to express the substring search problem is</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:42,779 –&gt; 00:12:49,579<br>to put your string preceded by dot star and put a dot star at the end and that asking if your</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:49,579 –&gt; 00:12:55,659<br>string is in the infinite language described by this regular expression is equivalent to the substring</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:55,659 –&gt; 00:13:01,500<br>search problem. It matches if and only if that strings in there. So for example on these two and not</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:01,500 –&gt; 00:13:09,899<br>in that too. So notation covers the substring search problem but then also it can specify easily</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:10,860 –&gt; 00:13:18,699<br>useful sets of strings that we often want to check. So this is similar to the z plus four.</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:18,699 –&gt; 00:13:23,340<br>It’s three digits followed by dash followed by two digits followed by dash followed by four digits.</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:23,899 –&gt; 00:13:29,500<br>That’s a good start towards knowing whether the string is a legal social security number or not</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:31,419 –&gt; 00:13:38,299<br>or is it a legal email address or not. This is a simplified version but it basically says you</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:38,299 –&gt; 00:13:44,779<br>ought to have at least one letter followed by an ad and followed by some letters followed by a dot</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:44,779 –&gt; 00:13:51,979<br>followed by edu or com or of course to cover all email addresses you need to consider some more</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:51,979 –&gt; 00:14:01,419<br>possibilities. But this is a quick and succinct way to specify a set of strings or Java identifier</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:01,419 –&gt; 00:14:07,740<br>or what’s a legal Java identifier. So this is one way to specify a legal jargon, Java identifier.</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:08,299 –&gt; 00:14:15,179<br>And indeed programming languages like Java use regular expressions like this to define what they</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:15,179 –&gt; 00:14:20,059<br>mean by a legal identifier and then the kinds of processes that we’re going to talk about to</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:20,059 –&gt; 00:14:25,659<br>actually check that what you type is legal. And that goes all the way up to the program itself.</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:27,899 –&gt; 00:14:35,979<br>Is this a legal Java program is almost but not quite as we’ll see in a regular expression</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:35,980 –&gt; 00:14:44,460<br>pattern matching problem. Very very expressive and widely used language. Now what’s really interesting</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:44,460 –&gt; 00:14:50,539<br>about this topic and we’ll just touch on it although it’s extremely important to what we’re going</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:50,539 –&gt; 00:15:00,379<br>to do is that just from the standpoint of the theory of computation starting with time of touring</p>
<p>151<br>00:15:00,379 –&gt; 00:15:07,740<br>and others in the 30s regular expressions play an important role in our understanding of the</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:07,740 –&gt; 00:15:15,580<br>theory of computation. And that understanding actually has led to the algorithm that we’re going</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:15,580 –&gt; 00:15:24,220<br>to talk about. That’s a very interesting aspect of this. But still even given that regular</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:24,379 –&gt; 00:15:31,019<br>regular expressions are just useful in everyday life. This is an example of someone that used a</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:31,019 –&gt; 00:15:43,420<br>regular expression to screen a job candidate and this is actually illegal to look for words like</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:43,420 –&gt; 00:15:53,019<br>anron or carry or busher gore or republican to decide whether a job candidate’s application will</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:53,019 –&gt; 00:16:01,340<br>get through. This one uses an exclamation point which means just end with anything. It’s like that</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:01,340 –&gt; 00:16:15,740<br>star. So someone typical computer user can learn to use regular expressions with great effect.</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:16,700 –&gt; 00:16:25,100<br>Even Google supports regular Google search window supports star as a full word wild card</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:25,100 –&gt; 00:16:35,259<br>or for union although not a full regular expression pattern matching although that day is surely coming.</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:36,860 –&gt; 00:16:43,899<br>So people who just get into it just a little bit and start to see the utility of regular expression</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:43,899 –&gt; 00:16:52,860<br>certainly get excited about it and you can find examples of this all through the web. This is an</p>
<p>163<br>00:16:52,860 –&gt; 00:17:03,419<br>XKCD comic about it where there’s a problem. How can we search through 200 megabytes of emails</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:03,419 –&gt; 00:17:08,700<br>looking for something format like an address. And lawyers want to do this all the time nowadays</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:08,700 –&gt; 00:17:16,220<br>and it’s hopeless. But no, I know regular expressions and the regular expression super being</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:17,259 –&gt; 00:17:24,380<br>swoops to the rescue and types of regular expression in Perl which is a widely used language</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:24,380 –&gt; 00:17:29,420<br>that’s based on regular expressions. We’ll talk about it briefly in a minute and swoops away. So</p>
<p>168<br>00:17:29,420 –&gt; 00:17:35,340<br>there is somewhat of a feeling of people that know just a little bit that regular expressions</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:36,139 –&gt; 00:17:42,699<br>can be used to solve any problem. That’s not quite true as we know from the theory computation and</p>
<p>170<br>00:17:42,699 –&gt; 00:17:50,539<br>we’ll also touch on that a little bit. So the question is can the average programmer learn to use</p>
<p>171<br>00:17:50,539 –&gt; 00:17:56,539<br>regular expressions effectively. There’s all kinds of evidence out there that lots of programmers use</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:56,539 –&gt; 00:18:03,819<br>them extensively but not to throw cold water on it but we have to take everything with some</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:03,819 –&gt; 00:18:09,500<br>restraint. And here’s an example of a regular expression that you can find out on the web.</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:10,460 –&gt; 00:18:15,819<br>It’s written in Perl but it’s a regular expression not to check whether an email address is valid or not.</p>
<p>175<br>00:18:17,819 –&gt; 00:18:24,539<br>Now that is quite a regular expression. In one might argue whether that’s really an effective</p>
<p>176<br>00:18:24,539 –&gt; 00:18:31,740<br>way to use regular expressions. Maybe there’s a simpler and easier way not to check for a valid email</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:31,740 –&gt; 00:18:39,099<br>address. But anyway this one’s out there and is used probably being used efficiently somewhere</p>
<p>178<br>00:18:39,099 –&gt; 00:18:48,700<br>effectively somewhere today. But really for people who are educated in computer science need to know</p>
<p>179<br>00:18:48,700 –&gt; 00:18:56,140<br>that regular expressions are definitely powerful tools but writing a regular expression really is</p>
<p>180<br>00:18:56,140 –&gt; 00:19:04,380<br>like writing a program. You have to understand the underlying programming model. It’s often even more</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:04,380 –&gt; 00:19:10,300<br>so than many programming languages since there’s so few rules it’s easier to write a regular expression</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:10,300 –&gt; 00:19:15,580<br>than a district read one. And if it’s difficult to read it means it’s difficult to debug.</p>
<p>183<br>00:19:17,020 –&gt; 00:19:24,700<br>And so you can find a lot of flaming on the web about this. And this is a particular apt</p>
<p>184<br>00:19:24,700 –&gt; 00:19:30,140<br>particularly apt quote. Some people when confronted with a problem think I know I’ll use regular</p>
<p>185<br>00:19:30,140 –&gt; 00:19:38,220<br>expressions. Now they have two problems. And I think that’s a good way to summarize the bottom line</p>
<p>186<br>00:19:38,220 –&gt; 00:19:46,460<br>that regular expressions are amazingly powerful and expressive. But they can get very complex</p>
<p>187<br>00:19:46,460 –&gt; 00:19:52,860<br>in an error firm in real applications. Still there’s plenty of real applications where they can be</p>
<p>188<br>00:19:52,859 –&gt; 00:19:58,619<br>succinct and effective. And so we’re going to look next at regular expression pattern matching algorithm.</p>
