                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,799<br>Welcome back. Today we’re going to look at quicksort. That was named as one of the most</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,799 –&gt; 00:00:12,800<br>important algorithms of the 20th century and is widely used for system sorts in many other</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:12,800 –&gt; 00:00:19,640<br>applications. Last lecture we looked at mergesort, another classic sorting algorithm that’s</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,640 –&gt; 00:00:23,879<br>used in many systems and today we’re going to look at quicksort which is used in many</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,879 –&gt; 00:00:33,079<br>others. You can even get a quicksort t-shirt nowadays. So what is the quicksort method? It’s also</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:33,079 –&gt; 00:00:38,879<br>a recursive method but the basic idea behind quicksort is that it does the recursion after it</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:38,879 –&gt; 00:00:44,679<br>does the work, whereas mergesort did it before it did the work. So the idea is first randomly</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:44,679 –&gt; 00:00:49,359<br>shuffle the array, that’s an important step that we’ll talk about later. And then partition</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:49,359 –&gt; 00:00:56,159<br>the array. So that’s to divide it so that for some value j, the entry a of j is in place in the</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:56,159 –&gt; 00:01:03,799<br>array. There’s no larger entry to the left of j and no smaller entry to the right of j. Once we have</p>
<p>11<br>00:01:03,799 –&gt; 00:01:08,840<br>the array partitioned in that way, shown here in the middle, right here we have k in its position</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:08,840 –&gt; 00:01:13,799<br>and we have everybody to the left, there’s nobody greater than k and everybody to the right there’s</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:13,799 –&gt; 00:01:20,280<br>nobody less. Once we have it arranged in that way, then we recursively sort the two parts,</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:20,280 –&gt; 00:01:25,239<br>sort the left part, sort the right part and then after those two things are done, the whole thing is</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:25,239 –&gt; 00:01:33,239<br>sort of, this method was invented in 1961 by Tony Hoar who won the Turing Award in 1980 for this</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:33,239 –&gt; 00:01:41,560<br>and other work. So let’s look at a demo of how quicksort partitioning works. The idea is to</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:42,120 –&gt; 00:01:47,079<br>arbitrarily choose the first element to be the partitioning element. Since we shuffled the array,</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:47,079 –&gt; 00:01:52,040<br>that’s a random element from the array. And then we’re going to maintain an i pointer that moves</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:52,040 –&gt; 00:01:57,400<br>from left to right and a j pointer that moves from right to left. Let’s look how it works in the demo.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:59,879 –&gt; 00:02:06,439<br>So we start again by picking k as the partitioning element and then our method is to move the i</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:06,439 –&gt; 00:02:13,079<br>pointer from left to right as long as what we have is less than the partitioning element and move</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:13,079 –&gt; 00:02:18,680<br>the j pointer from right to left as long as it points to an item that’s greater than the partitioning</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:18,680 –&gt; 00:02:24,599<br>element. So in this example, the i pointer stops right away because it’s pointing to an r,</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:24,599 –&gt; 00:02:31,159<br>which is bigger than the partitioning element. The j pointer decrements until it gets to the c,</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:31,159 –&gt; 00:02:36,120<br>which stops there because that’s less than the partitioning element. And so now what’s</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:36,120 –&gt; 00:02:42,680<br>going to happen is those two elements are out of place, the partitioning elements in between them</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:42,680 –&gt; 00:02:48,280<br>and they’re in the wrong order. So all we want to do is exchange those and then move on. Now we</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:48,280 –&gt; 00:02:53,240<br>increment i as long as it’s pointing to an element that’s less than the partitioning element.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:53,879 –&gt; 00:02:58,920<br>Stop here at t because that’s bigger. And now we decrement j as long as it’s pointing to</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:58,920 –&gt; 00:03:04,920<br>something that’s bigger than the partitioning element. Stop here at i because that’s less. Again,</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:04,919 –&gt; 00:03:11,479<br>t and i are in the wrong places. If we exchange them will maintain the invariant that everything to</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:11,479 –&gt; 00:03:15,959<br>the left of i is less than the partitioning element or nothing to the left of i is greater than the</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:15,959 –&gt; 00:03:20,839<br>partitioning element and nothing to the right of j is less than the partitioning element. So</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:20,839 –&gt; 00:03:28,439<br>exchange them. Increment i as long as it’s less, stop at l. Increment j is decrement j as long as</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:28,439 –&gt; 00:03:35,800<br>it’s greater. Stop at e. Those two elements are out of position so exchange them. Now increment i</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:36,759 –&gt; 00:03:43,240<br>stop at the l which is greater than k, decrement j, stop at e which is less than k. And now at this</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:43,240 –&gt; 00:03:48,840<br>point the partitioning process is complete because the point is of cross and we’ve looked at everything in</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:48,840 –&gt; 00:03:58,360<br>the array. In fact, j points to the right most element in the left sub files everything that’s</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:58,360 –&gt; 00:04:06,199<br>not greater than k so we can just exchange j with our partitioning element and now we’ve achieved</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:06,199 –&gt; 00:04:13,080<br>the goal of partitioning the array so that a of j is in its position, nobody to the left is greater,</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:13,080 –&gt; 00:04:21,800<br>nobody to the right is less. Now the code for partitioning is straightforward to implement.</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:22,680 –&gt; 00:04:30,120<br>Down below shows the state of the array before partitioning during and after partitioning.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:30,680 –&gt; 00:04:35,879<br>So in the end the j pointer is pointing to the partitioning element v which was in position v</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:35,879 –&gt; 00:04:42,360<br>in the first place. In the all during the partitioning process the code is maintaining this</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:42,360 –&gt; 00:04:47,240<br>invariant where everything to the left of i is less than r, everything to the right of j is</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:47,240 –&gt; 00:04:55,400<br>greater than r, and we haven’t looked at things in between. So finding increment i as long as it’s</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:55,400 –&gt; 00:04:59,560<br>less is a simple while loop and then we put a test to make sure we don’t run off the right end of</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:59,560 –&gt; 00:05:05,960<br>the array and decrement j as long as it’s pointing to a bigger element similarly just a while loop where</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:05,960 –&gt; 00:05:10,920<br>we put in a test to make sure we don’t run off the left end of the array. Then there’s a test to</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:10,920 –&gt; 00:05:18,199<br>see if the pointer’s cross swap the elements at i and j. When we get to the pointers cross we break</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:18,199 –&gt; 00:05:25,560<br>out of the loop and exchange the partitioning element into position. So that’s a quick implementation</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:25,560 –&gt; 00:05:35,160<br>of the quicksort partitioning method. Now quicksort itself then is going to be a recursive program</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:35,240 –&gt; 00:05:42,840<br>that uses that partitioning method. The first thing we do is the public sort method that takes the</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:42,840 –&gt; 00:05:48,680<br>array of comparable items as its argument is going to do a shuffle and that shuffle is needed to</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:48,680 –&gt; 00:05:54,040<br>make sure that we can guarantee that the performance is going to be good. And then it calls the recursive</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:54,040 –&gt; 00:06:00,840<br>method that takes this argument the limits of the subarray that’s going to be sorted. So then partitioning</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:00,839 –&gt; 00:06:06,839<br>simply does the partitioning tells us which element is in position and then recursively sorts the</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:06,839 –&gt; 00:06:13,879<br>left part that’s loaded j minus 1 and then the right part that’s j plus 1 to high. That’s a complete</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:13,879 –&gt; 00:06:22,519<br>implementation of quicksort. Again as with merge sort studying the recursive trace is instructive</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:23,239 –&gt; 00:06:30,359<br>and this one is kind of upside down as compared to merge sort. The first line shows the partitioning</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:30,360 –&gt; 00:06:39,240<br>where k is put into position. Then the method calls the sort for the left subfile first and then</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:39,240 –&gt; 00:06:46,040<br>that’s going to be partition on this e and so forth. Eventually we get down to small subfiles. Actually</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:46,040 –&gt; 00:06:53,080<br>our code doesn’t do anything at all for subarrays of size one. So we just leave those in gray and then</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:53,079 –&gt; 00:07:01,560<br>it does the right subfile and so forth. Again studying this trace like this gives a good feeling for</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:01,560 –&gt; 00:07:10,759<br>exactly what’s going on in the recursive program. Let’s look at any animation of quicksort and operation.</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:12,519 –&gt; 00:07:17,079<br>There’s the partition now it’s working on the left now it’s partitioning the right now it’s</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:17,079 –&gt; 00:07:23,079<br>working on the left part of the right now it’s partitioning what’s left knowing the left part of</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:23,079 –&gt; 00:07:29,079<br>that and working from left to right but dividing each subarray in half as it goes.</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:31,159 –&gt; 00:07:37,240<br>So let’s look consider some of the details and implementation of partitioning with quicksort.</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:37,240 –&gt; 00:07:43,959<br>So first thing is the partition is in place you could use an extra array and the partitioning</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:43,959 –&gt; 00:07:49,079<br>code would be a little bit easier but one of the big advantages of quicksort over merge sort is</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:49,079 –&gt; 00:07:56,680<br>that it doesn’t take any extra space it gets the sort done in place. Now you have to be a little</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:56,680 –&gt; 00:08:01,399<br>bit careful with terminating the loop. When we give you working code it’s not hard to see why it</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:01,399 –&gt; 00:08:07,560<br>works and you might go through the exercise of trying to implement quicksort without looking at</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:07,560 –&gt; 00:08:13,959<br>our code and you’ll find the testing when the pointers cross can be a little bit tricky particularly</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:13,959 –&gt; 00:08:22,840<br>in the presence of duplicate keys. Also staying in bounds actually in our implementation the test</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:22,840 –&gt; 00:08:28,759<br>of the j pointer running off the left end is redundant. Why is it redundant? Well the partition</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:28,759 –&gt; 00:08:34,120<br>element sitting there and it’ll stop when it hits the partitioning element but the other test is</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:34,120 –&gt; 00:08:43,080<br>not in our implementation. And the key thing one key thing is that the way that also be randomly</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:43,080 –&gt; 00:08:49,480<br>ordered actually some implementations of quicksort on the wild don’t have this property and they</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:49,480 –&gt; 00:08:54,840<br>suffer a little bit in performance. That random shuffle at the beginning is important and needed</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:54,840 –&gt; 00:09:00,759<br>for guaranteeing performance. And the other thing I haven’t I’ve referred to but not talked about in</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:00,759 –&gt; 00:09:07,879<br>detail is the presence of equal keys. You might think it would be better to handle equal keys in</p>
<p>84<br>00:09:07,879 –&gt; 00:09:13,319<br>some special way and we’ll talk about that in a second. But this general purpose implementation</p>
<p>85<br>00:09:13,319 –&gt; 00:09:18,759<br>stops the pointers on keys equal to the partitioning items key and we’ll take a look at why that’s</p>
<p>86<br>00:09:18,759 –&gt; 00:09:26,279<br>important in a minute. So now let’s look at the running time estimates about why we care about</p>
<p>87<br>00:09:26,279 –&gt; 00:09:31,480<br>quicksort versus merge sort. This is extending the shuffle it’s more likely that this lecture</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:31,480 –&gt; 00:09:36,039<br>will land because of a lightning strike or your computer will be struck by a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:36,039 –&gt; 00:09:43,079<br>So we can discount that. The average case which is extremely likely for any practical application</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:43,079 –&gt; 00:09:50,679<br>is going to be about 1.39 n log n. So that’s more compares than merge sort uses but quicksort is</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:50,679 –&gt; 00:09:55,639<br>much faster because it doesn’t do much corresponding to each compare. It just does the compare and</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:55,639 –&gt; 00:10:01,480<br>increment a pointer whereas merge sort has to move the items into and out of the auxiliary array</p>
<p>93<br>00:10:01,480 –&gt; 00:10:09,000<br>which is more expensive. So the random shuffle is a key for good performance in quicksort. It gives</p>
<p>94<br>00:10:09,000 –&gt; 00:10:15,319<br>us the guarantee that the worst case is not going to happen. And also it allows us to develop a</p>
<p>95<br>00:10:15,319 –&gt; 00:10:20,840<br>math model that we can go ahead and validate with experimentation. You run quicksort and you count</p>
<p>96<br>00:10:20,840 –&gt; 00:10:26,680<br>compares if you did the random shuffle it’ll be about 1.39 n log n compares and it’s running time</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:27,399 –&gt; 00:10:32,680<br>will be proportional to n log n and it’ll be a fast sort and that’s what people do and that’s why</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:32,680 –&gt; 00:10:39,399<br>people use it. Now there are some things that you have to watch out for with quicksort because</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:39,399 –&gt; 00:10:46,120<br>the implementation is a bit fragile and it’s easy to make mistakes and you’ll find textbook</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:46,120 –&gt; 00:10:53,159<br>implementations or implementations out on the web that wind up running in quadratic time in</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:53,159 –&gt; 00:10:59,399<br>certain situations. You have to be a little bit careful of that and even if everything is</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:59,399 –&gt; 00:11:05,480<br>randomized if there’s lots of duplicates in the implementations not done quite right the quicksort</p>
<p>103<br>00:11:05,480 –&gt; 00:11:13,879<br>might take quadratic time. So let’s summarize the properties of quicksort. It’s in place. It doesn’t</p>
<p>104<br>00:11:13,879 –&gt; 00:11:26,759<br>use any extra space. The depth of recursion so that’s again dependent on the random shuffling</p>
<p>105<br>00:11:26,759 –&gt; 00:11:32,919<br>is going to be log rhythmic. You can limit the depth of recursion by always doing the smaller sub-ray</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:32,919 –&gt; 00:11:37,159<br>before the larger sub-ray but that’s not really necessary nowadays as long as you’ve done the</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:38,120 –&gt; 00:11:45,159<br>random shuffle. Oh and by the way quicksort is not stable because partitioning does one of</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:45,159 –&gt; 00:11:53,159<br>those long range exchanges that might put a key with equal value over a key another key with the</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:53,159 –&gt; 00:12:01,720<br>same value. So it’s a little more work to make quicksort and stable and maybe using extra space.</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:01,720 –&gt; 00:12:09,639<br>So what about in actually in practice this is our fastest sorting algorithm and there’s a few</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:09,639 –&gt; 00:12:16,360<br>ways to make it even faster and we looked at some similar things with merge sort and it’s definitely</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:16,360 –&gt; 00:12:24,120<br>worthwhile taking implementing for quicksort. First thing is small sub-arrays. Even quicksort has</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:24,120 –&gt; 00:12:30,519<br>more overhead than you want for a tiny array like one of size two or three or four so can implement it</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:30,519 –&gt; 00:12:38,679<br>to cut off to insertion sort for smaller arrays and the exact number that uses not too critical</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:38,679 –&gt; 00:12:46,439<br>can anywhere between 10 and 20 will improve the running time by maybe 20%. Also you could just not</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:46,439 –&gt; 00:12:52,439<br>do anything for smaller arrays and then do the insertion sort in one pass at the end. So that’s a</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:52,439 –&gt; 00:12:59,480<br>first improvement. Second improvement is to try to estimate the partitioning element to be near the</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:59,480 –&gt; 00:13:06,200<br>middle rather than just arbitrarily using the first element which on average will be at the middle.</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:06,200 –&gt; 00:13:11,240<br>So one thing that we can do is sample the items and then take a median of the sample.</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:12,680 –&gt; 00:13:19,560<br>And that’s actually not worth the cost for large samples usually but for three it’s</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:19,560 –&gt; 00:13:26,120<br>worthwhile. Slightly reduces the number of compares. Increases the number of exchanges paradoxically</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:26,120 –&gt; 00:13:33,320<br>because more exchanges are required when the partitioning is right in the middle. So that’ll also</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:33,320 –&gt; 00:13:44,200<br>improve the running time by maybe 10%. So this is a summary of the optimized quicksort with cut off</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:44,200 –&gt; 00:13:51,639<br>the small sub-files and median of three partitioning. So partition usually happens pretty close to the</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:51,639 –&gt; 00:13:59,000<br>middle when you do that sample in median of three and then small sub-files can just be left</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:59,000 –&gt; 00:14:05,480<br>unsorted to be picked up with insertion sort right at the end. So this gives a feeling for the</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:05,480 –&gt; 00:14:11,559<br>number of items that have to be touched during quicksort in kind of an explanation for how it gets</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:11,559 –&gt; 00:14:18,519<br>the sort done so quickly. That’s a summary of quicksort our best sorting algorithm that we’ve seen</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:18,519 –&gt; 00:14:20,600<br>today.</p>
