                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,880<br>Now we’ll look at Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs with non-negative</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,880 –&gt; 00:00:11,880<br>edge weights.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,880 –&gt; 00:00:18,160<br>Dijkstra is a famous figure in computer science and you can amuse yourself by reading some</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,160 –&gt; 00:00:20,080<br>of the things that he wrote.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:20,080 –&gt; 00:00:28,280<br>He was a very prolific writer and kept notebooks and here really some of his famous quotes.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,280 –&gt; 00:00:33,439<br>Now you need to maybe know something about old languages to appreciate some of these.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:33,439 –&gt; 00:00:40,280<br>For example, Kobal was one of the first business-oriented languages, programming languages.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:40,280 –&gt; 00:00:48,079<br>And it tried to make it so that programs kind of read like English language sentences.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:48,079 –&gt; 00:00:56,040<br>But purists in computer science such as Dijkstra really didn’t like that language as you can</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:56,039 –&gt; 00:00:57,039<br>tell.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:57,039 –&gt; 00:00:59,000<br>The use of Kobal cripples the mind.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,000 –&gt; 00:01:03,280<br>Its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:03,280 –&gt; 00:01:07,519<br>Actually, when I first came to Princeton was setting up the department here.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:07,519 –&gt; 00:01:13,799<br>One of, there was a big donor who actually wanted to have me fired in the department close</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:13,799 –&gt; 00:01:16,480<br>down because we wouldn’t teach Kobal.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:16,480 –&gt; 00:01:21,640<br>I didn’t know about Dijkstra’s quote at that time I wish I had.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:21,640 –&gt; 00:01:25,000<br>And there’s some other opinions that Dijkstra had.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:25,000 –&gt; 00:01:29,519<br>You can amuse yourself on the web reading some of his writings.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:29,519 –&gt; 00:01:35,879<br>But he was, here’s another one that’s actually pretty relevant today.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:35,879 –&gt; 00:01:40,319<br>Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which only could have originated</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:40,319 –&gt; 00:01:42,799<br>in California.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:42,799 –&gt; 00:01:53,560<br>Dijkstra worked in Texas University of Texas for a while and of course came from the Netherlands.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:53,560 –&gt; 00:02:03,120<br>But Dijkstra did invent a very, very important algorithm that’s very widely used for solving</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:03,120 –&gt; 00:02:05,359<br>the shortest paths problem.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:05,359 –&gt; 00:02:12,640<br>It’s the one that’s in your maps app and in your car and many, many other applications.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:12,640 –&gt; 00:02:15,480<br>So let’s take a look at how that algorithm works.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:15,480 –&gt; 00:02:18,840<br>It’s a very simple algorithm.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:18,840 –&gt; 00:02:26,039<br>We consider what we’re going to do is consider the vertices in increasing order of their distance</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:26,039 –&gt; 00:02:28,719<br>from the source.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:28,719 –&gt; 00:02:35,360<br>So in the way we’re going to do that is take the next vertex, add it to the tree and relax</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:35,360 –&gt; 00:02:39,759<br>all the edges that point from that vertex.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:39,759 –&gt; 00:02:47,680<br>So let’s talk about it in terms of a demo and then we’ll look at the code.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:47,680 –&gt; 00:02:55,000<br>So our mandate is to consider vertices in increasing order of distance from the source.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:55,000 –&gt; 00:02:58,120<br>So our source is zero in this case.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:58,120 –&gt; 00:03:03,319<br>So what vertices are closest to the source?</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:03,319 –&gt; 00:03:10,159<br>Well we can look at the edges that point from that vertex.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:10,159 –&gt; 00:03:15,280<br>Well start out with vertex is zero is at distance zero from the source so we pick it.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:15,280 –&gt; 00:03:20,560<br>And then we add that vertex to the shortest pass tree and relax all its edges.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:20,560 –&gt; 00:03:26,240<br>And relaxing all the edges, pointing from zero in this case is just going to update this</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:26,240 –&gt; 00:03:30,759<br>two and edge two entries for 589.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:30,759 –&gt; 00:03:39,479<br>So in this case this says that the shortest path from zero to one is to go along zero</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:39,479 –&gt; 00:03:42,919<br>one and it’s distance five from zero to four.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:42,919 –&gt; 00:03:47,399<br>It’s go along zero four and that’s distance nine and zero to seven.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:47,399 –&gt; 00:03:51,120<br>Let’s go take a zero seven that’s distance eight.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:51,120 –&gt; 00:03:53,799<br>And the edge weights are positive.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:53,799 –&gt; 00:04:02,079<br>We’re not going to find a shorter path to anyone of the sorry the edge weights are positive.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:02,079 –&gt; 00:04:07,280<br>And those are the shortest paths that we know so far to those vertices.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:07,280 –&gt; 00:04:11,879<br>Now the first key point of the algorithm is take the closest one.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:11,879 –&gt; 00:04:16,560<br>If you take the closest one in this case it’s one then we know we’re not going to find a</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:16,560 –&gt; 00:04:18,560<br>shorter path to one.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:18,560 –&gt; 00:04:24,439<br>The only other way to go out of zero is to take one of these other edges and they’re longer.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:24,439 –&gt; 00:04:29,600<br>So in all the edge weights are positive so we’re not going to find a shorter way from zero</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:29,600 –&gt; 00:04:32,759<br>to one then to take the edge zero one.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:32,759 –&gt; 00:04:36,199<br>So that means that edge zero once on the shortest path tree.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:36,199 –&gt; 00:04:38,079<br>So that’s what the algorithm says.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:38,079 –&gt; 00:04:44,560<br>Take the next closest vertex to the source in this case it’s one.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:44,560 –&gt; 00:04:51,159<br>And then we’re going to add that edge that vertex to the tree and relax all the edges</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:51,159 –&gt; 00:04:52,800<br>at the point from that.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:52,800 –&gt; 00:04:57,360<br>So now both zero and one are on the tree so now let’s look at the edges pointing to that.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:57,360 –&gt; 00:04:59,800<br>And we have to relax each one of those.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:59,800 –&gt; 00:05:08,720<br>So in this case if you go from one to four then we look at four we know a path of length</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:08,720 –&gt; 00:05:15,400<br>nine and one to four doesn’t give us a shorter path so we leave that edge alone.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:15,400 –&gt; 00:05:21,519<br>One to three gives us a shorter path to three which is going to be 20 because you went</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:21,519 –&gt; 00:05:27,160<br>from zero to one and then one to three is of length 20 and one to two also we didn’t</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:27,160 –&gt; 00:05:36,080<br>know a way to two and now we know one or better one is 17 so that completes the relaxation</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:36,080 –&gt; 00:05:39,360<br>of all the edges pointing from one.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:39,360 –&gt; 00:05:49,200<br>So now we have zero and one on the tree and we would consider next the next closest vertex</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:49,200 –&gt; 00:05:50,560<br>to the source.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:50,560 –&gt; 00:05:57,120<br>So what we have in this two is the shortest path to all the vertices that we see in</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:57,160 –&gt; 00:06:05,759<br>so far and this one says that the and we’ve been to zero and one so the next closest one</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:05,759 –&gt; 00:06:11,560<br>is seven which is distance eight so we’re going to choose vertex seven.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:11,560 –&gt; 00:06:16,519<br>And again that’s the shortest path we’ve seen so far we’re not going to find a shorter</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:16,519 –&gt; 00:06:22,439<br>one because to get to every other vertex is longer and so we know it’s on the shortest</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:22,519 –&gt; 00:06:29,000<br>path tree and now we’re going to relax all the edges pointing from seven.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:29,000 –&gt; 00:06:35,000<br>In this case both of them the one from seven to two gives us a shorter way to two than</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:35,000 –&gt; 00:06:40,000<br>what we knew before and the one from seven to five gives us a shorter way to five than</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:40,000 –&gt; 00:06:41,000<br>we knew before.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:41,000 –&gt; 00:06:45,800<br>Well we hadn’t been to five before so that relaxes seven so now seven’s on the shortest</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:45,800 –&gt; 00:06:48,160<br>path tree.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:48,160 –&gt; 00:06:56,160<br>So now four is the next closest path for text to the source from the edge zero four which</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:56,160 –&gt; 00:07:00,160<br>is a length nine so that’s the one we’re going to pick next for the tree we’re not going</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:00,160 –&gt; 00:07:06,600<br>to find a shorter path there and we relax along all its edges.</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:06,600 –&gt; 00:07:12,680<br>In this case we find a shorter path to five than we knew before and a shorter path to</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:12,680 –&gt; 00:07:16,079<br>six well we visit six for the first time.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:16,079 –&gt; 00:07:24,240<br>Okay so that’s four so now we just have to worry about two three five and six and five</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:24,240 –&gt; 00:07:30,720<br>is the winner there so we select vertex five relax along its edges.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:30,720 –&gt; 00:07:37,480<br>In this case those edges both give us better paths than we knew before so now we’re left</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:37,560 –&gt; 00:07:44,560<br>with three vertices and two is the winner this is the two from the sources 14 to three</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:44,560 –&gt; 00:07:48,000<br>it’s 20 and six is 26.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:48,000 –&gt; 00:07:55,160<br>We relax its edges and it gives us again new shorter paths to both three and six and</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:55,160 –&gt; 00:08:03,879<br>then the next the last step is to pick three and that does not give us a new way to six</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:03,959 –&gt; 00:08:13,600<br>and then finally we pick six and then we now know the shortest paths to all the vertices</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:13,600 –&gt; 00:08:23,439<br>from vertex zero if we just take the edge two edges that’s from one to one you take zero</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:23,439 –&gt; 00:08:29,759<br>to five you take two and so forth you get the shortest paths tree and that gives the shortest</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:29,759 –&gt; 00:08:36,759<br>way to get from the source to every vertex that’s the simulation of dikesters algorithm.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:36,759 –&gt; 00:08:45,759<br>Here’s a demo of dikesters algorithm running in a large digraph so the source is the vertex</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:46,600 –&gt; 00:08:53,399<br>in the center with the open circle and you can see it considers the vertices in the graph</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:53,399 –&gt; 00:08:57,600<br>in order of their distance from the source.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:57,600 –&gt; 00:09:03,399<br>Now you can see this is maybe like a lake in the middle of the graph and so it’s not</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:03,399 –&gt; 00:09:07,720<br>going to move on from those vertices it’s going to take a little while to get around the</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:07,720 –&gt; 00:09:14,720<br>lake and again if this visualization is produced by our code and it gives a very natural feeling</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:14,720 –&gt; 00:09:21,720<br>for the way that the algorithm works.</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:21,720 –&gt; 00:09:28,720<br>This in principle and I think in fact in many cases is what your tar does when you turn</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:28,720 –&gt; 00:09:33,720<br>the map system on, computes the shortest path everywhere and then it’s already when you ask</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:33,720 –&gt; 00:09:37,720<br>for a certain place how to get there.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:37,720 –&gt; 00:09:44,720<br>So he’s just starting from another point in the graph.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:44,720 –&gt; 00:09:53,720<br>If you happen to live at a corner of the earth then it’s going to be slightly longer to get</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:53,720 –&gt; 00:10:00,720<br>to the other corner and a nice feeling for how the algorithm gets its job done.</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:00,720 –&gt; 00:10:05,720<br>Again when it gets into those blank areas it takes a little while to get it over to the</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:05,720 –&gt; 00:10:12,720<br>other side.</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:12,720 –&gt; 00:10:17,120<br>And of course if we had islands, if we had little roads in the middle there that we’re not</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:17,120 –&gt; 00:10:22,720<br>connected there would be no way to get to them from the source and we wouldn’t see them.</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:22,720 –&gt; 00:10:26,960<br>And that’s fine for the way our algorithm works we just leave that out of the demo and</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:26,960 –&gt; 00:10:33,960<br>approve to avoid adding an extra comment about that for every algorithm.</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:33,960 –&gt; 00:10:40,960<br>That’s a visualization of a Dijkstra’s algorithm on a large graph.</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:40,960 –&gt; 00:10:49,960<br>So how do we prove it’s correct? Well essentially we prove that it’s an instance of the generic algorithm.</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:49,960 –&gt; 00:10:56,960<br>So first thing is that every edge is relaxed exactly once.</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:56,960 –&gt; 00:11:05,960<br>Every time we put a vertex onto the tree we relax all the edges that come from that vertex and we never reconsider the vertex.</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:05,960 –&gt; 00:11:12,960<br>And what does relaxation do? Relaxation ensures that after the relaxation,</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:12,960 –&gt; 00:11:19,960<br>the way that was before, afterwards you have the distance to W is less than or equal to the distance to V plus</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:19,960 –&gt; 00:11:31,960<br>the way to the edge. Either it’s equal because we just made it that way or it’s less because it was before and the edge is not relevant.</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:31,960 –&gt; 00:11:45,960<br>And inequality is going to hold for every edge corresponding to every edge for this two entries corresponding to every edge.</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:45,960 –&gt; 00:11:52,960<br>Because number one, the this two values are always increasing.</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:52,960 –&gt; 00:11:57,960<br>I’m sorry, they’re always decreasing.</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:57,960 –&gt; 00:12:04,960<br>The only reason we ever change this two W is to make it smaller.</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:04,960 –&gt; 00:12:09,960<br>If we find an edge that will make it bigger we ignore that edge so it’s always decreasing.</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:09,960 –&gt; 00:12:15,960<br>So when we change this two W we’re not going to make that inequality false.</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:15,960 –&gt; 00:12:18,960<br>We’re just going to make it better.</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:18,960 –&gt; 00:12:22,960<br>And this two V’s not going to change at all.</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:22,960 –&gt; 00:12:29,960<br>Once we relax an edge from a vertex, we’re done with that vertex. We’re not going to process it at all.</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:29,960 –&gt; 00:12:35,960<br>So then when we’re done we have the optimality conditions hold.</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:35,960 –&gt; 00:12:45,960<br>That exactly is the optimality condition. And not all of that, we have a path from the source to every vertex.</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:45,960 –&gt; 00:12:52,960<br>So that’s a correctness proof for dikes-trees algorithm based on the optimality conditions.</p>
<p>134<br>00:12:52,960 –&gt; 00:12:58,960<br>Here’s the code. It’s similar to code that we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>135<br>00:12:58,960 –&gt; 00:13:09,960<br>We’re going to use the indexed priority queue that allows us to implement the decrease key operation.</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:09,960 –&gt; 00:13:15,960<br>And we have our edge-do and just two arrays that are part of the Schroers-Path’s computation,</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:15,960 –&gt; 00:13:18,960<br>the goal of the Schroers-Path’s computation.</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:18,960 –&gt; 00:13:27,960<br>So we initialize the constructor, initializes those arrays including the index minimum pq.</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:27,960 –&gt; 00:13:35,960<br>And we start out with all the distances infinity except for the distance of the source is 0.</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:35,960 –&gt; 00:13:48,960<br>We put the source on the priority queue. And then what we’re going to do is take the edge that’s closest to the source off the priority,</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:48,960 –&gt; 00:13:54,960<br>that’s on the priority queue off, and then relax all the edges that are adjacent to that.</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:54,960 –&gt; 00:14:02,960<br>So I’m using our standard iterator to get all the edges that emanate from that vertex and relax them.</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:02,960 –&gt; 00:14:09,960<br>And then the relaxed code is just like the code that we showed when describing relaxation,</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:09,960 –&gt; 00:14:13,960<br>except that it also updates the priority queue.</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:13,960 –&gt; 00:14:21,960<br>If the vertex that that edge goes to is on the priority queue, it gives a new shorter way to get to that.</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:21,960 –&gt; 00:14:28,960<br>So we have to decrease the key on the priority queue. If it’s not on the priority queue, we insert it.</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:28,960 –&gt; 00:14:36,960<br>And that’s it. That’s a complete implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm using modern data structures.</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:36,960 –&gt; 00:14:40,960<br>Now this algorithm might seem very familiar if you’ve been paying attention.</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:40,960 –&gt; 00:14:45,960<br>It’s essentially the same algorithm as Prims algorithm.</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:45,960 –&gt; 00:14:52,960<br>The difference is that in both cases we’re building what’s called a spanning tree of the graph.</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:53,960 –&gt; 00:15:02,960<br>But in Prims algorithm, we take a vertex that’s not on the tree using the rule of let’s take the vertex that’s closest to the tree anywhere on the tree,</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:02,960 –&gt; 00:15:14,960<br>closest to some vertex on the tree. For Dijkstra’s algorithm, we take next the vertex that’s closest to the source through a path that goes through the tree and then into a non-tree vertex.</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:14,960 –&gt; 00:15:16,960<br>That’s the difference.</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:16,960 –&gt; 00:15:28,960<br>Now the differences in the code have to do with the fact that Prims algorithm is for an undirected graph, Dijkstra’s algorithm for a directed graph, but essentially they’re the same algorithm.</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:28,960 –&gt; 00:15:33,960<br>And actually, several of the algorithms that we’ve talked about are in the same family.</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:33,960 –&gt; 00:15:45,960<br>They compute a spanning tree. You have a tree that takes care of where that records where you’ve been in the graph from every vertex back to where you started.</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:46,960 –&gt; 00:16:03,960<br>And they use different rules for choosing what’s vertex to add next. For breadth for search, you use a queue. For depth for search, you use something like a stack and then you just have to decide what to do if you encounter vertex you’ve been to before.</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:03,960 –&gt; 00:16:09,960<br>But many graph algorithms use this same basic idea.</p>
<p>159<br>00:16:09,960 –&gt; 00:16:23,960<br>So in particular, when we’re talking about what the running time of Dijkstra’s algorithm depends on what priority queue implementation we use in the same considerations as for Prims algorithm.</p>
<p>160<br>00:16:23,960 –&gt; 00:16:39,960<br>We have V insert operations. Every vertex goes on to the priority queue. V delete min. Every vertex comes off the priority queue. And for every edge in the worst case, we could compute a decreased key operation.</p>
<p>161<br>00:16:40,960 –&gt; 00:16:58,960<br>So the original implementations of Dijkstra’s algorithm used in an ordered array, which would mean that it would take time proportional to V to find the minimum to find the vertex closest to the source.</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:58,960 –&gt; 00:17:16,960<br>So the total running time be proportional to V squared. That’s not adequate for the huge sparse graphs that we see in practice today, like the map in your car. So the binary heap data structure makes it feasible to run this algorithm.</p>
<p>163<br>00:17:16,960 –&gt; 00:17:32,960<br>And that’s where all the operations take time proportional to log V. We have to use the indexing trick that we talked about last time to support decreased key. But still we get a total running time of E log V, which makes it feasible.</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:32,960 –&gt; 00:17:47,960<br>And just as with Prims algorithm by using an implementation of the priority queue that can do a faster decreased key, you can get a faster algorithm.</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:47,960 –&gt; 00:18:02,960<br>And in practice, something like a four-way heap is going to give quite a fast algorithm. That’s a more expensive to insert and to insert, but much faster to a delete min and decrease key.</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:02,960 –&gt; 00:18:11,960<br>And again, there’s a theoretical data structure that’s not useful in practice that gets the running time down to E plus V log V.</p>
<p>167<br>00:18:11,960 –&gt; 00:18:26,960<br>Of course, if your graph is dense, and again, the examples I use, they’re not. The array implementation is optimal. You can’t do any better. You have to go through all the edges. You might as well find the minimum at the same time.</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:26,960 –&gt; 00:18:38,960<br>But in practice, people use binary heaps for sparse graphs. And maybe going to four-way if the performance is really critical.</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:38,960 –&gt; 00:18:48,960<br>The bottom line is we have extremely efficient implementations for the huge graphs that arise in practice nowadays.</p>
