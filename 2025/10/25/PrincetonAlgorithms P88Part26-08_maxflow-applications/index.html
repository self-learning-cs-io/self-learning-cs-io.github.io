                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:10,480<br>Let’s finish up by looking at some applications of max flow.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:10,480 –&gt; 00:00:16,600<br>Like shortest paths, max flow is a very widely applicable problem solving model.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,600 –&gt; 00:00:19,960<br>This is really important to recognize at this stage.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,960 –&gt; 00:00:23,960<br>We’ve looked at a lot of algorithms for solving specific problems and they’re important</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,960 –&gt; 00:00:27,920<br>problems and it’s important to have efficient algorithms for solving them.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:27,920 –&gt; 00:00:34,640<br>But when you have something like max flow or shortest paths, the importance that we attach</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:34,640 –&gt; 00:00:41,560<br>to them is really magnified by the idea that they have this property that if they’re a</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:41,560 –&gt; 00:00:49,240<br>very general way to state a problem and we have many, many practical situations that we</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:49,240 –&gt; 00:00:53,079<br>can cast in terms of these problems.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:53,079 –&gt; 00:00:59,039<br>We looked at arbitrage, reducing down to a shortest paths problem and we’ll look at a</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:59,039 –&gt; 00:01:03,599<br>bunch of problems that don’t seem to be related at all that can be modeled as max flow</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:03,599 –&gt; 00:01:04,879<br>problems.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:04,879 –&gt; 00:01:12,159<br>So they’re extremely important because they’re problem solving models that work for a broad</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:12,159 –&gt; 00:01:14,439<br>variety of important applications.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:14,439 –&gt; 00:01:19,359<br>Number one, that wouldn’t be any good if we didn’t have efficient algorithms for solving them.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:19,359 –&gt; 00:01:24,319<br>But we do have efficient algorithms for solving them and so that magnifies their importance.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:24,319 –&gt; 00:01:30,280<br>And that’s why people work so hard on finding efficient algorithms for solving these problems</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:30,280 –&gt; 00:01:33,359<br>and we’ll talk about that as well in a minute.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:33,359 –&gt; 00:01:41,640<br>So these are again just a few of the many, many algorithms applications of max flow.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:41,640 –&gt; 00:01:47,319<br>We saw an image processing algorithm called seam carving for shortest paths.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:47,319 –&gt; 00:01:51,279<br>There’s another one called segmentation for max flow.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:51,279 –&gt; 00:01:58,280<br>Again, if you have an image and you have one vertex per pixel, you have a huge, huge graph.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:58,280 –&gt; 00:02:04,639<br>And you have many explicit, huge graphs and we talked about those types of things.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:04,639 –&gt; 00:02:12,719<br>But there are other things where the graph is an abstraction that it gets involved in the</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:12,719 –&gt; 00:02:19,319<br>model of the abstract graph and the max flow problem is maybe a bit surprising at first.</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:19,319 –&gt; 00:02:23,960<br>And we’ll look at a couple examples of that to illustrate the point.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:23,960 –&gt; 00:02:28,000<br>Over here is a medical example having to do with it.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:28,000 –&gt; 00:02:31,280<br>That’s the image processing one on a medical example.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:31,280 –&gt; 00:02:35,639<br>Help identify some important part of a medical image.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:35,639 –&gt; 00:02:42,319<br>So we’ll look at a couple of examples to emphasize the idea of a general problem solving</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:42,319 –&gt; 00:02:49,159<br>model that once we have an efficient algorithm, then we can think about using the problem solving</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:49,159 –&gt; 00:02:50,159<br>model.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:50,159 –&gt; 00:02:57,079<br>And later on, we’ll see that this concept of a general problem solving model has really</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:57,079 –&gt; 00:03:01,759<br>profound implications and we’ll be looking at that later on.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:01,759 –&gt; 00:03:04,560<br>So let’s just look at a couple of examples.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:04,560 –&gt; 00:03:09,639<br>Here’s one called the bipartite matching problem.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:09,639 –&gt; 00:03:16,919<br>So you have this is a bit of an idealized situation but it works in more messy real life situations</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:16,919 –&gt; 00:03:17,919<br>too.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:17,919 –&gt; 00:03:22,159<br>So there’s N jobs out there and N students apply for them.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:22,159 –&gt; 00:03:27,239<br>And we’ll use a small example where there’s five students and five jobs but of course in</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:27,239 –&gt; 00:03:29,919<br>the real world this can be huge.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:29,919 –&gt; 00:03:35,679<br>Now during hiring season, the students go out and apply for the jobs and they each get</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:35,679 –&gt; 00:03:38,000<br>a bunch of offers.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:38,000 –&gt; 00:03:43,479<br>So looking at it from the student’s point of view, Alice gets offers from Adobe Amazon</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:43,479 –&gt; 00:03:45,680<br>and Google.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:45,680 –&gt; 00:03:49,319<br>Adobe makes offers to Alice Bob and Carol and like that.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:49,319 –&gt; 00:03:56,599<br>So this association between students and jobs, everybody gets several offers.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:56,599 –&gt; 00:04:04,159<br>And the question is, well, would be good if everybody got a job, right?</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:04,159 –&gt; 00:04:09,240<br>And the question is, is there some way for everybody to get a job?</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:09,240 –&gt; 00:04:17,560<br>That’s called the bipartite matching problem and it comes up in lots of forms directly related</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:17,560 –&gt; 00:04:19,240<br>to graph processing.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:19,240 –&gt; 00:04:29,000<br>Now we could study and people do study algorithms for explicitly solving this particular problem.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:29,000 –&gt; 00:04:33,759<br>But what I want to emphasize is that actually max lows are reasonable model for it.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:33,759 –&gt; 00:04:37,839<br>So we can use our efficient max low implementation to get it solved.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:37,839 –&gt; 00:04:43,399<br>We don’t have to come up with a specialized algorithm for this problem.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:43,399 –&gt; 00:04:48,579<br>So in terms of graphs, it’s called a bipartite matching problem, given a bipartite graph</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:48,579 –&gt; 00:04:50,800<br>find a perfect matching.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:50,800 –&gt; 00:04:57,480<br>And a bipartite graph is one where you have two sets of vertices, in this case one corresponding</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:57,480 –&gt; 00:05:01,159<br>to students and another corresponding to companies.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:01,160 –&gt; 00:05:06,640<br>And you have every edge in the graph goes from one type of vertex to the other type of</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:06,640 –&gt; 00:05:08,280<br>vertex.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:08,280 –&gt; 00:05:17,720<br>And a matching in the graph is a set of edges that are disjoint that just connect two vertices.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:17,720 –&gt; 00:05:20,760<br>But that’s it.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:20,760 –&gt; 00:05:24,200<br>And so in this case, there’s a perfect matching.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:24,200 –&gt; 00:05:28,960<br>Works out that if Alice takes the Google job and Bob takes the Adobe job and Carol takes</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:28,959 –&gt; 00:05:33,959<br>a Facebook job and like that, then everybody gets a job.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:33,959 –&gt; 00:05:36,359<br>So that’s a perfect matching.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:36,359 –&gt; 00:05:41,839<br>But you can also have a situation where that’s not possible.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:41,839 –&gt; 00:05:45,319<br>So let’s look at how to formulate.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:45,319 –&gt; 00:05:48,000<br>The one thing is how do we find the matching?</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:48,000 –&gt; 00:05:51,560<br>And then the other thing is is there one.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:51,560 –&gt; 00:05:54,599<br>So this is easy to formulate as a network flow problem.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:54,599 –&gt; 00:05:57,039<br>That’s what this diagram shows.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:57,040 –&gt; 00:06:00,720<br>So what we’ll do is we’ll create our source and target vertices.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:00,720 –&gt; 00:06:07,480<br>We’ll have one vertex for each student, one vertex for each company in the flow network.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:07,480 –&gt; 00:06:13,280<br>And we’ll add a capacity one edge from S to each student.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:13,280 –&gt; 00:06:19,000<br>And a capacity one edge from T to T, from each company to T.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:19,000 –&gt; 00:06:26,000<br>And then it doesn’t matter what the capacity will add an infinite capacity edge from each</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:26,000 –&gt; 00:06:29,519<br>student to each job offered.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:29,519 –&gt; 00:06:33,160<br>And then we’ll ask for a maximum flow in this graph.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:33,160 –&gt; 00:06:44,160<br>So you can see that the flow every augmenting path has to go from S to a student to a company</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:44,160 –&gt; 00:06:46,160<br>to T.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:46,160 –&gt; 00:06:52,560<br>And so the flow will give us the matching.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:52,560 –&gt; 00:06:55,319<br>Let’s see how it works.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:55,319 –&gt; 00:07:01,719<br>This is a one-to-one correspondence between perfect matchings of bipartite graphs and</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:01,719 –&gt; 00:07:04,920<br>integer value max flows.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:04,920 –&gt; 00:07:15,120<br>So in this case, there’s a flow of value 5 and that flow gives us the matching immediately.</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:15,120 –&gt; 00:07:21,319<br>So what the min cut tells us if there’s a no perfect matching, explain why.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:21,319 –&gt; 00:07:28,639<br>So here’s an example that maybe could have happened with the job offers.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:28,639 –&gt; 00:07:42,519<br>And when the algorithm terminates with a cut, where a cut of the bipartite graph, which</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:42,519 –&gt; 00:07:46,319<br>separates 2, 4, 5 from 7 and 10.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:46,319 –&gt; 00:07:53,560<br>And essentially the cut tells us that students in 2, 4, 5 can only be matched to companies</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:53,560 –&gt; 00:07:54,560<br>7 and 10.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:54,560 –&gt; 00:07:59,159<br>You can see all the edges from 2, 4, 5 go to 7 and 10.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:59,159 –&gt; 00:08:01,560<br>So you have two companies in three students.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:01,560 –&gt; 00:08:06,199<br>So there’s no way that everybody can be matched.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:06,199 –&gt; 00:08:09,159<br>Somebody’s going to be left out.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:09,160 –&gt; 00:08:14,080<br>So that’s the students.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:14,080 –&gt; 00:08:18,439<br>So there’ll be a min cut and the s will be the students on the s side and t will be the</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:18,439 –&gt; 00:08:20,600<br>companies on the s side.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:20,600 –&gt; 00:08:25,440<br>And if it’s bigger than s is bigger than t, then you can’t have a matching.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:25,440 –&gt; 00:08:32,360<br>So in this case, there’s only four jobs and somebody’s going to be left out.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:32,360 –&gt; 00:08:38,440<br>It’s also interesting to trace through what happens with the max flow algorithm on bipartite</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:38,440 –&gt; 00:08:41,120<br>graphs like this.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:41,120 –&gt; 00:08:47,200<br>Essentially augmenting paths or usually forward edges makes some matchings.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:47,200 –&gt; 00:08:55,000<br>And then if it’s possible to find a path that undoes some matching, it zigzags through</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:55,000 –&gt; 00:09:01,840<br>undoing matchings and trying other ones to find a way through to the target.</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:01,840 –&gt; 00:09:09,000<br>But if there’s no perfect matching, there’ll be a min cut and that one will explain why.</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:09,000 –&gt; 00:09:15,240<br>So that’s a problem, the bipartite matching problem, that we can model as a max flow algorithm</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:15,240 –&gt; 00:09:19,960<br>and just use our existing code to solve it.</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:19,960 –&gt; 00:09:22,160<br>Here’s another one that’s even further away.</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:22,160 –&gt; 00:09:27,360<br>It doesn’t seem to have a graph at all, but it does.</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:27,360 –&gt; 00:09:31,000<br>It’s called a baseball elimination problem.</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:31,000 –&gt; 00:09:40,639<br>This is again, just to show the breadth of applicability of the max flow model.</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:40,639 –&gt; 00:09:45,960<br>And it’s interesting at certain times you’re getting near the end of the baseball season.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:45,960 –&gt; 00:09:52,240<br>And often you’ll hear on the news, you see in the paper or see on the web that your team</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:52,240 –&gt; 00:09:56,080<br>is mathematically eliminated.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:56,080 –&gt; 00:10:01,879<br>Usually most of the time they don’t really get that right because they don’t do the</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:01,879 –&gt; 00:10:05,440<br>computation that we’re going to talk about next.</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:05,440 –&gt; 00:10:06,879<br>Sometimes it’s easy.</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:06,879 –&gt; 00:10:09,840<br>This is an example where it’s easy.</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:09,840 –&gt; 00:10:12,680<br>So we’ve got four teams.</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:12,680 –&gt; 00:10:15,879<br>They already have this win-loss record.</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:15,879 –&gt; 00:10:19,400<br>And this is the number of games to play.</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:19,399 –&gt; 00:10:27,360<br>So in this case, Montréal has only three games to play.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:27,360 –&gt; 00:10:32,720<br>So the best they could do is win 80.</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:32,720 –&gt; 00:10:36,919<br>But Atlanta’s already got 83 wins, so there’s no way Montréal is going to win.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:36,919 –&gt; 00:10:41,079<br>So that’s a mathematical elimination that anyone can figure out.</p>
<p>129<br>00:10:41,079 –&gt; 00:10:46,159<br>Usually in Newspaper we’ll get that one right.</p>
<p>130<br>00:10:46,159 –&gt; 00:10:49,039<br>But sometimes it’s more complicated.</p>
<p>131<br>00:10:49,039 –&gt; 00:10:51,319<br>Phil, let’s say this case.</p>
<p>132<br>00:10:51,319 –&gt; 00:10:56,959<br>So Philly has 80 wins, three games to play.</p>
<p>133<br>00:10:56,959 –&gt; 00:11:00,519<br>So the best they can do is 83 wins.</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:00,519 –&gt; 00:11:02,959<br>So that’s interesting.</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:02,959 –&gt; 00:11:11,799<br>But the thing is that Atlanta has a bunch of games against, it’s got six games against</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:11,799 –&gt; 00:11:13,720<br>the mats.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:13,720 –&gt; 00:11:19,279<br>And either Atlanta wins one of them, which would give Atlanta 84 wins, or the mats win</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:19,279 –&gt; 00:11:25,240<br>all of them, in which case they get 84 wins, either way Philly, Dalfias mathematically</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:25,240 –&gt; 00:11:26,879<br>eliminated.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:26,879 –&gt; 00:11:33,519<br>That’s a bit more complicated decision about which team wins.</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:33,519 –&gt; 00:11:39,200<br>The thing is, and there’s many more complicated situations that show up.</p>
<p>142<br>00:11:39,200 –&gt; 00:11:45,160<br>And the observation just from these two easy examples is that you can’t figure out who’s</p>
<p>143<br>00:11:45,160 –&gt; 00:11:50,920<br>mathematically eliminated without knowing the full schedule of games.</p>
<p>144<br>00:11:50,920 –&gt; 00:11:55,280<br>It depends not only on how many games have already won, how many are left to play, but</p>
<p>145<br>00:11:55,280 –&gt; 00:11:59,879<br>it depends on the schedule and who’s playing who.</p>
<p>146<br>00:11:59,879 –&gt; 00:12:06,600<br>And usually your average sports writer is not going to do that computation without a computer.</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:06,600 –&gt; 00:12:12,840<br>I hope that one of you becomes a sports writer and puts us in for the future for us.</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:12,840 –&gt; 00:12:16,240<br>So let’s look at a more complicated situation.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:16,240 –&gt; 00:12:24,519<br>So this is the American League East a while ago, near the end of the season.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:24,519 –&gt; 00:12:31,440<br>The question is, which teams are mathematically eliminated and which ones aren’t?</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:31,440 –&gt; 00:12:41,160<br>Now in this case, it turns out that this is pretty far from the end of the season actually,</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:41,160 –&gt; 00:12:44,320<br>this 27 games to finish.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:44,320 –&gt; 00:12:52,640<br>And this is a proof here that Detroit is mathematically eliminated, but it’s a pretty complicated</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:52,639 –&gt; 00:12:53,639<br>argument.</p>
<p>155<br>00:12:53,639 –&gt; 00:13:00,679<br>And well, you can reason it out with arithmetic.</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:00,679 –&gt; 00:13:07,319<br>The tough part is to figure out the set of teams here are.</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:07,319 –&gt; 00:13:11,960<br>So what we’re going to see is that you can do a max low computation to figure out this</p>
<p>158<br>00:13:11,960 –&gt; 00:13:12,960<br>set of teams.</p>
<p>159<br>00:13:12,960 –&gt; 00:13:16,559<br>And let’s just look at it for this example.</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:16,559 –&gt; 00:13:21,120<br>So at this point, Detroit is mathematically eliminated.</p>
<p>161<br>00:13:21,120 –&gt; 00:13:31,840<br>And so it’s got 27 games to play, so it could, in theory, win 76 of the games.</p>
<p>162<br>00:13:31,840 –&gt; 00:13:40,519<br>Now the logic that will convince you that they are eliminated is that if you take the four</p>
<p>163<br>00:13:40,519 –&gt; 00:13:50,320<br>teams, the other four teams and add up all their wins, there’s 278 of them.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:50,320 –&gt; 00:13:56,280<br>When you look at the remaining games, there’s 27, so somebody’s got to win every one of those</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:56,280 –&gt; 00:13:57,600<br>games.</p>
<p>166<br>00:13:57,600 –&gt; 00:14:05,960<br>The total number of games won for that set of teams is 305.</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:05,960 –&gt; 00:14:11,280<br>And if you divide by four, it means the average is 76.25.</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:11,280 –&gt; 00:14:17,920<br>And right there is a proof that one of them has got to win 77 games.</p>
<p>169<br>00:14:17,919 –&gt; 00:14:24,159<br>That takes a little thought, but if you have the four teams, then from the remaining games,</p>
<p>170<br>00:14:24,159 –&gt; 00:14:28,319<br>you can figure out that Detroit is mathematically eliminated.</p>
<p>171<br>00:14:28,319 –&gt; 00:14:31,559<br>But the key is how do we find those four teams?</p>
<p>172<br>00:14:31,559 –&gt; 00:14:36,919<br>And the answer, as I’ve already said, is it’s max flow.</p>
<p>173<br>00:14:36,919 –&gt; 00:14:45,439<br>And so this is a max flow network that can be used to solve the baseball elimination problem.</p>
<p>174<br>00:14:45,440 –&gt; 00:14:54,520<br>So the intuition is that you have a source vertex, and you have what happens in the remaining</p>
<p>175<br>00:14:54,520 –&gt; 00:15:01,280<br>games flowing from the source to the target.</p>
<p>176<br>00:15:01,280 –&gt; 00:15:08,140<br>So here we’re trying to prove that team four is, we’re trying to decide if team four is</p>
<p>177<br>00:15:08,140 –&gt; 00:15:09,140<br>eliminated or not.</p>
<p>178<br>00:15:09,140 –&gt; 00:15:11,720<br>That’s Detroit in this case.</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:11,720 –&gt; 00:15:17,960<br>And so what we need is a vertex for each pair of vertices that are not the team we’re interested</p>
<p>180<br>00:15:17,960 –&gt; 00:15:19,460<br>in.</p>
<p>181<br>00:15:19,460 –&gt; 00:15:26,160<br>And so that’s going to relate to all the remaining games between the other pairs of teams.</p>
<p>182<br>00:15:26,160 –&gt; 00:15:32,279<br>And then you have an edge from the source to each one of those vertices.</p>
<p>183<br>00:15:32,279 –&gt; 00:15:38,480<br>And the capacity of the edge is the number of games left between those two.</p>
<p>184<br>00:15:38,480 –&gt; 00:15:41,000<br>So that’s on one end.</p>
<p>185<br>00:15:41,000 –&gt; 00:15:44,679<br>And then you have a vertex for each team.</p>
<p>186<br>00:15:44,679 –&gt; 00:15:51,399<br>And then what we do for each one of these pair vertices, we put infinite capacity edges</p>
<p>187<br>00:15:51,399 –&gt; 00:15:54,000<br>to the two teams involved.</p>
<p>188<br>00:15:54,000 –&gt; 00:15:58,360<br>So the flow is going to be an integer flow, and some of it will go one way, and some of</p>
<p>189<br>00:15:58,360 –&gt; 00:16:00,559<br>it will go the other way.</p>
<p>190<br>00:16:00,559 –&gt; 00:16:06,759<br>But then for each of the teams, what we’re going to do is make sure that they don’t win</p>
<p>191<br>00:16:06,759 –&gt; 00:16:11,960<br>more games than team four that team we’re interested in.</p>
<p>192<br>00:16:11,960 –&gt; 00:16:17,480<br>So we’ll put this upper bound on the flow here that we will let the number of wins get</p>
<p>193<br>00:16:17,480 –&gt; 00:16:24,039<br>better than what our team of interest team four can do.</p>
<p>194<br>00:16:24,039 –&gt; 00:16:33,480<br>And the fact is that if you compute a max flow of this, you can convince yourself that if</p>
<p>195<br>00:16:33,480 –&gt; 00:16:42,039<br>you can fill this network up going from S in the max flow, then team four is not going</p>
<p>196<br>00:16:42,039 –&gt; 00:16:43,560<br>to be eliminated.</p>
<p>197<br>00:16:43,560 –&gt; 00:16:47,399<br>Nobody’s going to get more wins than team four.</p>
<p>198<br>00:16:47,399 –&gt; 00:16:54,800<br>And so the way to solve the baseball elimination problem is to run max flow on this network.</p>
<p>199<br>00:16:54,800 –&gt; 00:17:01,240<br>And the men cut will give the set of teams, sorry, men cut will give the set of teams that</p>
<p>200<br>00:17:01,240 –&gt; 00:17:07,720<br>you needed in this calculation to figure out, to prove to a friend or to a sports writer</p>
<p>201<br>00:17:07,720 –&gt; 00:17:12,319<br>that the team you’re interested in is eliminated.</p>
<p>202<br>00:17:12,319 –&gt; 00:17:14,960<br>An interesting application of max flow.</p>
<p>203<br>00:17:14,960 –&gt; 00:17:20,400<br>And again, we just take our problem, use it to build a network, solve the problem on</p>
<p>204<br>00:17:20,400 –&gt; 00:17:28,400<br>the network using our existing code, and translate that solution to our original problem.</p>
<p>205<br>00:17:28,400 –&gt; 00:17:32,240<br>This is called reduction and it’s a very important technique that we’re going to use.</p>
<p>206<br>00:17:32,240 –&gt; 00:17:37,160<br>I’m going to talk about in some detail later on.</p>
<p>207<br>00:17:37,160 –&gt; 00:17:42,519<br>So now we come to the theory of max flow algorithms.</p>
<p>208<br>00:17:42,519 –&gt; 00:17:50,519<br>This is an even hotter area than minimum spanish, short as fast that we’ve looked at before</p>
<p>209<br>00:17:50,519 –&gt; 00:17:56,880<br>in that it’s a very frustrating situation for theoretical computer scientists in that</p>
<p>210<br>00:17:56,880 –&gt; 00:18:01,960<br>we have this relatively straightforward to state algorithm.</p>
<p>211<br>00:18:01,960 –&gt; 00:18:06,520<br>And we have this all designed freedom, the forward focus in algorithm is lots and lots</p>
<p>212<br>00:18:06,520 –&gt; 00:18:10,600<br>of ways that we could try to find augmenting paths.</p>
<p>213<br>00:18:10,600 –&gt; 00:18:18,360<br>And there’s even other methods that don’t use forward focus in that are almost as simple.</p>
<p>214<br>00:18:18,360 –&gt; 00:18:24,120<br>And the question is how difficult is it to solve the max flow problem?</p>
<p>215<br>00:18:24,119 –&gt; 00:18:28,959<br>And there’s literally hundreds of papers in the scientific literature that are oriented</p>
<p>216<br>00:18:28,959 –&gt; 00:18:31,399<br>at trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>217<br>00:18:31,399 –&gt; 00:18:40,279<br>Now again, theoretical computer scientists are trying to find an algorithm that’s guaranteed</p>
<p>218<br>00:18:40,279 –&gt; 00:18:42,599<br>to work well in the worst case.</p>
<p>219<br>00:18:42,599 –&gt; 00:18:48,279<br>So they’re just counting the number of edges that the algorithms examine in the worst case.</p>
<p>220<br>00:18:48,680 –&gt; 00:18:55,480<br>When related to practical graphs, these are very, very conservative upper bounds.</p>
<p>221<br>00:18:55,480 –&gt; 00:18:58,279<br>And the real performance is going to be totally different.</p>
<p>222<br>00:18:58,279 –&gt; 00:19:02,519<br>So you can’t use these to compare the performance of given algorithms.</p>
<p>223<br>00:19:02,519 –&gt; 00:19:08,319<br>The performance of given algorithms really depends on the characteristic of network.</p>
<p>224<br>00:19:08,319 –&gt; 00:19:14,240<br>But still there’s a huge gap between the best algorithms that we know.</p>
<p>225<br>00:19:14,240 –&gt; 00:19:22,279<br>And the most recent one was discovered just this year that can guarantee e squared over log</p>
<p>226<br>00:19:22,279 –&gt; 00:19:27,759<br>e number of edges examine to try to find the max flow.</p>
<p>227<br>00:19:27,759 –&gt; 00:19:38,720<br>And so that’s fine, but that’s a huge gap between and very small compared to say shortest</p>
<p>228<br>00:19:38,720 –&gt; 00:19:43,559<br>augmenting path, which is e cubed essentially.</p>
<p>229<br>00:19:43,559 –&gt; 00:19:50,640<br>And that’s fine, but actually in practice, the running time of many of the algorithms seems</p>
<p>230<br>00:19:50,640 –&gt; 00:19:54,360<br>to be relatively small factor of e.</p>
<p>231<br>00:19:54,360 –&gt; 00:19:58,559<br>And no one can prove that there might not exist an algorithm.</p>
<p>232<br>00:19:58,559 –&gt; 00:20:04,559<br>No one has proved yet that there might not exist an algorithm that gets the job done in linear</p>
<p>233<br>00:20:04,559 –&gt; 00:20:05,559<br>time.</p>
<p>234<br>00:20:05,559 –&gt; 00:20:11,480<br>So I want to be exciting things about studying the field of algorithms is there’s still room</p>
<p>235<br>00:20:11,480 –&gt; 00:20:19,240<br>to find, to discover interesting and innovative algorithms that could have a huge practical impact.</p>
<p>236<br>00:20:19,240 –&gt; 00:20:25,759<br>Because we have algorithms that one run well on practical networks, lots and lots of important</p>
<p>237<br>00:20:25,759 –&gt; 00:20:27,639<br>practical applications use them.</p>
<p>238<br>00:20:27,639 –&gt; 00:20:34,240<br>And if someone were to discover a fast practical guaranteed linear time algorithm,</p>
<p>239<br>00:20:34,240 –&gt; 00:20:38,759<br>they would immediately have huge impact.</p>
<p>240<br>00:20:38,759 –&gt; 00:20:44,319<br>So that’s the first warning with the worst case sort of growth.</p>
<p>241<br>00:20:44,319 –&gt; 00:20:48,240<br>You’re not going to compare algorithms in practice.</p>
<p>242<br>00:20:48,240 –&gt; 00:20:54,160<br>And there’s plenty of research papers out there that have done empirical studies on the</p>
<p>243<br>00:20:54,160 –&gt; 00:21:03,759<br>max flow algorithm for realistic networks in the so-called best so far in practice, as</p>
<p>244<br>00:21:03,759 –&gt; 00:21:09,319<br>you’ve noticed, the push relabel method with gap relabeling, which runs in time e2v,</p>
<p>245<br>00:21:09,319 –&gt; 00:21:11,279<br>where e is a number of edges.</p>
<p>246<br>00:21:11,279 –&gt; 00:21:19,000<br>And again, even that in practical networks is going to run faster than that.</p>
<p>247<br>00:21:19,000 –&gt; 00:21:24,359<br>So there’s numerous research challenges still to be addressed in studying the max flow problem.</p>
<p>248<br>00:21:24,359 –&gt; 00:21:30,640<br>There’s plenty of practitioners that are using codes like the ones that we’ve shown and</p>
<p>249<br>00:21:30,640 –&gt; 00:21:37,759<br>variations to try to solve huge real max flow and cut problems and try to get them done</p>
<p>250<br>00:21:37,759 –&gt; 00:21:39,720<br>in linear time.</p>
<p>251<br>00:21:39,720 –&gt; 00:21:45,520<br>There’s many theoretical computer scientists that are trying to prove that there exists or</p>
<p>252<br>00:21:45,520 –&gt; 00:21:51,200<br>not exists a max flow algorithm that is guaranteed to run in linear time, no matter what the</p>
<p>253<br>00:21:51,200 –&gt; 00:21:52,200<br>input.</p>
<p>254<br>00:21:52,200 –&gt; 00:21:57,680<br>There’s many, many people doing research and there’s still a great deal to be learned.</p>
<p>255<br>00:21:57,680 –&gt; 00:22:02,880<br>So a fine example of why it’s exciting to be working in the field of algorithms.</p>
<p>256<br>00:22:02,880 –&gt; 00:22:10,480<br>There’s opportunity for new knowledge still available and many people still working on them.</p>
