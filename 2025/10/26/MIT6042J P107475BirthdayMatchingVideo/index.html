                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,000<br>Now you may remember a discussion of the birthday paradox, which says that if you have a group</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,000 –&gt; 00:00:16,399<br>of 27 random people, the probability is almost two thirds that some two of them are going</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,399 –&gt; 00:00:22,960<br>to have a matching birthday, even though there are 365 birthdays in the year, and you might</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:22,960 –&gt; 00:00:30,039<br>simply think that with 27 people there’d only be a 27 out of 365 or some chance like that,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:30,039 –&gt; 00:00:32,120<br>it’s actually two thirds.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:32,120 –&gt; 00:00:37,120<br>And by the time you get to a class of 110, which is what we’ll be, we have data for and</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,120 –&gt; 00:00:41,760<br>we’re going to be looking at, it turns out that the odds are almost three quarters of a</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:41,760 –&gt; 00:00:46,719<br>million to one that you’ll have a couple of people with matching birthdays.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,719 –&gt; 00:00:50,320<br>So let’s look at the matching birthday problem a little bit more today.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:50,320 –&gt; 00:00:54,320<br>And the reason we’re looking at it is because it’s a lovely example where there really</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:54,320 –&gt; 00:00:58,039<br>is pairwise independence and not mutual independence.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:58,039 –&gt; 00:01:04,359<br>So it’s reinforcing the key idea behind the additivity of variance and the pairwise independence</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:04,359 –&gt; 00:01:05,359<br>sampling theorem.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:05,359 –&gt; 00:01:08,599<br>We’re not going to use the sampling theorem here, but just pairwise independence, but it’s</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,599 –&gt; 00:01:09,599<br>worth looking at.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:09,599 –&gt; 00:01:13,920<br>Now before I go further, let me mention that this, the birthday problem is just what we’re</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:13,920 –&gt; 00:01:21,200<br>doing for fun, but in fact, it has some real applications in, within one area, but the</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:21,200 –&gt; 00:01:25,760<br>most famous one is the so-called birthday attack on a crypto system, which involves being</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:25,760 –&gt; 00:01:32,480<br>able to search for matching pairs of keys with a relatively small sample.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:32,480 –&gt; 00:01:36,320<br>And you’re very likely to find at least some two that match.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:36,320 –&gt; 00:01:43,320<br>So with that motivation claimed, but not examined, let’s just go back to thinking about birthdays.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:44,319 –&gt; 00:01:49,599<br>So let’s suppose that I have some group of N people and there are D days in the year just</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:49,599 –&gt; 00:01:55,000<br>to keep the parameters abstract and not get too stuck on the numbers, keeping the parameters,</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:55,000 –&gt; 00:01:57,519<br>makes it actually a bit clearer to reason about.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:57,519 –&gt; 00:02:04,039<br>So we’re implicitly assuming here that each person is kind of a random variable or a random</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:04,039 –&gt; 00:02:07,319<br>choice of a birthday.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:07,319 –&gt; 00:02:14,599<br>So each of these people are really random variables that return the value of a birthday.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:14,599 –&gt; 00:02:18,280<br>And as a matter of fact, we’re going to assume that all the birthdays are equally likely.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:18,280 –&gt; 00:02:19,560<br>Real birthdays aren’t there.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:19,560 –&gt; 00:02:22,919<br>They tend to be, January tends to be a popular month.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:22,919 –&gt; 00:02:27,240<br>November tends to be a more popular month than other times.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:27,240 –&gt; 00:02:33,400<br>But let’s ignore that because if the applications in crypto, things really are uniform and it</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:33,400 –&gt; 00:02:39,400<br>makes our analysis still plausible, but easy if we assume that birthdays are equally likely.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:39,400 –&gt; 00:02:40,400<br>Okay.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:40,400 –&gt; 00:02:46,800<br>Pay is the number of pairs of birthdays that match in this population of N people.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:46,800 –&gt; 00:02:47,800<br>Okay.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:47,800 –&gt; 00:02:52,000<br>Let’s get a grip on P by thinking of it as a sum of indicator variables.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:52,000 –&gt; 00:02:57,200<br>So let’s let MIGA be the indicator variable that the I think J’s people among the N have</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:57,200 –&gt; 00:02:59,599<br>a matching birthday.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:59,599 –&gt; 00:03:06,799<br>Well, the number of matching birthdays is then simply the sum over all the possible pairs</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:06,799 –&gt; 00:03:10,799<br>of people of whether or not they have a matching birthday.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:10,799 –&gt; 00:03:14,199<br>It’s the sum of these indicator variables, MIGA.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:14,199 –&gt; 00:03:18,599<br>And the number of these indicator variables is of course all the ways of choosing to out</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:18,599 –&gt; 00:03:20,719<br>of N people.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:20,719 –&gt; 00:03:27,359<br>So in short, if I look at the expectation of MIGA, let’s think about that for a minute.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:27,360 –&gt; 00:03:30,360<br>We’re assuming that all the birthdays are equally likely.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:30,360 –&gt; 00:03:33,520<br>And so I’m asking whether the I think the J’s people have the same birthday.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:33,520 –&gt; 00:03:38,360<br>Well, whatever the I think person’s birthday turns out to be, let’s say it’s November</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:38,360 –&gt; 00:03:46,000<br>5th, the J’s person who has a uniform probability of equaling any birthday still has a uniform</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:46,000 –&gt; 00:03:47,000<br>probability.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:47,000 –&gt; 00:03:52,240<br>One chance indeed of equaling November 5th, which happens to be my birthday.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:52,240 –&gt; 00:03:53,240<br>Okay.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:53,240 –&gt; 00:03:59,400<br>And short, the probability that any two people have a matching birthday is one chance</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:59,400 –&gt; 00:04:00,719<br>indeed.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:00,719 –&gt; 00:04:06,520<br>And that means that the expectation of the indicator variable for that event, MIGA, is 1 over</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:06,520 –&gt; 00:04:12,800<br>D. And that tells us by linearity of expectation that the expected number of pairs is simply</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:12,800 –&gt; 00:04:19,139<br>the number of those pairs times the expected number per pair and choose 2 times 1 over</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:19,139 –&gt; 00:04:20,139<br>D.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:20,539 –&gt; 00:04:23,259<br>Well, as I said, we have data for 110 students.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:23,259 –&gt; 00:04:31,259<br>So the expected number of pairs in a collection of a student body of 110 is 110 choose 2 times</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:31,259 –&gt; 00:04:40,779<br>1 over 365 or about 16.4 pairs is the expected number of pairs of matching birthdays.</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:40,779 –&gt; 00:04:42,279<br>Okay.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:42,279 –&gt; 00:04:44,180<br>Now that’s an expected value.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:44,180 –&gt; 00:04:49,379<br>How likely is it to be if I take a selection of 110 students and I count how many pairs</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:49,379 –&gt; 00:04:50,879<br>of birthdays are there?</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:50,879 –&gt; 00:04:54,500<br>Do I really expect to get close to 16.4 or not?</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:54,500 –&gt; 00:05:01,579<br>Well, what we’re asking for is the probability that P is near its mean, that the distance between</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:01,579 –&gt; 00:05:09,620<br>P and 16.4 is greater than K. I hope that as K gets bigger, this probability is small.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:09,620 –&gt; 00:05:17,459<br>And so I’m really quite likely to have close to 16.4 birthdays in the sample of 110.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:17,459 –&gt; 00:05:21,339<br>But this probability is one that’s a mess to calculate.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:21,339 –&gt; 00:05:27,859<br>But we can get a grip on it because the variance of P is easy to calculate and that will allow</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:27,859 –&gt; 00:05:33,379<br>us to apply the Chubby-Chief bound and get some kind of an estimate on the likelihood</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:33,379 –&gt; 00:05:37,779<br>that P is near its expectation.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:37,779 –&gt; 00:05:46,019<br>So the key observation that we need is that the indicator variables are pairwise independent.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:46,019 –&gt; 00:05:50,799<br>So let’s think about the indicator variable for the event that the Ithin and the Jth people</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:50,799 –&gt; 00:05:51,799<br>have the same birthday.</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:51,799 –&gt; 00:05:53,740<br>Let’s call them Albert and Drew.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:53,740 –&gt; 00:05:56,779<br>So Albert’s the Ith person, Drew is the Jth person.</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:56,779 –&gt; 00:06:01,259<br>And I’m interested in the event that Albert and Drew have the same birthday.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:01,259 –&gt; 00:06:05,819<br>And let’s compare that to another pair of people and whether or not they have the same</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:05,819 –&gt; 00:06:06,819<br>birthday.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:06,819 –&gt; 00:06:08,620<br>So let’s first of all think about David Mike.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:08,620 –&gt; 00:06:10,740<br>Whether David Mike have the same birthday.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:10,740 –&gt; 00:06:14,459<br>And I want to know are these two events independent?</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:14,459 –&gt; 00:06:19,219<br>Well remember we are assuming that Albert’s birthday is independent of Drew’s birthday</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:19,219 –&gt; 00:06:21,779<br>is independent of David’s independence of Mike.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:21,779 –&gt; 00:06:27,019<br>Each of the people is supposedly chosen independently and their birthdays are independently</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:27,019 –&gt; 00:06:28,419<br>are independent.</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:28,419 –&gt; 00:06:33,500<br>So it’s obvious that these two pairs that don’t overlap have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:33,500 –&gt; 00:06:34,740<br>And we don’t have to worry about them.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:34,740 –&gt; 00:06:40,019<br>You could prove that formally but it is obvious because each of the individual birthdays</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:40,019 –&gt; 00:06:42,459<br>are independent.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:42,459 –&gt; 00:06:48,579<br>Now what’s more interesting is the case when I ask whether or not Albert and Drew having</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:48,579 –&gt; 00:06:53,579<br>the same birthday is independent of Albert and Mike having the same birthday.</p>
<p>95<br>00:06:53,579 –&gt; 00:06:55,419<br>And that one is not so obvious.</p>
<p>96<br>00:06:55,419 –&gt; 00:07:00,179<br>Here’s a way to think about what could go wrong.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:00,179 –&gt; 00:07:03,500<br>Suppose that in fact the birthdays weren’t uniform.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:03,500 –&gt; 00:07:06,019<br>Suppose that some birthday was more common than others.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:06,019 –&gt; 00:07:07,019<br>Okay.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:07,019 –&gt; 00:07:11,179<br>That makes it more likely that if Albert and Drew have the same birthday.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:11,180 –&gt; 00:07:17,220<br>It slants things so that they are more likely to have this very common birthday than they</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:17,220 –&gt; 00:07:20,459<br>would have been otherwise.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:20,459 –&gt; 00:07:26,500<br>And now once I know that they match and therefore are more likely to have the common birthday</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:26,500 –&gt; 00:07:28,899<br>than they would have without any information.</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:28,899 –&gt; 00:07:34,379<br>I know that Albert is more likely to have this common birthday than otherwise.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:34,379 –&gt; 00:07:40,379<br>And that means that Mike is even more likely to match Albert because Albert’s got the common</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:40,379 –&gt; 00:07:47,899<br>birthday than Mike was to match Albert without any further information about what Albert’s</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:47,899 –&gt; 00:07:48,899<br>likely birthday was.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:48,899 –&gt; 00:07:52,459<br>You can think about that and it can be worked out numerically easily enough.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:52,459 –&gt; 00:07:57,540<br>So uniformity is going to be a crucial factor here in order to conclude that Albert and</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:57,540 –&gt; 00:08:05,259<br>Drew and Albert and Mike are mutually independent events.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:05,259 –&gt; 00:08:06,579<br>But let’s go back and think about it.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:06,579 –&gt; 00:08:10,579<br>What we really need is that Mike is uniform in order to conclude that these two events</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:10,579 –&gt; 00:08:15,620<br>are independent because we know that Mike and Drew and Albert separately are independent</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:15,620 –&gt; 00:08:16,620<br>of each other.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:16,620 –&gt; 00:08:18,379<br>Their birthdays are chosen independently.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:18,379 –&gt; 00:08:23,939<br>So that intuitively means that the probability that Mike has any given birthday doesn’t really</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:23,939 –&gt; 00:08:27,579<br>matter what’s going on with Albert and Drew because Mike is independent of Albert and</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:27,579 –&gt; 00:08:28,579<br>Drew.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:28,579 –&gt; 00:08:35,939<br>And if we know that Mike’s probability of having a birthday is uniform then whatever the</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:35,940 –&gt; 00:08:41,540<br>birthday that Albert has, whether he matches Drew or not, Mike has a one chance in the</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:41,540 –&gt; 00:08:46,940<br>of hitting the same birthday as whatever Albert wound up having.</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:46,940 –&gt; 00:08:52,100<br>And that means that the probability that Mike matches Albert is the same one overdue</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:52,100 –&gt; 00:08:56,420<br>than it would have been if we had no further information.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:56,420 –&gt; 00:09:01,460<br>This is an argument that in fact is made rigorous in some class problems and a problem set</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:01,540 –&gt; 00:09:08,139<br>but let’s just take it as plausible enough based on this hand waving argument that I</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:08,139 –&gt; 00:09:13,700<br>articulated that these two events are independent pairwise.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:13,700 –&gt; 00:09:22,379<br>And so the corresponding indicator variables, M, Albert, Drew and M, Albert, Mike are independent</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:22,379 –&gt; 00:09:23,860<br>of each other.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:23,860 –&gt; 00:09:24,860<br>Yep.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:24,860 –&gt; 00:09:26,100<br>So that’s what we’ve argued.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:26,100 –&gt; 00:09:30,500<br>But notice that these events of pairwise matching are certainly not three-way independent</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:30,500 –&gt; 00:09:34,379<br>because after all, if I know that Albert and Drew have the same birthday and that Albert</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:34,379 –&gt; 00:09:38,340<br>and Mike have the same birthday, I absolutely know with certainty that Drew and Mike have</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:38,340 –&gt; 00:09:39,500<br>the same birthday.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:39,500 –&gt; 00:09:45,779<br>So this is a very nice basic example where you have pairwise independence but not three-way</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:45,779 –&gt; 00:09:53,659<br>independence assuming that all of these random variables Albert, Drew and Mike are uniform</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:53,659 –&gt; 00:09:56,460<br>in what birthday they have.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:56,460 –&gt; 00:09:57,460<br>Okay.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:57,460 –&gt; 00:09:59,700<br>So let’s go back to counting birthdays.</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:59,700 –&gt; 00:10:03,020<br>The variance of an indicator is PQ.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:03,020 –&gt; 00:10:09,460<br>So in this case, P is 1 over 365 and Q is 1 minus 1 over 365.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:09,460 –&gt; 00:10:17,540<br>And because of pairwise independence, the variance of P, which is the sum of the MIJ, is the variance</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:17,540 –&gt; 00:10:23,340<br>of the number of birthday pairs, is the sum of those variances.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:23,340 –&gt; 00:10:32,019<br>It’s 110 choose 2 times the variance of the MIJ turns out to be about 16.37, which means</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:32,019 –&gt; 00:10:36,820<br>that the standard deviation sigma is less than 4.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:36,820 –&gt; 00:10:47,660<br>Now I can apply Chev HF because by the Chev HF band, the probability that 16.4 is within</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:47,660 –&gt; 00:10:52,500<br>is further away than 2 sigma is only one chance in 4, which means the probability that it’s</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:52,500 –&gt; 00:10:59,000<br>within 2 sigma that the actual number of measured pairs is within 2 sigma of the expected</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:59,000 –&gt; 00:11:06,179<br>number 16.4 is greater than 1 minus a quarter or 3 quarters.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:06,179 –&gt; 00:11:13,980<br>There’s a 3 quarters chance that the number of pairs that we find is within 2 sigma of</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:13,980 –&gt; 00:11:16,460<br>the expected number 16.4.</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:16,460 –&gt; 00:11:24,420<br>Sigma was about 4, so this is 8, which means that we’re expecting with 3 quarters probability,</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:24,420 –&gt; 00:11:31,220<br>somewhere between 8.4 meaning 9 and 24.4 meaning 25 pairs.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:31,220 –&gt; 00:11:34,740<br>So 75% of the time in a class of 110.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:34,740 –&gt; 00:11:40,620<br>We’re going to find between 9 and 25 pairs of birthdays.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:40,620 –&gt; 00:11:41,620<br>Did that actually happen?</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:41,620 –&gt; 00:11:43,100<br>Well, it did.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:43,100 –&gt; 00:11:49,220<br>In our class of 110 for whom we had data, we actually found 21 pairs of matching birthdays.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:49,220 –&gt; 00:11:55,980<br>Literally, we found 12 pairs and 3 triples, but each triple counts as 3 matching pairs.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:55,980 –&gt; 00:11:59,540<br>And there they are, the blues or triples.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:59,540 –&gt; 00:12:03,500<br>And you can see whether your birthday is among those and knowing that you have a classmate</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:03,500 –&gt; 00:12:07,019<br>or two that have the same birthday that you do.</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:07,019 –&gt; 00:12:12,460<br>So there are 15 different birthdays, but they count as 21 pairs because it’s 12 single</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:12,460 –&gt; 00:12:16,420<br>pairs and 3 triplets each of which counts for 3 pairs.</p>
