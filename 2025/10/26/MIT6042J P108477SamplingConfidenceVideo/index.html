                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,600<br>Now let’s work out an example that shows how to use the pairwise independent sampling theorem</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,600 –&gt; 00:00:10,240<br>to actually do some sampling and estimation.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,240 –&gt; 00:00:20,160<br>So let’s remember that our basic theorem says that if we have n independent random variables,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:20,160 –&gt; 00:00:23,760<br>pairwise independent with the same mean and variance.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,760 –&gt; 00:00:28,560<br>And we look at their average, the probability that their average differs from the mean by</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,559 –&gt; 00:00:35,839<br>more than a given tolerance delta is less than or equal to this formula here, which is</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:35,839 –&gt; 00:00:40,039<br>the standard deviation over delta squared times 1 over n.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:40,039 –&gt; 00:00:43,840<br>Now we’re just going to be plugging into this formula, but I want to state it here for</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:43,840 –&gt; 00:00:47,119<br>the record to remember that this is the pairwise independent sampling theorem that we’re</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:47,119 –&gt; 00:00:54,159<br>given, which is what we’ve seen in general allows us to calculate the degree of confidence</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:54,159 –&gt; 00:01:00,879<br>we can have, the probability that we have given n or the n that we need given how confident</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:00,879 –&gt; 00:01:02,679<br>we want to be.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,679 –&gt; 00:01:04,840<br>So let’s go ahead and do the example.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:04,840 –&gt; 00:01:08,959<br>And what I want to think about is the possibility of swimming in the Charles.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,959 –&gt; 00:01:15,719<br>The Charles has a caliform count califormer, some rather undesirable bacteria that are associated</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,719 –&gt; 00:01:18,640<br>with fecal matter.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,640 –&gt; 00:01:22,359<br>And we want to know whether it’s safe to swim in the Charles.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:22,359 –&gt; 00:01:27,920<br>It’s a petri dish showing a kind of sample of bacteria that you might grow, culture to see</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:27,920 –&gt; 00:01:29,159<br>what’s going on.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:29,159 –&gt; 00:01:34,480<br>The environmental protection agency requires that the average CMD, the caliform microbial</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:34,480 –&gt; 00:01:40,319<br>density on the dish, is less than 200.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:40,319 –&gt; 00:01:47,439<br>And what we want to do is figure out whether when we do a sample of CMDs around the river</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:47,439 –&gt; 00:01:53,920<br>and we get some numbers out, whether in fact we will conclude that the caliform, that the</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:53,920 –&gt; 00:01:55,879<br>average CMD is less than 200.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:55,879 –&gt; 00:01:57,920<br>We need to convince the EPA of that.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:57,920 –&gt; 00:02:00,200<br>Now we’re never going to be certain.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:00,200 –&gt; 00:02:05,959<br>But what we’re going to do is take 32 measurements at random times the locations around the river.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:05,959 –&gt; 00:02:10,000<br>And we’re going to collect these 32 measurements of CMD.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:10,000 –&gt; 00:02:17,319<br>And it’s going to turn out that although a few of them are over 200, the average is</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:17,319 –&gt; 00:02:18,319<br>well under 200.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:18,319 –&gt; 00:02:23,079<br>The average of the 32 samples that we’ve taken is 180.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:23,079 –&gt; 00:02:30,479<br>And our task now is to convince the environmental protection agency that on the basis of our data,</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:30,479 –&gt; 00:02:34,159<br>that the average in the whole river is really less than 200.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:34,159 –&gt; 00:02:38,599<br>Even though there were a couple of places it was over 100, but on average it was 180.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:38,599 –&gt; 00:02:44,879<br>Can we convince the EPA that the actual average is less than 200?</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:44,879 –&gt; 00:02:49,780<br>And so we’re trying to convince them that our estimate based on the sample is within</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:49,780 –&gt; 00:02:52,599<br>20 of the actual average.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:52,599 –&gt; 00:02:54,120<br>We got 180.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:54,120 –&gt; 00:03:01,759<br>So if our estimate is when 20 of the truth, then in fact the average is less than 200.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:01,759 –&gt; 00:03:03,759<br>Well, how are we going to do that?</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:03,759 –&gt; 00:03:08,560<br>Well, let’s look at the parameters in the pairwise independent sampling theorem and see</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:08,560 –&gt; 00:03:09,560<br>what we have.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:09,560 –&gt; 00:03:12,960<br>So C is the actual average CMD in the river.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:12,960 –&gt; 00:03:14,359<br>That’s what we don’t know.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:14,360 –&gt; 00:03:17,360<br>We’re trying to estimate it.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:17,360 –&gt; 00:03:21,440<br>So our samples correspond to a random variable.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:21,440 –&gt; 00:03:25,880<br>We’re taking a measurement of the CMD at a random time and place.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:25,880 –&gt; 00:03:31,560<br>And that defines a random variable whose expectation is the unknown city.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:31,560 –&gt; 00:03:36,600<br>So we’ve defined by our sampling process a random variable with mean mu.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:36,600 –&gt; 00:03:39,400<br>In fact, we’ve done it with 32 variables.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:39,400 –&gt; 00:03:46,960<br>So n samples mean n mutually independent random variables all with mean equal to the number</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:46,960 –&gt; 00:03:49,159<br>that I’m trying to estimate.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:49,159 –&gt; 00:03:53,080<br>And an is the average of the n CMD samples.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:53,080 –&gt; 00:03:57,719<br>So we have an a32 that we’re trying to understand.</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:57,719 –&gt; 00:04:00,159<br>So here’s the independent sampling theorem formula.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:00,159 –&gt; 00:04:01,560<br>And let’s see what I know already.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:01,560 –&gt; 00:04:03,599<br>I’m going to plug in the knowns.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:03,599 –&gt; 00:04:05,879<br>What I know is that n is 32.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:05,879 –&gt; 00:04:09,479<br>mu is the unknown C that we’re trying to estimate.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:09,479 –&gt; 00:04:16,800<br>And the delta that it matters to us is 20 because we want to argue that if our average of 180,</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:16,800 –&gt; 00:04:23,000<br>our measurement of 180 was within 20 of the truth, then in fact, we’re under the 200 that</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:23,000 –&gt; 00:04:25,360<br>the EPA specifies.</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:25,360 –&gt; 00:04:34,040<br>So let’s plug in our known parameters, 32 for n and 20 for the tolerance.</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:34,040 –&gt; 00:04:35,879<br>And they plug in here.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:35,879 –&gt; 00:04:41,920<br>And that leaves me with the standard deviation, which the formula requires.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:41,920 –&gt; 00:04:42,920<br>And I have to plug in.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:42,920 –&gt; 00:04:48,480<br>And that is a problem because we don’t know what the standard deviation is.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:48,480 –&gt; 00:04:53,560<br>Now sometimes you can kind of argue that you can figure out what the standard deviation</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:53,560 –&gt; 00:04:58,240<br>is because you have a theory of what the random distribution is of these measurements.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:58,240 –&gt; 00:05:03,960<br>And therefore, you can calculate what its standard deviation should be.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:03,959 –&gt; 00:05:08,839<br>Other times you can actually take a sample of the deviation of your sample.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:08,839 –&gt; 00:05:13,560<br>And use that as an estimate of the sample of the actual standard deviation.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:13,560 –&gt; 00:05:16,680<br>But that’s kind of circular and we’re not going to go there.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:16,680 –&gt; 00:05:23,159<br>But another way to do it is to say that if you had some bounds on the maximum possible</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:23,159 –&gt; 00:05:28,199<br>discrepancy of your measurements, if you had done these kinds of sampling testings of</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:28,199 –&gt; 00:05:35,159<br>CMDs for a long time, and you had never observed two that were more than 50 apart, then what</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:35,159 –&gt; 00:05:43,120<br>you could argue is that the range of measurements is going to be only 50.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:43,120 –&gt; 00:05:48,240<br>So what we can do is if we say that L is the maximum possible difference that will ever</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:48,240 –&gt; 00:05:55,919<br>measure among samples, then in fact, what you can say is that the worst possible standard</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:55,920 –&gt; 00:06:02,560<br>deviation when your random variable is ranging over an interval L is L over 2.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:02,560 –&gt; 00:06:05,360<br>And you can check that algebraically.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:05,360 –&gt; 00:06:07,240<br>But for now, let’s just take that as a fact.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:07,240 –&gt; 00:06:12,360<br>If you know that when your measurements are going to differ by at most L between max and</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:12,360 –&gt; 00:06:16,439<br>min, the standard deviation can’t be more than L over 2.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:16,439 –&gt; 00:06:21,920<br>And if we know that L is 50, then I got a number finally to plug in because now I can plug</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:21,920 –&gt; 00:06:23,759<br>in 25 for sigma.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:23,759 –&gt; 00:06:25,159<br>So let’s do that.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:25,159 –&gt; 00:06:32,519<br>And when I do that, I come out with this calculation that says that the probability that my average minus</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:32,519 –&gt; 00:06:41,360<br>C was greater than 20, that my 1A32, which we said was 180, was more than 20 away from</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:41,360 –&gt; 00:06:46,079<br>the truth is less than .05.</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:46,079 –&gt; 00:06:53,000<br>Or flipping it around, the probability that my average is within 20 of the truth is greater</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:53,000 –&gt; 00:06:55,959<br>than .095.</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:55,959 –&gt; 00:07:03,199<br>And so we would like to be able to say now that the probability that the unknown C is the</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:03,199 –&gt; 00:07:08,040<br>180 that we measured for A32 plus or minus 20 is at least 95%.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:08,040 –&gt; 00:07:10,319<br>That seems to be what the theorem told us.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:10,319 –&gt; 00:07:15,560<br>Let’s go back to the theorem says that the probability that A32, which we measured to be 180 minus</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:15,560 –&gt; 00:07:20,000<br>C is less than or equal to 20, is greater than 0.95.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:20,000 –&gt; 00:07:27,759<br>So we should go back and tell the EPA that the probability is that C is less than 200</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:27,759 –&gt; 00:07:30,000<br>with probability 0.95.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:30,000 –&gt; 00:07:32,360<br>And we’d be pretty tempted to say that.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:32,360 –&gt; 00:07:33,680<br>But it’s not right.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:33,680 –&gt; 00:07:36,360<br>It’s technically the wrong thing to say.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:36,360 –&gt; 00:07:37,560<br>And why is that?</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:37,560 –&gt; 00:07:44,680<br>Well, it’s an important idea, which is that we’re talking about something other than probability</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:44,680 –&gt; 00:07:45,680<br>here.</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:45,680 –&gt; 00:07:48,079<br>We’re talking about confidence, not probability.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:48,079 –&gt; 00:07:50,079<br>And let’s explain that a little bit more.</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:50,079 –&gt; 00:07:51,599<br>Here’s the issue.</p>
<p>109<br>00:07:51,599 –&gt; 00:07:54,719<br>The number C is a number in the real world.</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:54,719 –&gt; 00:08:00,399<br>It’s an actual physical quantity, which is the average CMD in the river.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:00,399 –&gt; 00:08:04,279<br>We don’t know what it is, but that does not make it a random variable.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:04,279 –&gt; 00:08:09,519<br>It is or it isn’t within less than 200 or more than 200 and so on.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:09,519 –&gt; 00:08:17,519<br>What’s going on is that we have created a probabilistic model of sampling that is</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:17,519 –&gt; 00:08:23,279<br>designed to have in our probabilistic model this unknown constant.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:23,279 –&gt; 00:08:26,719<br>There’s nothing probabilistic about the constant.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:26,719 –&gt; 00:08:33,519<br>We’ve introduced the probability by thinking of our random sampling as random variables.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:33,519 –&gt; 00:08:34,840<br>We control the randomness.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:34,840 –&gt; 00:08:36,720<br>We can’t say that C is random.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:36,720 –&gt; 00:08:38,079<br>Our measurements are random.</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:38,079 –&gt; 00:08:44,799<br>So the right thing we can say is that the possible outcomes of our sampling process can</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:44,799 –&gt; 00:08:48,159<br>be persuasively modeled as a random variable.</p>
<p>122<br>00:08:48,159 –&gt; 00:08:53,199<br>So what we can say is that the probability that our sampling process will yield an average</p>
<p>123<br>00:08:53,199 –&gt; 00:08:58,519<br>that’s within 20 of the true average is at least 0.95.</p>
<p>124<br>00:08:58,519 –&gt; 00:08:59,919<br>So that’s a funny thing to say.</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:59,919 –&gt; 00:09:06,120<br>What you do is you go and tell the EPA, it says, look, we don’t know what the real average</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:06,120 –&gt; 00:09:07,120<br>is.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:07,120 –&gt; 00:09:13,319<br>But we have a process that gets the right answer 95% of the time to within plus or minus</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:13,320 –&gt; 00:09:20,840<br>20 and we measured it and our process that we is right 95% of the time came in with an</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:20,840 –&gt; 00:09:24,520<br>answer that said it’s less than 200.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:24,520 –&gt; 00:09:25,520<br>OK.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:25,520 –&gt; 00:09:27,840<br>Now that’s the right thing to say.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:27,840 –&gt; 00:09:29,040<br>That’s the truth.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:29,040 –&gt; 00:09:34,640<br>We’re making a probabilistic statement about our, the general properties of our sampling</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:34,640 –&gt; 00:09:38,720<br>process and saying, OK, our sampling process is usually right.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:38,720 –&gt; 00:09:41,920<br>The sampling process said less than 200.</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:41,920 –&gt; 00:09:43,759<br>So we think that that’s probably right.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:43,759 –&gt; 00:09:47,480<br>But we can’t say it is right and we can’t even say it’s right with any probability.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:47,480 –&gt; 00:09:53,600<br>It’s just the way that our mostly reliable process yielded an answer.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:53,600 –&gt; 00:09:56,960<br>And that’s an important idea to distinguish.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:56,960 –&gt; 00:10:05,240<br>So it’s our estimate that’s correct with probability 0.95.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:05,240 –&gt; 00:10:10,919<br>Now this is a long thing to say to the EPA and what we’d like to go back is language</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:10,919 –&gt; 00:10:20,159<br>that says that we think that the real average C is within 20 of 180 is probably within 20</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:20,159 –&gt; 00:10:23,200<br>of 180 because that’s what our tests seem to say.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:23,200 –&gt; 00:10:26,840<br>But we’re not allowed to talk about the probability that C has some value or other.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:26,840 –&gt; 00:10:32,240<br>So instead we summarize the story about how we measured C using a probabilistic process</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:32,240 –&gt; 00:10:41,240<br>that’s right 95% of the time by saying that C is 180 plus or minus 20 at the 95% confidence</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:41,240 –&gt; 00:10:42,960<br>level.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:42,960 –&gt; 00:10:47,879<br>And that is the, that’s a shorthand way of saying we’ve got this process that we believe</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:47,879 –&gt; 00:10:54,360<br>in that measured this unknown quantity and told us what it was.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:54,360 –&gt; 00:10:59,200<br>So the moral here that we’ll wrap up this little video with is that when you’re told</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:59,200 –&gt; 00:11:04,320<br>that some fact holds at a high confidence level because of some tester or some random</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:04,320 –&gt; 00:11:10,759<br>experiment or some polar poster, you have to remember that is that what that implies is</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:10,759 –&gt; 00:11:19,040<br>that somebody designed a random experiment to try to get an estimate of reality.</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:19,040 –&gt; 00:11:23,360<br>And you can always question whether you believe in that random experiment.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:23,360 –&gt; 00:11:27,000<br>It’s important to understand that there is some random experiment back there and you</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:27,000 –&gt; 00:11:31,720<br>should be wondering about what is it and do I believe in it.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:31,720 –&gt; 00:11:37,159<br>And even more important question to ask is why are you hearing about this particular</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:37,159 –&gt; 00:11:38,639<br>experiment?</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:38,639 –&gt; 00:11:41,960<br>How many other experiments were tried and not reported?</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:41,960 –&gt; 00:11:49,360<br>The point is that people can perform various kinds of tests and at the 95% or higher confidence</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:49,360 –&gt; 00:11:50,360<br>level.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:50,360 –&gt; 00:11:54,720<br>But when the tests don’t come up with an interesting result, they don’t bother to publish</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:54,879 –&gt; 00:11:56,279<br>them or announce them.</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:56,279 –&gt; 00:12:00,759<br>And of course when they come up with a surprising result which is going to be wrong one at a</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:00,759 –&gt; 00:12:06,560<br>20 times, those are the results that they publish and submit and advertise because they sound</p>
<p>166<br>00:12:06,560 –&gt; 00:12:07,560<br>good.</p>
<p>167<br>00:12:07,560 –&gt; 00:12:15,040<br>In fact, the major drug company, Blackshoe Smith Klein, after paying $3 billion as a judgment</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:15,040 –&gt; 00:12:20,320<br>against them in 2012 for suppressing the results, negative results of clinical trials, just</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:20,320 –&gt; 00:12:26,000<br>agreed to now make public in February 2013, all of the clinical trials that they perform</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:26,000 –&gt; 00:12:30,440<br>so that you’re not just learning about the cherry-peck positive results but about the negative</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:30,440 –&gt; 00:12:32,200<br>ones as well.</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:32,200 –&gt; 00:12:43,560<br>And in fact, get this point home.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:43,560 –&gt; 00:12:49,960<br>You might want to look at the cartoon at XKCD, which explains how it is that there’s a problem</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:49,960 –&gt; 00:12:54,160<br>with green jelly beans at the 95% confidence level.</p>
