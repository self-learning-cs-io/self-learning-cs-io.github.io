                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:08,759<br>You’ve seen a lot of functions in introductory calculus,</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:08,759 –&gt; 00:00:13,160<br>trig functions, rational functions, exponentials, logs, and so on.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,160 –&gt; 00:00:18,240<br>I don’t know whether your calculus course has included a general discussion of functions.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,240 –&gt; 00:00:21,039<br>The old fashioned ones didn’t.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,039 –&gt; 00:00:26,839<br>And we will go into that now in this segment and we’re going to be interpreting functions</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:26,839 –&gt; 00:00:29,240<br>as a special case of binary relations.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:29,239 –&gt; 00:00:31,639<br>So let’s just say what a binary relation is.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:31,639 –&gt; 00:00:37,320<br>A binary relation is a mathematical object that associates elements of one set called the domain</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:37,320 –&gt; 00:00:39,920<br>with elements of another set called the co-domain.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:39,920 –&gt; 00:00:46,000<br>And I’m going to give you a bunch of examples of binary relations in a short moment,</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:46,000 –&gt; 00:00:50,840<br>but let’s just talk about what their foreign, what their role is.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:50,840 –&gt; 00:00:56,840<br>So they may be familiar to you as computer scientists if you’ve worked with any relational</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:56,840 –&gt; 00:01:01,880<br>databases like SQL or my SQL, my SQL.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:01,880 –&gt; 00:01:07,800<br>And we’ll see an example that indicates where the original ideas behind those relational</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:07,800 –&gt; 00:01:10,200<br>databases came from.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:10,200 –&gt; 00:01:16,640<br>But even more fundamental relations are one of the most basic mathematical abstractions</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:16,640 –&gt; 00:01:18,840<br>right after sets.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:18,840 –&gt; 00:01:22,600<br>And they play role everywhere.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:22,600 –&gt; 00:01:26,600<br>We’re going to be looking in later lectures at special kinds of binary relations like</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:26,599 –&gt; 00:01:34,719<br>equivalence relations and partial orders and numerical congruences.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:34,719 –&gt; 00:01:41,159<br>But today we’re going to set up the machinery to be using binary relations for counting,</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:41,159 –&gt; 00:01:46,359<br>which will be another important application in this class.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:46,359 –&gt; 00:01:49,919<br>So let’s look at an example.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:49,919 –&gt; 00:01:55,599<br>And I’m going to take one of the close to home, the registered for relation, which is</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:55,599 –&gt; 00:01:57,759<br>a relation between students.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:57,759 –&gt; 00:01:59,679<br>That’s going to be the domain.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:59,679 –&gt; 00:02:04,759<br>In this case, four students, Jason, Joan, Ewe and Adam.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:04,759 –&gt; 00:02:14,919<br>And subjects for subjects as a coincidence, 6042, 003, 012, and 004.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:14,919 –&gt; 00:02:22,120<br>And the relation R is going to be indicated by arrows, which show just which students are</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:22,120 –&gt; 00:02:26,680<br>associated with which subjects, meaning that they’re registered for that subject.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:26,680 –&gt; 00:02:34,000<br>So if we look at Jason, we can see that there’s a particular arrow connecting Jason and</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:34,000 –&gt; 00:02:36,039<br>6042.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:36,039 –&gt; 00:02:40,680<br>And what that tells us is that Jason is registered for 6042.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:40,680 –&gt; 00:02:46,120<br>Now there’s a bunch of notations that are used with respect to binary relations.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:46,120 –&gt; 00:02:49,759<br>So let’s look at some.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:49,759 –&gt; 00:02:54,000<br>One way to write it is if you think of the relation R as like an equality sign or a less</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:54,000 –&gt; 00:02:59,039<br>than sign where it’s normally written in the middle of the two things that it’s connecting</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:59,039 –&gt; 00:03:07,159<br>as in this example, Jason R6042, that would be called in fixed notation.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:07,159 –&gt; 00:03:12,439<br>Sometimes it’s written as a binary predicate, R of Jason, 6042.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:12,439 –&gt; 00:03:18,560<br>That would be kind of prefix notation where the relation or operator comes first.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:18,560 –&gt; 00:03:24,719<br>And then if you start being a little closer to the formal definition of what a binary relation</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:24,719 –&gt; 00:03:30,719<br>is, you could say that the ordered pair, Jason, 6042, is a member of the relation.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:30,719 –&gt; 00:03:35,560<br>If you want to be really precise, you would say that it was a member of the graph of the</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:35,560 –&gt; 00:03:36,560<br>relation.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:36,560 –&gt; 00:03:44,280<br>And I’ll come back and elaborate further on what the graph of a relation is and what this</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:44,280 –&gt; 00:03:47,480<br>ordered pair’s business is.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:47,479 –&gt; 00:03:50,039<br>And for now, just let’s continue with this example.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:50,039 –&gt; 00:03:56,079<br>And a basic concept with relations is the idea of the image of a bunch of domain elements</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:56,079 –&gt; 00:03:57,839<br>under the relation.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:57,839 –&gt; 00:04:03,719<br>So you can think of the relation as an operator that applies to domain elements or even sets</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:03,719 –&gt; 00:04:05,239<br>of domain elements.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:05,239 –&gt; 00:04:12,519<br>So if I write R of Jason, that defines the subjects that Jason is registered for.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:12,520 –&gt; 00:04:19,040<br>So looking at the picture, R is not a function so that there may be more than one subject,</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:19,040 –&gt; 00:04:25,400<br>as is you’d expect for a student to be registered for multiple courses at MIT.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:25,400 –&gt; 00:04:32,439<br>So Jason in this diagram is registered for 6042 and 6012 as indicated by the highlighted</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:32,439 –&gt; 00:04:40,280<br>to a connection arrows, which we’ve made red, which means that R of Jason is that set</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:40,279 –&gt; 00:04:46,559<br>of two courses that he’s associated with or that are associated with him, that he’s registered</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:46,559 –&gt; 00:04:50,199<br>for 6042 and 6012.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:50,199 –&gt; 00:04:56,079<br>So at this point, we’ve applied R to one domain element, one student Jason.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:56,079 –&gt; 00:05:00,479<br>But the interesting case is when you apply R to a bunch of students.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:00,479 –&gt; 00:05:06,559<br>So the general setup is that if X is a set of students, a subset of the domain, which</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:06,560 –&gt; 00:05:13,560<br>we’ve been showing in green, then if I apply R to X, it gives me all the subjects that</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:13,560 –&gt; 00:05:17,519<br>they’re taking among them, all the subjects that any one of them is taken.</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:17,519 –&gt; 00:05:19,519<br>Let’s take a look at an example.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:19,519 –&gt; 00:05:24,759<br>Well, another way to say it, I guess, is that R of X is everything in R that relates to</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:24,759 –&gt; 00:05:27,759<br>things in X.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:27,759 –&gt; 00:05:34,959<br>So if I look at Jason and E.way, and I want to know what are they connected, what are</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:34,959 –&gt; 00:05:37,079<br>they connected to under R?</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:37,079 –&gt; 00:05:40,680<br>These are the subjects that Jason or E.way is registered for.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:40,680 –&gt; 00:05:46,099<br>The way I’d find that is by looking at the arrow diagram, and I’d find that Jason is</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:46,099 –&gt; 00:05:52,399<br>taking 042 and 012 and E.way is taking 012 and 004.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:52,399 –&gt; 00:05:55,879<br>So between them, they’re taking three courses.</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:55,879 –&gt; 00:06:05,959<br>So R of Jason and E.way is in fact 042, 012 and 004.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:05,959 –&gt; 00:06:12,240<br>So another way to understand this idea of the image of a set, R of X, is that X is a set</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:12,240 –&gt; 00:06:17,719<br>of points in the set that you’re starting with called the domain.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:17,719 –&gt; 00:06:24,319<br>And R of X is going to be all of the end points in the other set, the codomane, that start</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:24,319 –&gt; 00:06:25,600<br>at X.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:25,600 –&gt; 00:06:32,680<br>If I said that as a statement in formal logic or in set theory with logical notation, I would</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:32,680 –&gt; 00:06:45,920<br>say that R of X is the set of J in subjects such that there is a D in X such that D R J.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:45,920 –&gt; 00:06:54,760<br>So what that’s exactly saying that D R J says that D is the starting point in the domain.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:54,759 –&gt; 00:06:59,800<br>D is a student. J is a subject.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:59,800 –&gt; 00:07:07,399<br>D R J means there’s an arrow that goes from student D to subject J. And we’re collecting</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:07,399 –&gt; 00:07:15,920<br>the set of those J’s that start at some D. So an arrow from X goes to J is what exists</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:15,920 –&gt; 00:07:23,480<br>in the set D in X, the R J means written in logic notation.</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:23,480 –&gt; 00:07:25,439<br>It’s really talking about the end points of arrows.</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:25,439 –&gt; 00:07:27,240<br>And it’s a nice way to think about it.</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:27,240 –&gt; 00:07:32,480<br>But you ought to be able also to retreat to give a nice crisp set theoretic definition</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:32,480 –&gt; 00:07:36,520<br>without reference to pictures if need be.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:36,520 –&gt; 00:07:41,280<br>So that’s an official definition of the image under R.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:41,279 –&gt; 00:07:49,839<br>Let’s turn now to an operation on relations, which converts one relation into another relation</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:49,839 –&gt; 00:07:55,439<br>called the inverse of R. And the inverse of R is what you get by turning the arrows around.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:55,439 –&gt; 00:08:00,799<br>So let’s look at the relation R, which is the registered for relation going from D students</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:00,799 –&gt; 00:08:03,039<br>to J subjects.</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:03,039 –&gt; 00:08:08,479<br>And then if I look at R inverse, R inverse I could think of as the registers relation,</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:08,480 –&gt; 00:08:13,720<br>X 0 4 2 registers J sin and 6 0 1 2 registers J sin and E.</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:13,720 –&gt; 00:08:19,319<br>It’s a funny usage of the word, but I needed something short that would fit on the slide.</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:19,319 –&gt; 00:08:25,759<br>So registers is basically turning the arrows backwards of is registered for.</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:25,759 –&gt; 00:08:31,800<br>And now I can apply the definition of image to R inverse in a useful way.</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:31,800 –&gt; 00:08:37,840<br>But just to be crisp about what we’re doing here is formally R inverse is gotten by flipping</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:37,840 –&gt; 00:08:39,960<br>the roll of the domain and the code domain.</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:39,960 –&gt; 00:08:47,639<br>So we have that DRJ, if and only if J, are inverse D.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:47,639 –&gt; 00:08:50,720<br>So let’s look at R inverse of 6 0 1 2.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:50,720 –&gt; 00:08:55,720<br>What that’s going to mean is all the students that are taking 6 0 1 2.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:55,720 –&gt; 00:09:01,560<br>So we start off at 6 0 1 2 and we go back to all the students that are registered for it.</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:01,560 –&gt; 00:09:02,759<br>It’s J sin and E.</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:02,759 –&gt; 00:09:08,000<br>So again, and so R inverse of 6 0 1 2 is J sin and E.</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:08,000 –&gt; 00:09:12,439<br>R inverse of 6 0 1 2 and 6 0 3, well same deal.</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:12,439 –&gt; 00:09:19,159<br>Let’s look at 6 0 3 and 6 0 1 2 and look at all the students that are registered for either one of them.</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:19,159 –&gt; 00:09:21,759<br>Now it’s J sin, J, and E.</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:21,759 –&gt; 00:09:23,600<br>Shown by those red arrows.</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:23,600 –&gt; 00:09:26,159<br>Those all the arrows coming out of those two courses,</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:26,159 –&gt; 00:09:34,959<br>so R inverse of 3 0 1 2 is that set of three students, J sin,</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:34,959 –&gt; 00:09:37,159<br>J, and E.</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:37,159 –&gt; 00:09:45,159<br>And in general, when you start off with a bunch of subjects, a bunch of elements of the code domain,</p>
<p>115<br>00:09:45,159 –&gt; 00:09:53,159<br>and you apply R inverse to it, it’s called the inverse image of Y under R.</p>
<p>116<br>00:09:53,879 –&gt; 00:09:59,559<br>Well, let’s look at the set J of all the subjects and think about what is R inverse of J?</p>
<p>117<br>00:09:59,559 –&gt; 00:10:00,480<br>What does it mean?</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:00,480 –&gt; 00:10:06,159<br>Well, R inverse of J is all the students that are registered for some subject at all,</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:06,159 –&gt; 00:10:08,439<br>which is a good thing to have.</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:08,439 –&gt; 00:10:16,600<br>So now I can start using these sets to make assertions about my database that can be useful to know.</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:16,600 –&gt; 00:10:22,759<br>So for example, if I want to say that every student is registered for some subject,</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:22,759 –&gt; 00:10:32,759<br>which of course they are, what I would say is that the set of all students is a subset of R inverse of J.</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:32,759 –&gt; 00:10:38,600<br>So this concise set theoretic containment statement,</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:38,600 –&gt; 00:10:45,559<br>the is a subset of R inverse of J is a slick way of writing the precise statement that says that</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:45,559 –&gt; 00:10:51,840<br>all the students are registered for some subject.</p>
<p>126<br>00:10:51,920 –&gt; 00:10:55,519<br>Now it happens not to be true, by the way, because if you look back at that example,</p>
<p>127<br>00:10:55,519 –&gt; 00:10:58,280<br>Adam was not registered for a subject.</p>
<p>128<br>00:10:58,280 –&gt; 00:11:07,680<br>So we’re not claiming that this is true, but simply that there’s a nice way to express it using images and containment.</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:07,680 –&gt; 00:11:12,080<br>Let’s look at a different relation that we could call the advises relation.</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:12,080 –&gt; 00:11:16,440<br>So the advises relation is going to have code domain the same set of students D,</p>
<p>131<br>00:11:16,440 –&gt; 00:11:20,360<br>but it’s going to have as a domain the set of professors.</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:20,360 –&gt; 00:11:25,160<br>And I’ve written down the initials of five prominent professors,</p>
<p>133<br>00:11:25,160 –&gt; 00:11:31,000<br>mine is at the top and you may recognize some of the others, but it doesn’t really matter if you don’t.</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:31,000 –&gt; 00:11:37,480<br>And the advises relation V is going to be indicated by those arrows.</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:37,480 –&gt; 00:11:41,880<br>So in particular, it shows that ARM is the advisor of Jason Joan,</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:41,879 –&gt; 00:11:45,000<br>E.Hue and Adam, which he happens to be.</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:45,000 –&gt; 00:11:48,720<br>FTL is an advisor of Joan and E.Hue.</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:48,720 –&gt; 00:11:52,919<br>So Joan has two advisors because she’s a double major.</p>
<p>139<br>00:11:52,919 –&gt; 00:11:55,200<br>E.Hue does as well.</p>
<p>140<br>00:11:55,200 –&gt; 00:11:56,720<br>And Adam does as well.</p>
<p>141<br>00:11:56,720 –&gt; 00:11:59,360<br>Now that I look at this example.</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:01,360 –&gt; 00:12:08,279<br>So if I look at, in particular now, the advises of FTL or TLP,</p>
<p>143<br>00:12:08,279 –&gt; 00:12:13,600<br>I’m looking at V of the set consisting of FTL and TLP.</p>
<p>144<br>00:12:13,600 –&gt; 00:12:15,959<br>And it’s going to be Joan, E.Hue and Adam.</p>
<p>145<br>00:12:15,959 –&gt; 00:12:24,439<br>So taking the image of FTL and TLP, that’s the set of advises of either of those two professors.</p>
<p>146<br>00:12:24,439 –&gt; 00:12:28,839<br>I get this set of three students, Joan, E.Hue and Adam.</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:28,839 –&gt; 00:12:30,600<br>Well, that’s a set of students.</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:30,600 –&gt; 00:12:33,720<br>And the registered relation applies to a set of students.</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:33,720 –&gt; 00:12:35,200<br>So let’s do that.</p>
<p>150<br>00:12:35,200 –&gt; 00:12:43,200<br>If I now apply R to Joan and E.Hue and Adam, what I’m getting is the subjects that they’re</p>
<p>151<br>00:12:43,200 –&gt; 00:12:45,800<br>registered for.</p>
<p>152<br>00:12:45,800 –&gt; 00:12:51,600<br>So this is called composing R and V. I’ve applied V and then I’m applying R to the result.</p>
<p>153<br>00:12:51,600 –&gt; 00:12:58,440<br>In this case, R of V of FTL and TLP is the same as R of Joan, E.Hue and Adam.</p>
<p>154<br>00:12:58,440 –&gt; 00:13:01,520<br>It’s the courses that any of them are taking.</p>
<p>155<br>00:13:01,520 –&gt; 00:13:10,200<br>Taking and it’s 003, 012 and 004.</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:10,200 –&gt; 00:13:17,520<br>So the way to understand this R of V in general is you start off with any set ex of professors</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:17,520 –&gt; 00:13:19,360<br>in the domain.</p>
<p>158<br>00:13:19,360 –&gt; 00:13:24,520<br>You take V of X, are the advises that they have.</p>
<p>159<br>00:13:24,519 –&gt; 00:13:29,720<br>And then you take R of the advises and you get the subjects that the advises are taken.</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:29,720 –&gt; 00:13:38,319<br>So R of V of X is the subjects that advises of X are taking, are registered for.</p>
<p>161<br>00:13:38,319 –&gt; 00:13:42,960<br>Well, we can abstract that out and call this the composition of R and V. It’s defined the</p>
<p>162<br>00:13:42,960 –&gt; 00:13:45,279<br>same way that functional composition is.</p>
<p>163<br>00:13:45,279 –&gt; 00:13:50,319<br>So R of V is the relation and the images of that relation.</p>
<p>164<br>00:13:50,320 –&gt; 00:13:56,160<br>The images of a set of professors under R of V is defined to be apply V to X and then</p>
<p>165<br>00:13:56,160 –&gt; 00:14:04,800<br>apply R to V of X. And it’s again called the composition of R and V.</p>
<p>166<br>00:14:04,800 –&gt; 00:14:13,480<br>What it means now is that two things are related by R of V. It relates professors and subjects.</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:13,480 –&gt; 00:14:16,520<br>And it says that a professor and a subject are related.</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:16,519 –&gt; 00:14:24,199<br>If the professor has an advisey, some advisey that T, the relationship of his teaching, intersected</p>
<p>169<br>00:14:24,199 –&gt; 00:14:30,759<br>with the relationship of has an advisey and the subject, is empty.</p>
<p>170<br>00:14:30,759 –&gt; 00:14:42,199<br>There is no pair of professor and subject that is in both T and in R of V. And this bottom</p>
<p>171<br>00:14:42,200 –&gt; 00:14:48,840<br>expression here gives you a sense of the concise way that you can express queries and assertions</p>
<p>172<br>00:14:48,840 –&gt; 00:14:56,600<br>about the database using a combination of relational operators and set operators.</p>
<p>173<br>00:14:56,600 –&gt; 00:15:01,240<br>Another way to say it, by the way, there’s a general set theoretic fact, is the way to say</p>
<p>174<br>00:15:01,240 –&gt; 00:15:08,920<br>that T and R of V intersected is empty, is to say that the set T and the set R of V, whatever</p>
<p>175<br>00:15:08,919 –&gt; 00:15:14,919<br>they are, have no points in common. An equivalent way to say that is that one set is contained</p>
<p>176<br>00:15:14,919 –&gt; 00:15:20,519<br>in the complement of the other set. So I could equally well have said this as R composed with V</p>
<p>177<br>00:15:20,519 –&gt; 00:15:29,479<br>is a subset of not T. Well, let’s step back now and summarize what we’ve done by example and</p>
<p>178<br>00:15:29,479 –&gt; 00:15:35,719<br>say a little bit about how it works in general. So as I said, a binary relation, and we’ll start</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:35,720 –&gt; 00:15:42,840<br>to be slightly more formal now. A binary relation R from a set A to a set B, associates elements of A</p>
<p>180<br>00:15:42,840 –&gt; 00:15:51,320<br>with elements of B. And there’s a picture of a general set A called the domain and a general set B</p>
<p>181<br>00:15:51,320 –&gt; 00:15:59,960<br>called the codomain. And R is given by those arrows. Well, what exactly are arrows? Well, if you’re</p>
<p>182<br>00:15:59,960 –&gt; 00:16:07,320<br>going to formalize arrows, the set of them is what’s called the graph of R. So technically, a relation</p>
<p>183<br>00:16:07,320 –&gt; 00:16:13,960<br>really has three parts. It’s not to be identified with just its arrows. A relation has a domain</p>
<p>184<br>00:16:13,960 –&gt; 00:16:22,600<br>and a codomain, and some bunch of arrows going from the domain to the codomain. The arrows can be</p>
<p>185<br>00:16:22,600 –&gt; 00:16:27,879<br>formalized by saying, all that matters about an arrow is where it begins and where it ends,</p>
<p>186<br>00:16:27,879 –&gt; 00:16:34,200<br>because it’s just designed to reflect an association between an element of the domain and an</p>
<p>187<br>00:16:34,200 –&gt; 00:16:40,039<br>element of the codomain. So technically, the arrows are just ordered pairs. And in this case,</p>
<p>188<br>00:16:40,039 –&gt; 00:16:46,759<br>there are three arrows, one from A to B2. And so you see at the bottom of the slide, an ordered pair,</p>
<p>189<br>00:16:46,759 –&gt; 00:16:54,279<br>A1B2. Another arrow goes from A1 to B4. So you see the ordered pair A1B4, and the final arrow is</p>
<p>190<br>00:16:54,279 –&gt; 00:17:01,240<br>B3B4, and you see that pair. So all the language about arrows is really talking about ordered pairs.</p>
<p>191<br>00:17:02,519 –&gt; 00:17:10,279<br>It’s just that the geometric vision image of these diagrams of their arrows makes a lot of</p>
<p>192<br>00:17:10,279 –&gt; 00:17:20,200<br>properties much clearer. So the range of R is an important concept that comes up regularly and</p>
<p>193<br>00:17:20,200 –&gt; 00:17:25,400<br>tends to be a little confusing for people. The range of R is simply the elements with arrows coming</p>
<p>194<br>00:17:25,400 –&gt; 00:17:35,720<br>in from R. It’s all of the elements that are hit by an arrow that starts in the domain. So it’s</p>
<p>195<br>00:17:35,720 –&gt; 00:17:46,519<br>really R of the domain is the range of R. Now notice that this is typically not equal to the whole</p>
<p>196<br>00:17:46,519 –&gt; 00:17:52,599<br>codomain. Let’s look at this example. Here the range of R are the hit the points that are</p>
<p>197<br>00:17:52,599 –&gt; 00:18:01,400<br>hit by elements of A under R, namely just B2 and B4. The codomain has elements B1 and B3 that are</p>
<p>198<br>00:18:01,400 –&gt; 00:18:08,440<br>missing and that are not in the range. Well, as I said, functions are a special case of relation.</p>
<p>199<br>00:18:08,440 –&gt; 00:18:16,440<br>So let’s just look at that. A function, F from a set A to a set B is a relation which associates</p>
<p>200<br>00:18:16,440 –&gt; 00:18:22,360<br>with each element in the domain. Each element, little A in the domain, capital A, with at most</p>
<p>201<br>00:18:23,000 –&gt; 00:18:32,360<br>one element of the codomain B. So this one element, if it exists, is called F of A. It’s the image</p>
<p>202<br>00:18:32,360 –&gt; 00:18:40,600<br>of the element A under the relation F. But what’s special about it is that F of A contains at most</p>
<p>203<br>00:18:40,599 –&gt; 00:18:47,879<br>one element. So let’s just look at an example again. A way to say that a relation is a function is</p>
<p>204<br>00:18:47,879 –&gt; 00:18:55,639<br>to look at all of the points on the left in the domain and make sure that none of them have more</p>
<p>205<br>00:18:55,639 –&gt; 00:19:01,159<br>than one arrow coming out. Well, in this picture, there are a couple of violations about that of that.</p>
<p>206<br>00:19:01,159 –&gt; 00:19:05,959<br>There are a couple of points on the left in A that have more than one arrow coming out. There</p>
<p>207<br>00:19:05,960 –&gt; 00:19:13,960<br>are two bad edges. But if I erase those, now I’m left with a function. And sure enough, there’s</p>
<p>208<br>00:19:13,960 –&gt; 00:19:19,160<br>at most one arrow coming out of each of the points on the left in A, some of the points have no</p>
<p>209<br>00:19:19,160 –&gt; 00:19:26,519<br>arrows coming out. That’s fine. And so for those green points with an arrow out, there’s a unique</p>
<p>210<br>00:19:27,240 –&gt; 00:19:35,480<br>F of the green point equal to a magenta point in B that’s uniquely determined by the functional</p>
<p>211<br>00:19:35,480 –&gt; 00:19:42,360<br>relation F, which may not be defined for all of the green points if they don’t have any arrow coming</p>
<p>212<br>00:19:42,360 –&gt; 00:19:51,480<br>out of them. So function means less than or equal to one arrow coming out. So if we set this formally</p>
<p>213<br>00:19:51,480 –&gt; 00:19:59,240<br>without talking about the arrows, one way is simply to say that a relation is a function if F of</p>
<p>214<br>00:19:59,240 –&gt; 00:20:06,759<br>little A is, if the size of F of little A is less than or equal to one for all of the domain elements A.</p>
<p>215<br>00:20:08,279 –&gt; 00:20:15,160<br>And a more elementary way to say it using just the language of relations and equality and</p>
<p>216<br>00:20:15,160 –&gt; 00:20:25,160<br>Boolean connectives is to say that if A is connected to two things by F, if A, F, B, and A, F, B prime,</p>
<p>217<br>00:20:25,160 –&gt; 00:20:41,080<br>then in fact B is equal to B prime. And that wraps up functions.</p>
