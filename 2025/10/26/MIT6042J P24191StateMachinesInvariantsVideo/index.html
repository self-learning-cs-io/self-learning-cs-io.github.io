                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:09,839<br>So we’re going to talk about state machines, which is a topic that you’re going to see on</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:09,839 –&gt; 00:00:16,440<br>many further courses because state machines model step-by-step processes.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:16,440 –&gt; 00:00:20,480<br>And of course, if you think about a computation, the normal way you think about it is that it’s</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:20,480 –&gt; 00:00:26,320<br>doing instructions step-by-step one after another until it finally reaches termination.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:26,320 –&gt; 00:00:35,320<br>Likewise, various digital circuits move through stages or states until they produce a final answer.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:35,320 –&gt; 00:00:38,920<br>So state machines come up in at least those circumstances and many others.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:38,920 –&gt; 00:00:43,719<br>Now the general model of state machine involves the idea that you can give it input and response to them,</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:43,719 –&gt; 00:00:47,480<br>but we don’t really need that for our purposes.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:47,480 –&gt; 00:00:50,480<br>So let’s look at our example of a state machine.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:50,480 –&gt; 00:00:53,280<br>Here’s a particular simple one.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:53,280 –&gt; 00:00:59,200<br>This is a description of a state machine that counts to 99.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:59,200 –&gt; 00:01:02,039<br>So the circles are indicating what its states are.</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,039 –&gt; 00:01:05,519<br>We’ve named them from 0 through 99.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:05,519 –&gt; 00:01:08,079<br>And then there’s a final state called overflow.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:08,079 –&gt; 00:01:17,640<br>And that funny arc is an indication that if you’re in overflow mode and you make another step by following the arc,</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:17,640 –&gt; 00:01:19,480<br>you get back to overflow mode.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:19,480 –&gt; 00:01:22,280<br>But if you’re in 0, you can make a step to 1.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:22,280 –&gt; 00:01:25,120<br>And if you’re in 1, you can make a step to 2 and so on.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:25,120 –&gt; 00:01:35,359<br>So starting off at the start state, which is generally indicated by that double mark,</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:35,359 –&gt; 00:01:43,920<br>so to indicate where to start, then the description of this machine consists in complete description is a set of states,</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,920 –&gt; 00:01:47,640<br>which are pictured as 0 through 99 plus overflow.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:47,640 –&gt; 00:01:54,799<br>A set of transitions, which are indicated by the arrows, which is how one state can move to another state.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:54,799 –&gt; 00:02:02,840<br>And the transitions can be summarized by saying that there of the form i to i plus 1 for i between 0 and 99.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:02,840 –&gt; 00:02:09,400<br>And then there’s a 99 transition to overflow and once you’re in overflow, you stay in overflow.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:09,400 –&gt; 00:02:15,759<br>So the picture at the top is saying exactly the same thing as we’ve said here in mathematical notation,</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:15,759 –&gt; 00:02:18,959<br>explicitly describing what the transitions are.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:18,959 –&gt; 00:02:22,959<br>So this is a machine that if you really built something that behaved this way,</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:22,959 –&gt; 00:02:27,639<br>it wouldn’t be much used because once it’s overflowed, it’s dead because it stays there.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:27,639 –&gt; 00:02:32,439<br>Real machine to be useful would have a reset transition, which took overflow back to 0.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:32,439 –&gt; 00:02:37,159<br>But this illustrates the basic idea.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:37,159 –&gt; 00:02:41,199<br>So let’s look at a fun example from a diehard movie,</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:41,199 –&gt; 00:02:43,519<br>I’ve forgotten which one it was.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:43,519 –&gt; 00:02:51,519<br>But there was one with Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson playing a detective and a friend that he meets who helps him.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:51,519 –&gt; 00:02:58,519<br>Deal with a madman, as is the case in all these movies, this time the madman’s name is Simon.</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:58,519 –&gt; 00:03:04,639<br>And what Simon says to them as they stand behind the fountain in the park shown on the previous slide is</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:04,639 –&gt; 00:03:06,560<br>that on the fountain there should be two jugs.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:06,560 –&gt; 00:03:07,679<br>Do you see them?</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:07,679 –&gt; 00:03:09,799<br>A five gallon and a three gallon.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:09,800 –&gt; 00:03:16,040<br>Fill one of these jugs with exactly four gallons of water and place it on the scale and the timer will stop.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:16,040 –&gt; 00:03:21,040<br>The timer and the scale are not shown in that picture, but there’s a scale and a timer nearby.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:21,040 –&gt; 00:03:22,280<br>You must be precise.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:22,280 –&gt; 00:03:25,120<br>One ounce more or less will result in that nation.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:25,120 –&gt; 00:03:29,320<br>If you’re still alive in five minutes, we’ll speak.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:29,320 –&gt; 00:03:34,720<br>Okay, so let’s think about formalizing this as a state machine to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:34,719 –&gt; 00:03:47,360<br>So the first of all to understand the specification informally what there is is a three gallon jug and a five gallon jug that is capable of holding water.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:47,360 –&gt; 00:03:52,280<br>And an unlimited supply of water that you can get from a fountain.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:52,280 –&gt; 00:03:56,319<br>And the basic moves that you can make.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:56,319 –&gt; 00:04:03,719<br>So with this setup, the kind of moves that you can make would be say you fill up the three gallon jug with water.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:03,719 –&gt; 00:04:07,159<br>And then you could pour the three gallon jug into the five gallon jugs.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:07,159 –&gt; 00:04:14,560<br>So the three gallon jug was empty and the five gallon jug you knew had exactly three gallons in it.</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:14,560 –&gt; 00:04:20,399<br>And then you can do other things like empty a jug and fill a jug and empty them into each other.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:20,399 –&gt; 00:04:23,759<br>So let’s model this as a state machine.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:23,759 –&gt; 00:04:27,600<br>And the first decision we need to make is what’s the state going to be?</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:27,600 –&gt; 00:04:32,680<br>Well, the state of the obvious model for the state is the amount of water in each of the jugs.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:32,680 –&gt; 00:04:36,800<br>So B is the amount in the big jug and L is the amount in the little jug.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:36,800 –&gt; 00:04:44,800<br>And what we know about B and L is that there going to be some amount between zero and five for B and zero and three for L.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:44,800 –&gt; 00:04:48,759<br>Where we’re going to quickly realize that we need them to be integers.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:48,759 –&gt; 00:04:57,879<br>But offhand, we can allow them to be real numbers because after all, you could just pour some arbitrary amount of water into the big jug.</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:57,879 –&gt; 00:05:04,600<br>Any amount that will hold between zero and five, although that will be dangerous because as soon as you do that,</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:04,600 –&gt; 00:05:10,600<br>you’re going to lose track of exactly how much is in there and you won’t know when you have four gallons or not.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:10,600 –&gt; 00:05:14,800<br>So let’s formalize the possible moves that we can have.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:14,800 –&gt; 00:05:19,399<br>So first of all, the start state is zero zero because we start with both jugs empty.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:19,399 –&gt; 00:05:24,120<br>And then what are the possible transitions of how B and L moves?</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:24,120 –&gt; 00:05:25,600<br>Well, let’s see.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:25,600 –&gt; 00:05:32,720<br>The fill the little jug move amounts to saying that if you have an amount of B in big and L in little,</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:32,720 –&gt; 00:05:42,480<br>then you can make a transition called fill the little jug into B in big, still unchanged and three in little for L less than three.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:42,480 –&gt; 00:05:48,639<br>I’m going to forbid the vacuous move where the little jug is already full and you try to fill it.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:48,639 –&gt; 00:05:49,560<br>That doesn’t count.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:49,560 –&gt; 00:05:53,959<br>So L has to be less than three and you can make it three by filling the little jug.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:53,959 –&gt; 00:05:59,919<br>Similarly, you can fill the big jug if B is less than five than you can turn it into five by filling it.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:59,919 –&gt; 00:06:02,759<br>And then you can empty the little jug, which is easy.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:02,759 –&gt; 00:06:05,719<br>If you go from B, L, you go to B zero.</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:05,719 –&gt; 00:06:07,319<br>And likewise, you can empty the big jug.</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:07,319 –&gt; 00:06:09,199<br>Those are the easy moves.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:09,199 –&gt; 00:06:13,799<br>A slightly more complicated move is pour the big jug into the little jug.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:13,799 –&gt; 00:06:19,279<br>Well, if there’s no overflow, what that means is that there’s L in the little jug and B in the big jug.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:19,279 –&gt; 00:06:26,519<br>And after you’ve poured the big jug into the little jug, there’s B plus L in the little one and nothing in the big one.</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:26,519 –&gt; 00:06:29,239<br>But let’s be careful here about what exactly we’re doing.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:29,239 –&gt; 00:06:32,719<br>Math, we’re not sort of trying to get away from the metaphor.</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:32,719 –&gt; 00:06:36,239<br>So what is no overflow means, it simply means that B plus L will fit.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:36,239 –&gt; 00:06:39,000<br>B plus L is less than or equal to three.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:39,000 –&gt; 00:06:39,759<br>All right.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:39,759 –&gt; 00:06:43,799<br>What’s the other case of pouring the big jug into the little jug?</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:43,799 –&gt; 00:06:46,959<br>Well, that’s when B plus L won’t fit.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:46,959 –&gt; 00:06:50,519<br>In which case, you pour into the little jug.</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:50,519 –&gt; 00:06:54,680<br>It’s got L, so you pour in three minus L to fill it up.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:54,680 –&gt; 00:06:59,680<br>And then what’s left in B is B minus the three minus little L that you poured.</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:59,680 –&gt; 00:07:03,959<br>So that’s the otherwise case when there is overflow.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:03,959 –&gt; 00:07:09,199<br>And similarly, there are moves for pouring the little jug into the big jug.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:09,199 –&gt; 00:07:16,439<br>So that then is a formal specification of the dieharc machine and the moves that we’re going to allow.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:16,439 –&gt; 00:07:20,560<br>Now you could allow other moves like randomly pouring out a little water or randomly filling</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:20,560 –&gt; 00:07:21,759<br>up a little water.</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:21,759 –&gt; 00:07:25,399<br>But if you did that again, you’ll lose track of how much water is in the jug.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:25,399 –&gt; 00:07:29,959<br>So these are the only safe moves and they’re the only ones we’re going to model.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:29,959 –&gt; 00:07:30,959<br>All right.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:30,959 –&gt; 00:07:32,959<br>So let’s go back to Simon’s challenge.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:32,959 –&gt; 00:07:39,759<br>He wants to disarm the bomb by getting exactly four gallons of water in a jug and measure</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:39,759 –&gt; 00:07:43,720<br>it on the scale or things will blow up.</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:43,720 –&gt; 00:07:45,480<br>And how do you do it?</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:45,560 –&gt; 00:07:53,319<br>Well, why don’t you take a moment to think about it before I proceed to the next set of slides</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:53,319 –&gt; 00:07:55,080<br>or before you let me proceed.</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:55,080 –&gt; 00:07:59,319<br>But just to understand the rules again and watch the work, here’s how.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:59,319 –&gt; 00:08:04,400<br>We’re going to start off with both jugs empty.</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:04,400 –&gt; 00:08:06,759<br>So we start off in state zero zero.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:06,759 –&gt; 00:08:12,720<br>And the first move is going to be to fill the big jug, which takes us to state five zero,</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:12,720 –&gt; 00:08:16,640<br>where the big jug has five and the little jug is still empty.</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:16,640 –&gt; 00:08:20,040<br>Then we’re going to pour from the big into the little.</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:20,040 –&gt; 00:08:23,120<br>So now the little jug has three.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:23,120 –&gt; 00:08:24,680<br>We’re filling up the little one.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:24,680 –&gt; 00:08:28,040<br>That leaves two in the big jug.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:28,040 –&gt; 00:08:29,400<br>Now we’re going to empty the little one.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:29,400 –&gt; 00:08:32,680<br>We still have two left in the big one.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:32,680 –&gt; 00:08:36,399<br>And now we’re going to pour from the big one into the little one.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:36,399 –&gt; 00:08:40,519<br>So the little one has two gallons and the big one is empty.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:40,519 –&gt; 00:08:46,399<br>Now we fill the big jug and there’s still two gallons in the little one and five gallons</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:46,399 –&gt; 00:08:47,399<br>in the big one.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:47,399 –&gt; 00:08:53,840<br>Now we pour off from the five gallon jug until the one gallon jug is full.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:53,840 –&gt; 00:08:59,319<br>That’s removing the one gallon that the three gallon jug still has capacity for.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:59,319 –&gt; 00:09:04,600<br>We reduce to full three gallons in the little jug and four gallons are target in the big</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:04,600 –&gt; 00:09:06,000<br>jug.</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:06,000 –&gt; 00:09:09,319<br>And so we’ve accomplished it.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:09,319 –&gt; 00:09:10,439<br>And we’re done.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:10,440 –&gt; 00:09:12,040<br>So the bomb doesn’t go off.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:12,040 –&gt; 00:09:13,040<br>All right.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:13,040 –&gt; 00:09:17,040<br>So the point of this exercise is really just to practice how the moves work and what the</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:17,040 –&gt; 00:09:18,520<br>states are.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:18,520 –&gt; 00:09:25,120<br>But the question that I want to raise is suppose that we want to have a die hard once</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:25,120 –&gt; 00:09:29,880<br>in for all scenario, in which we’re tired of the remakes of these movies.</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:29,880 –&gt; 00:09:36,680<br>And we propose that in the next movie that Simon, if he’s still around, offers an alternative</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:36,679 –&gt; 00:09:41,120<br>challenge, or instead of a three gallon and a five gallon jug, there’s a three gallon</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:41,120 –&gt; 00:09:44,399<br>jug and a nine gallon jug.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:44,399 –&gt; 00:09:52,399<br>And now the question is, can you get four gallons into the big jug by pouring back and forth</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:52,399 –&gt; 00:09:58,120<br>with rules like these or can’t show and can you prove it?</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:58,120 –&gt; 00:10:04,919<br>Well my guess is that you probably can figure out what’s going on because what’s happening</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:04,919 –&gt; 00:10:11,159<br>is if you start off with nothing in either jug and you do these moves of filling up a</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:11,159 –&gt; 00:10:18,919<br>jug, pouring one jug into another, you’ll discover that the amount of water in any jug is always</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:18,919 –&gt; 00:10:21,000<br>divisible by three.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:21,000 –&gt; 00:10:23,240<br>This is a preserved invariant.</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:23,240 –&gt; 00:10:28,439<br>Any state that you can get to starting off from zero zero, three will divide the number</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:28,439 –&gt; 00:10:31,120<br>of gallons in each jug.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:31,120 –&gt; 00:10:32,399<br>We could state it this way.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:32,399 –&gt; 00:10:38,200<br>There’s a property of states, property of B and L, which is the state, which is that three</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:38,200 –&gt; 00:10:43,720<br>divides be that vertical line is a shorthand for the simple divides.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:43,720 –&gt; 00:10:48,960<br>So three divides be or B is a multiple of three, three divides L, sin and L is a multiple</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:48,960 –&gt; 00:10:49,960<br>of three.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:49,960 –&gt; 00:10:54,039<br>And the claim is that that’s always going to be true.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:54,039 –&gt; 00:10:58,159<br>So in case that’s not obvious, you might not have all the rules in your head.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:58,159 –&gt; 00:11:00,959<br>Let’s just take a look at one of the more complicated rules.</p>
<p>149<br>00:11:00,959 –&gt; 00:11:06,240<br>This was the rule where you’re pouring the big jug into the little jug up until the</p>
<p>150<br>00:11:06,240 –&gt; 00:11:09,399<br>little jug is full.</p>
<p>151<br>00:11:09,399 –&gt; 00:11:15,759<br>And that transition is that if you’re in state, B L, you move to B minus three minus L and</p>
<p>152<br>00:11:15,759 –&gt; 00:11:17,360<br>three.</p>
<p>153<br>00:11:17,360 –&gt; 00:11:23,959<br>And if you look at this now clearly, if three divides both B and L, both components of</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:23,959 –&gt; 00:11:28,120<br>the state you’re at, then in the new state, well three obviously divides the contents</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:28,120 –&gt; 00:11:33,120<br>of the little jug, which is three, but three also divides the contents of the big jug,</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:33,120 –&gt; 00:11:38,200<br>which is a multiple of three, namely B minus three, which is a multiple of three minus</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:38,200 –&gt; 00:11:40,399<br>double, which is a multiple of three.</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:40,399 –&gt; 00:11:45,000<br>When you take a linear combination of multiples of three, you get a multiple of three.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:45,000 –&gt; 00:11:48,279<br>And you look at all the other transitions and they check equally well.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:48,279 –&gt; 00:11:55,000<br>If you’re in a state, B L, and you move to a new state, B prime L prime, if three divides</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:55,000 –&gt; 00:11:58,960<br>B and L, then three divides B prime and L prime.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:58,960 –&gt; 00:12:04,799<br>So this is what’s called a preserved invariant.</p>
<p>163<br>00:12:04,799 –&gt; 00:12:09,039<br>And of course, the corollary is that in the diehard ones, and for all game with the three</p>
<p>164<br>00:12:09,039 –&gt; 00:12:14,320<br>jug, three gallon jug, and the nine gallon jug, you can’t get to any state of the form</p>
<p>165<br>00:12:14,320 –&gt; 00:12:21,759<br>4x because 4 is not divisible by 3, and therefore Bruce is going to die.</p>
<p>166<br>00:12:21,759 –&gt; 00:12:27,759<br>Now what we illustrated here is an argument that’s known as Floyd’s invariant principle,</p>
<p>167<br>00:12:27,759 –&gt; 00:12:31,600<br>and it’s really nothing but induction reformulated for state machines.</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:31,600 –&gt; 00:12:38,000<br>The statement of Floyd’s invariant principle is that we’re going to define a preserved invariant</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:38,000 –&gt; 00:12:42,840<br>as a property of states, and a preserved invariant means it has the property that if you’re in</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:42,840 –&gt; 00:12:50,639<br>a state that has property P, and it’s possible to make a single transition to a state R, then</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:50,639 –&gt; 00:12:54,679<br>R will also have property P. This is just like the induction step.</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:54,679 –&gt; 00:12:58,720<br>You have to prove that P of N implies P of N plus 1.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:58,720 –&gt; 00:13:08,399<br>So if you have a preserved invariant, then if the property holds at the start state,</p>
<p>174<br>00:13:08,399 –&gt; 00:13:14,319<br>then it’s obvious that the property will hold for all of the states that you can possibly</p>
<p>175<br>00:13:14,319 –&gt; 00:13:18,120<br>get to, that P of R will hold for all reachable states.</p>
<p>176<br>00:13:18,120 –&gt; 00:13:21,560<br>You can prove this by induction on the number of states, but I think it’s clear that if</p>
<p>177<br>00:13:21,560 –&gt; 00:13:26,039<br>you have a property that you begin with and it doesn’t change making a step, it’s never</p>
<p>178<br>00:13:26,039 –&gt; 00:13:27,399<br>going to change.</p>
<p>179<br>00:13:27,399 –&gt; 00:13:30,679<br>And that’s all that Floyd’s invariant principle states.</p>
<p>180<br>00:13:30,679 –&gt; 00:13:36,460<br>So in particular, since the property P holds in all reachable states, if there is any</p>
<p>181<br>00:13:36,460 –&gt; 00:13:42,759<br>final state which the machine reaches, then P is going to hold in that state.</p>
<p>182<br>00:13:42,759 –&gt; 00:13:48,200<br>And what we saw was that, and so we’re using the word preserved invariant to distinguish</p>
<p>183<br>00:13:48,200 –&gt; 00:13:55,759<br>the definition here from another usage that’s co-opted the word invariant to mean a property</p>
<p>184<br>00:13:55,759 –&gt; 00:13:58,319<br>that’s true in all states.</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:58,319 –&gt; 00:14:03,240<br>And while it’s nice to know that some property is true in all states, the way you prove that</p>
<p>186<br>00:14:03,240 –&gt; 00:14:04,960<br>is by having a preserved invariant.</p>
<p>187<br>00:14:04,960 –&gt; 00:14:06,480<br>So you want it distinguished it to.</p>
<p>188<br>00:14:06,480 –&gt; 00:14:11,679<br>Technically, if you look at this, the predicate that’s always false is a preserved invariant</p>
<p>189<br>00:14:11,679 –&gt; 00:14:16,839<br>because of the condition, as usual, the way implication works if the antecedent is</p>
<p>190<br>00:14:16,839 –&gt; 00:14:20,120<br>false, then the entire implication is true.</p>
<p>191<br>00:14:20,120 –&gt; 00:14:26,279<br>So if you’re always false, then it’s always the case that if false held in a state which</p>
<p>192<br>00:14:26,279 –&gt; 00:14:32,039<br>it never does, then it has to hold in any state you can get to so that implication is true.</p>
<p>193<br>00:14:32,039 –&gt; 00:14:38,039<br>So just remember that preserved invariants that are constantly false exist.</p>
<p>194<br>00:14:38,039 –&gt; 00:14:42,360<br>They are good preserved invariants, but they’re not what other people would call an invariant.</p>
<p>195<br>00:14:42,360 –&gt; 00:14:47,879<br>We use preserved invariants to prove that a property is true in all states.</p>
<p>196<br>00:14:47,879 –&gt; 00:14:52,039<br>It’s a methodology.</p>
<p>197<br>00:14:52,039 –&gt; 00:14:54,480<br>So let’s do one more example to wrap this up.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:54,480 –&gt; 00:15:00,399<br>Suppose I have a robot on a grid and the integer grid, and we can think then of the coordinates</p>
<p>199<br>00:15:00,399 –&gt; 00:15:05,480<br>of the integer as a pair, the coordinates of the robot as the coordinates of the square</p>
<p>200<br>00:15:05,480 –&gt; 00:15:09,600<br>that it’s in a pair of non-negative integers.</p>
<p>201<br>00:15:09,600 –&gt; 00:15:14,840<br>Now the way this robot can move is it can make a diagonal move in one step.</p>
<p>202<br>00:15:14,840 –&gt; 00:15:20,480<br>So it can move one step to the northeast or southeast or northwest or southwest, and that’s</p>
<p>203<br>00:15:20,480 –&gt; 00:15:21,480<br>it.</p>
<p>204<br>00:15:21,480 –&gt; 00:15:26,080<br>And the question that I want to ask is suppose you start the robot off at the origin at</p>
<p>205<br>00:15:26,080 –&gt; 00:15:27,759<br>0, 0.</p>
<p>206<br>00:15:27,759 –&gt; 00:15:33,159<br>Is there some way that it can wander around following its moves and get to a net state where it’s</p>
<p>207<br>00:15:33,159 –&gt; 00:15:34,519<br>moved one square over?</p>
<p>208<br>00:15:34,519 –&gt; 00:15:40,079<br>That is, it gets to the square 0, 1.</p>
<p>209<br>00:15:40,079 –&gt; 00:15:44,639<br>And the answer to that is settled again by a preserved invariant.</p>
<p>210<br>00:15:44,639 –&gt; 00:15:48,919<br>I don’t know whether it’s obvious to you yet, but it will be in a moment.</p>
<p>211<br>00:15:48,919 –&gt; 00:15:52,079<br>I’m claiming you can’t get to the square 0, 1.</p>
<p>212<br>00:15:52,079 –&gt; 00:15:58,039<br>And the reason is that there’s a preserved invariant of that set of robot moves.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:58,039 –&gt; 00:16:03,000<br>Similarly, the sum of the coordinates is even, is an invariant.</p>
<p>214<br>00:16:03,000 –&gt; 00:16:06,559<br>If the sum of the coordinates is even, it stays even.</p>
<p>215<br>00:16:06,559 –&gt; 00:16:07,559<br>And why is that?</p>
<p>216<br>00:16:07,559 –&gt; 00:16:17,120<br>Well, any move adds plus or minus 1 to the coordinates of both x and y.</p>
<p>217<br>00:16:17,120 –&gt; 00:16:23,839<br>Maybe x and y both go up by 1, in which case the sum of x and y increases by 2.</p>
<p>218<br>00:16:23,839 –&gt; 00:16:28,000<br>So if it was even, it stays even, or they both go down by 1, or maybe 1 goes up in</p>
<p>219<br>00:16:28,000 –&gt; 00:16:31,279<br>the other goes down, in which case the sum doesn’t change.</p>
<p>220<br>00:16:31,279 –&gt; 00:16:35,840<br>In every case, if x plus y was even, it stays even.</p>
<p>221<br>00:16:35,840 –&gt; 00:16:39,200<br>And as a matter of fact, if it was odd, it stays odd.</p>
<p>222<br>00:16:39,200 –&gt; 00:16:41,879<br>Moves actually preserve the parity of x plus y.</p>
<p>223<br>00:16:41,879 –&gt; 00:16:46,639<br>But the invariant is that x plus y is even.</p>
<p>224<br>00:16:46,639 –&gt; 00:16:48,519<br>Now, what else is the case?</p>
<p>225<br>00:16:48,519 –&gt; 00:16:54,360<br>Well, 0, 0, 0, 0 plus 0 is 0, which is even.</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:54,360 –&gt; 00:17:00,840<br>And so we’re in a Floyd invariant principle case, where all the positions you can get</p>
<p>227<br>00:17:00,840 –&gt; 00:17:07,000<br>to from the origin 0, 0, which has an even sum, have to have an even sum.</p>
<p>228<br>00:17:07,000 –&gt; 00:17:15,319<br>And since 1 plus 0 is odd, you can’t get to that square, 1, 0.</p>
<p>229<br>00:17:15,319 –&gt; 00:17:20,000<br>It’s not reachable.</p>
<p>230<br>00:17:20,000 –&gt; 00:17:27,319<br>So the parity invariant of the diagonally moving robot will set us up for an analysis of</p>
<p>231<br>00:17:27,319 –&gt; 00:17:29,000<br>the 15 puzzle game.</p>
<p>232<br>00:17:29,000 –&gt; 00:17:36,160<br>That’s this logo that we’ve had on every slide in 6042 so far with 6 blank 42 on the diagonal.</p>
<p>233<br>00:17:36,160 –&gt; 00:17:42,039<br>This is a game where there are these little numbered tiles that slide into the blank square.</p>
<p>234<br>00:17:42,039 –&gt; 00:17:47,839<br>And the question is how to permute, how to get from one permutation of the numbers to another.</p>
<p>235<br>00:17:47,839 –&gt; 00:17:53,559<br>And it turns out that the analysis of that game depends on a parity invariant reminiscent</p>
<p>236<br>00:17:53,559 –&gt; 00:17:58,839<br>of a slightly more sophisticated than the diagonally moving robot.</p>
<p>237<br>00:17:58,839 –&gt; 00:18:04,799<br>Let’s look at one more example of using the invariant to verify a little algorithm.</p>
<p>238<br>00:18:04,799 –&gt; 00:18:08,919<br>They actually will be quite important as the course progresses, and that is fast</p>
<p>239<br>00:18:08,919 –&gt; 00:18:10,399<br>exponentiation.</p>
<p>240<br>00:18:10,399 –&gt; 00:18:14,599<br>So in this setup, a is a real number, and b is a non-negative integer.</p>
<p>241<br>00:18:14,599 –&gt; 00:18:16,439<br>And I want to compute the beef power of a.</p>
<p>242<br>00:18:16,439 –&gt; 00:18:25,039<br>Let’s say b was 128, and I want to compute the 128th power of some real number a.</p>
<p>243<br>00:18:25,039 –&gt; 00:18:28,519<br>Well, I can multiply a by itself 127 times.</p>
<p>244<br>00:18:28,519 –&gt; 00:18:29,919<br>That would work fine.</p>
<p>245<br>00:18:29,919 –&gt; 00:18:35,159<br>But if you think about it, suppose I square a, and then I square it again, and I square</p>
<p>246<br>00:18:35,159 –&gt; 00:18:42,279<br>it again, then in about 8 squareings instead of 99 multiplications, I’m going to get to</p>
<p>247<br>00:18:42,279 –&gt; 00:18:44,960<br>a to 128th.</p>
<p>248<br>00:18:44,960 –&gt; 00:18:51,759<br>Now if b is not a power of two, you adjust it slightly, and using that idea, you can compute</p>
<p>249<br>00:18:51,759 –&gt; 00:18:57,920<br>the beef power of a much more rapidly than if you just naively multiplied out b minus</p>
<p>250<br>00:18:57,920 –&gt; 00:18:59,119<br>one times.</p>
<p>251<br>00:18:59,119 –&gt; 00:19:02,519<br>So let’s look at the pseudo code for this algorithm.</p>
<p>252<br>00:19:02,519 –&gt; 00:19:06,920<br>Here x, y, z, and r are temporary registers.</p>
<p>253<br>00:19:06,920 –&gt; 00:19:14,320<br>y and z hold, y, z and r, all hold integers, and x holds this real number a.</p>
<p>254<br>00:19:14,320 –&gt; 00:19:19,519<br>And you can read the code if you wish, but in fact, I’m going to immediately jump to</p>
<p>255<br>00:19:19,519 –&gt; 00:19:24,279<br>the slightly more abstract and easier to understand version of it as a state machine.</p>
<p>256<br>00:19:24,279 –&gt; 00:19:29,440<br>So what matters about this fast exponentiation algorithm as a state machine is that first</p>
<p>257<br>00:19:29,440 –&gt; 00:19:39,640<br>of all, there are three states, two real numbers and a non-negative integer.</p>
<p>258<br>00:19:39,640 –&gt; 00:19:46,080<br>And the start state is going to be that the number a is in the first register, or in the</p>
<p>259<br>00:19:46,080 –&gt; 00:19:49,080<br>first location, first coordinate of the states.</p>
<p>260<br>00:19:49,080 –&gt; 00:19:55,320<br>One is the real number in the second coordinate, and b, the target exponent, is the non-negative</p>
<p>261<br>00:19:55,320 –&gt; 00:19:59,240<br>integer in the third component.</p>
<p>262<br>00:19:59,240 –&gt; 00:20:01,120<br>The transitions are going to be as follows.</p>
<p>263<br>00:20:01,120 –&gt; 00:20:02,960<br>Here’s a simple one.</p>
<p>264<br>00:20:02,960 –&gt; 00:20:10,799<br>If I have an amount x in the first location, y in the second location, z in the third, then</p>
<p>265<br>00:20:10,799 –&gt; 00:20:20,039<br>if z is positive and even, then I’m going to square x, leave y alone, and divide z by</p>
<p>266<br>00:20:20,039 –&gt; 00:20:21,880<br>totally.</p>
<p>267<br>00:20:21,880 –&gt; 00:20:23,640<br>And that’s the new state that I get at.</p>
<p>268<br>00:20:23,640 –&gt; 00:20:29,200<br>On the other hand, if z is odd and positive, then I’m going to square x.</p>
<p>269<br>00:20:29,600 –&gt; 00:20:37,600<br>Multiply y by x, and again, take the quotient of z, divide z by two.</p>
<p>270<br>00:20:37,600 –&gt; 00:20:42,000<br>Okay, why does this state machine do fast exponentiation?</p>
<p>271<br>00:20:42,000 –&gt; 00:20:42,840<br>Why is it correct?</p>
<p>272<br>00:20:42,840 –&gt; 00:20:46,920<br>And the insight is that there’s a preserved invariant of this machine.</p>
<p>273<br>00:20:46,920 –&gt; 00:20:53,840<br>And the preserved invariant is that y times x to the z is always a to the b.</p>
<p>274<br>00:20:53,839 –&gt; 00:21:00,119<br>So let’s see how to verify that, that y x to the z is equal to a to the b.</p>
<p>275<br>00:21:00,119 –&gt; 00:21:06,279<br>Well, let’s just look at maybe this like the more interesting of the two transition rules,</p>
<p>276<br>00:21:06,279 –&gt; 00:21:13,799<br>which is when z is positive and odd, the x, y, z state moves to a new state indicated</p>
<p>277<br>00:21:13,799 –&gt; 00:21:18,720<br>in green, where the new value of x is x squared, the new value of y is x, y.</p>
<p>278<br>00:21:18,720 –&gt; 00:21:22,119<br>And the new value of z is z minus 1 over 2.</p>
<p>279<br>00:21:22,119 –&gt; 00:21:27,359<br>Remember, you went to the quotient of z divided by 2, and when z is odd, that means z minus,</p>
<p>280<br>00:21:27,359 –&gt; 00:21:29,719<br>it’s literally z minus 1 over 2.</p>
<p>281<br>00:21:29,719 –&gt; 00:21:36,239<br>Well, do the new values satisfy the invariant if I plug in the green values of x squared</p>
<p>282<br>00:21:36,239 –&gt; 00:21:44,759<br>for y and x squared for x, x, y for y and z minus 1 over 2 for z.</p>
<p>283<br>00:21:44,759 –&gt; 00:21:47,199<br>Well, let’s see what happens.</p>
<p>284<br>00:21:47,200 –&gt; 00:21:56,200<br>If I take the new value of y, which is x, y, and I multiply it by the new value of x,</p>
<p>285<br>00:21:56,200 –&gt; 00:22:01,960<br>which is x squared, raised to the new value of z, which is z minus 1 over 2,</p>
<p>286<br>00:22:01,960 –&gt; 00:22:04,840<br>let’s do a little algebraic simplification of that.</p>
<p>287<br>00:22:04,840 –&gt; 00:22:10,039<br>Well, the x squared to the z minus 1 over 2 becomes x to the z minus 1,</p>
<p>288<br>00:22:10,039 –&gt; 00:22:13,120<br>and I’m just carrying over the x, y.</p>
<p>289<br>00:22:13,119 –&gt; 00:22:21,199<br>And then that simplifies to simply y times x times x to the z minus 1, or y x to the z,</p>
<p>290<br>00:22:21,199 –&gt; 00:22:23,799<br>which we assumed was equal to a to the b.</p>
<p>291<br>00:22:23,799 –&gt; 00:22:28,719<br>So sure enough, the new values of x, y, and z satisfy the invariant.</p>
<p>292<br>00:22:28,719 –&gt; 00:22:34,079<br>It is a preserved invariant, and an even simpler argument applies to the other transition</p>
<p>293<br>00:22:34,079 –&gt; 00:22:36,439<br>when z is positive and even.</p>
<p>294<br>00:22:36,439 –&gt; 00:22:40,239<br>So we’ve verified that this is a preserved invariant.</p>
<p>295<br>00:22:40,240 –&gt; 00:22:47,640<br>Now, at the start, remember, we start off with the real number a and register x,</p>
<p>296<br>00:22:47,640 –&gt; 00:22:54,400<br>the real number b in z, and the real number 1 in y, which is the accumulator,</p>
<p>297<br>00:22:54,400 –&gt; 00:22:57,559<br>and one times a to the b is equal to a to the b.</p>
<p>298<br>00:22:57,559 –&gt; 00:23:01,839<br>So this preserved invariant is true of the start state.</p>
<p>299<br>00:23:01,839 –&gt; 00:23:08,079<br>And that means by Floyd’s invariant principle that it is true at the final state,</p>
<p>300<br>00:23:08,079 –&gt; 00:23:10,039<br>if and when the thing stops.</p>
<p>301<br>00:23:10,039 –&gt; 00:23:12,240<br>Well, when does this machine stop?</p>
<p>302<br>00:23:12,240 –&gt; 00:23:14,960<br>As long as z is positive, it can keep moving.</p>
<p>303<br>00:23:14,960 –&gt; 00:23:18,159<br>So it gets stuck when z is 0.</p>
<p>304<br>00:23:18,159 –&gt; 00:23:22,559<br>What happens if it ever gets to z is 0, if it gets stuck?</p>
<p>305<br>00:23:22,559 –&gt; 00:23:29,159<br>Then the invariant says that y x to the 0 has to equal to a to the b.</p>
<p>306<br>00:23:29,159 –&gt; 00:23:32,480<br>But of course, y x to the 0 is nothing but y.</p>
<p>307<br>00:23:32,480 –&gt; 00:23:37,960<br>And what we conclude is that sure enough, this machine leaves the desired exponential</p>
<p>308<br>00:23:37,960 –&gt; 00:23:42,440<br>value in the register y, which is where we get the answer.</p>
<p>309<br>00:23:42,440 –&gt; 00:23:47,440<br>And that’s why this algorithm is correct.</p>
<p>310<br>00:23:47,440 –&gt; 00:23:54,960<br>Now, another aspect of what’s going on here is proving that the algorithm does terminate.</p>
<p>311<br>00:23:54,960 –&gt; 00:24:01,440<br>So let me just say a word that Floyd distinguished sort of these two aspects of program</p>
<p>312<br>00:24:01,440 –&gt; 00:24:02,960<br>correctness that typically come up.</p>
<p>313<br>00:24:02,960 –&gt; 00:24:05,680<br>One is showing that if you get an answer, it’s correct.</p>
<p>314<br>00:24:05,680 –&gt; 00:24:07,279<br>And that’s what we just did.</p>
<p>315<br>00:24:07,279 –&gt; 00:24:13,319<br>If this machine stops, if it ever gets to the case where z is 0, then y has the right</p>
<p>316<br>00:24:13,319 –&gt; 00:24:14,319<br>answer.</p>
<p>317<br>00:24:14,319 –&gt; 00:24:16,319<br>But we haven’t proved that it stops.</p>
<p>318<br>00:24:16,319 –&gt; 00:24:21,399<br>So we’ve shown that it’s partially correct like a partial function.</p>
<p>319<br>00:24:21,399 –&gt; 00:24:23,000<br>It might not be defined everywhere.</p>
<p>320<br>00:24:23,000 –&gt; 00:24:24,000<br>We haven’t shown that yet.</p>
<p>321<br>00:24:24,000 –&gt; 00:24:26,079<br>But when it is defined, it gives the right answer.</p>
<p>322<br>00:24:26,079 –&gt; 00:24:31,680<br>And the other aspect of correctness is termination, showing in effect that the function is total,</p>
<p>323<br>00:24:31,680 –&gt; 00:24:33,920<br>that the program always does stop.</p>
<p>324<br>00:24:33,920 –&gt; 00:24:40,000<br>Well, in this case, there’s an easy way to see why it always stops because in every transition,</p>
<p>325<br>00:24:40,000 –&gt; 00:24:42,920<br>z is being halved or more.</p>
<p>326<br>00:24:42,920 –&gt; 00:24:48,920<br>Z is a non-negative integer valued variable.</p>
<p>327<br>00:24:48,920 –&gt; 00:24:55,200<br>And since we’re having it or making it even smaller than half of it at every step, it</p>
<p>328<br>00:24:55,200 –&gt; 00:25:02,440<br>means that since it starts with the value z, it can’t get smaller more than log to the</p>
<p>329<br>00:25:02,440 –&gt; 00:25:06,240<br>base 2 of b times because by then it would have hit 0.</p>
<p>330<br>00:25:06,240 –&gt; 00:25:12,759<br>And so we can be sure that this machine makes it most log to the base 2 of b transitions.</p>
<p>331<br>00:25:12,759 –&gt; 00:25:17,680<br>And then it has to get stuck at the only place that it can stuck, which is when z equals</p>
<p>332<br>00:25:17,680 –&gt; 00:25:19,360<br>0.</p>
<p>333<br>00:25:19,360 –&gt; 00:25:27,360<br>And there is a picture of my friend and early colleague, Bob Floyd, whom I met at the very</p>
<p>334<br>00:25:27,360 –&gt; 00:25:31,480<br>beginning of my career at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>335<br>00:25:31,480 –&gt; 00:25:35,039<br>We worked together for about one year before he went off to Stanford.</p>
<p>336<br>00:25:35,039 –&gt; 00:25:44,120<br>And you can read much more about his life in a warm and detailed eulogy written by his best</p>
<p>337<br>00:25:44,120 –&gt; 00:25:46,799<br>friend, Don Knuth.</p>
<p>338<br>00:25:46,799 –&gt; 00:25:53,319<br>Floyd won the Touring Award and made his major contributions, both to program correctness</p>
<p>339<br>00:25:53,319 –&gt; 00:25:56,160<br>and to programming language parsing.</p>
