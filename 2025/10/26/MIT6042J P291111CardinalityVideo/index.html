                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:10,560<br>Cardinality is the word that’s used to refer to the size of infinite sets.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:10,560 –&gt; 00:00:15,720<br>And before we go further, let’s take a quick look at why we’re interested in infinite</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,720 –&gt; 00:00:19,559<br>sets in a course that’s mathematics for computer scientists.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,559 –&gt; 00:00:22,679<br>Why does computer science care about infinite sets?</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:22,679 –&gt; 00:00:28,000<br>Well, you know, like every data structure that you’d examine in computer memory is finite</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,000 –&gt; 00:00:31,879<br>and the integers individually are finite.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:31,879 –&gt; 00:00:34,520<br>They only calculate with finite things.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:34,520 –&gt; 00:00:39,280<br>But the infinite abstraction happens right at the beginning, although any given integer</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:39,280 –&gt; 00:00:40,280<br>is finite.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:40,280 –&gt; 00:00:42,120<br>The set of all integers is infinite.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:42,120 –&gt; 00:00:49,679<br>And although any given matrix is finite, the set of all the matrices that might be represented</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:49,679 –&gt; 00:00:54,240<br>in a computation are finite, our infinite set.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:54,240 –&gt; 00:01:00,679<br>So we take infinite sets for granted and reason about them all the time.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:00,679 –&gt; 00:01:07,240<br>The second, from a pedagogical point of view, introducing the concept of infinite sets</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:07,240 –&gt; 00:01:13,760<br>and reasoning about them carefully forces you to go beyond your intuition and really follow</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:13,760 –&gt; 00:01:19,200<br>the rules and reason in a careful mathematical way, because although some properties that</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:19,200 –&gt; 00:01:23,520<br>you’re familiar with from finite sets carry over to infinite sets, others don’t.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:23,519 –&gt; 00:01:28,119<br>In order to know which is which, you have to be thinking carefully about the rules and</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:28,119 –&gt; 00:01:34,439<br>properties that they have as opposed to just going by intuition and familiar properties.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:34,439 –&gt; 00:01:43,679<br>And finally, the reasoning that goes into comparing the sizes of infinite sets, which is the</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:43,679 –&gt; 00:01:50,840<br>topic of today’s video, has profound implications in computer science because it leads to the</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:50,840 –&gt; 00:01:58,920<br>insight about the logical limits of computation and examples of specific problems that computers</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:58,920 –&gt; 00:02:03,000<br>can’t solve, which we’ll be taking up in a later video.</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:03,000 –&gt; 00:02:07,760<br>But for now, let’s go back to the topic of cardinality.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:07,760 –&gt; 00:02:16,199<br>So there was this mathematician in the 19th century, late 19th century named Cantor, who</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:16,199 –&gt; 00:02:22,039<br>was actually working on a Fourier series and he discovered that the kind of series that</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:22,039 –&gt; 00:02:28,519<br>he was working with diverged at infinite in many places, which sounds kind of bad, but</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:28,519 –&gt; 00:02:34,280<br>he wanted to get across the idea that it didn’t diverge in very many infinite places.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:34,280 –&gt; 00:02:38,759<br>And that led him to this idea of comparing the sizes of infinite sets.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:38,759 –&gt; 00:02:41,280<br>So this is Cantor’s idea.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:41,280 –&gt; 00:02:47,520<br>So you know from the mapping lemma that if you’re looking at finite sets A and B, then</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:47,520 –&gt; 00:02:53,000<br>the size of A is greater than or equal to the size of B. If and only if A surges B, where</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:53,000 –&gt; 00:02:59,159<br>surges this technical relation, which means there exists a surjective function from A to</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:59,159 –&gt; 00:03:06,439<br>B that is a function with greater than or equal to one arrow into every element of B.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:06,439 –&gt; 00:03:09,560<br>And Cantor’s idea was saying, well, it works fine for finite sets.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:09,560 –&gt; 00:03:16,319<br>Why don’t we take this as the definition of what we mean by A is at least the size of</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:16,319 –&gt; 00:03:17,599<br>B for infinite sets.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:17,599 –&gt; 00:03:25,360<br>So we’re going to think of A surge B now as saying A is as big as B. And for finite sets</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:25,360 –&gt; 00:03:29,520<br>we could, it’s literally true that A surge B if and only if the size of A is greater</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:29,520 –&gt; 00:03:35,240<br>than or equal to the size of B. Now let me take a moment to say that this notion of size</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:35,240 –&gt; 00:03:40,439<br>or cardinality, when you’re talking about infinite sets it’s kind of a no-no.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:40,439 –&gt; 00:03:46,439<br>There’s an abstract concept of what cardinal numbers are, what these infinite numbers are,</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:46,439 –&gt; 00:03:49,240<br>but the truth is they’re technical and not very much use.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:49,240 –&gt; 00:03:54,800<br>So we will never actually be talking about the cardinality or size of an infinite set.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:54,800 –&gt; 00:03:56,920<br>But what we will do is compare them.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:56,920 –&gt; 00:04:03,600<br>We’re going to have a nice elementary theory of the idea that the cardinality of one set</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:03,599 –&gt; 00:04:06,960<br>is greater than or equal to the cardinality of another set.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:06,960 –&gt; 00:04:10,719<br>And the basic definition is going to be based on surge.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:10,719 –&gt; 00:04:13,560<br>Similarly, bijection is even easier.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:13,560 –&gt; 00:04:18,519<br>A bij means that there’s a bijection from A to B. And we’re going to interpret that as</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:18,519 –&gt; 00:04:20,719<br>saying that A and B are the same size.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:20,719 –&gt; 00:04:25,879<br>That is, for finite sets it literally means A and B have the same number of elements.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:25,879 –&gt; 00:04:31,680<br>We’re going to adopt the notion of a bijective relation for infinite sets as meaning, okay,</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:31,680 –&gt; 00:04:35,600<br>I don’t know what their size is, but I know it’s the same because there’s a bijection</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:35,600 –&gt; 00:04:36,600<br>between them.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:36,600 –&gt; 00:04:42,400<br>There’s a perfect one-to-one correspondence between A and B’s.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:42,400 –&gt; 00:04:46,480<br>Let’s look at an example of where a bijection comes up.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:46,480 –&gt; 00:04:51,600<br>The power set of N, if N is the non-negative integers, the power set of N is all the subsets</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:51,600 –&gt; 00:04:53,319<br>of non-negative integers.</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:53,319 –&gt; 00:04:58,519<br>And let me just remark that there’s an obvious bijection between the subsets of integers</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:58,519 –&gt; 00:05:02,240<br>and the infinite bit strings, the infinite strings of zeros and ones.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:02,240 –&gt; 00:05:06,279<br>So N is the set of non-negative integers, zero, one, two.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:06,279 –&gt; 00:05:11,719<br>If you take any subset of N, here’s one with has zero, missing one, has two and three,</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:11,719 –&gt; 00:05:18,039<br>missing four, five, has six, and so on, then what I can do is represent such a subset,</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:18,039 –&gt; 00:05:23,039<br>possibly an infinite subset now, by an infinite sequence of ones and zeros, put in ones in</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:23,040 –&gt; 00:05:29,200<br>the position where elements in the subset occur and zeros in positions where elements don’t</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:29,200 –&gt; 00:05:30,200<br>occur.</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:30,200 –&gt; 00:05:39,280<br>This was exactly the same bijection that we had found between the non-negative, the bit</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:39,280 –&gt; 00:05:44,200<br>strings and the finite subsets of the non-negative integers.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:44,200 –&gt; 00:05:48,520<br>But now we’re just extending it to arbitrary subsets of the non-negative integers.</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:48,520 –&gt; 00:05:53,000<br>So this defines a bijection between any subset of integers corresponds to an infinite</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:53,000 –&gt; 00:05:58,519<br>bit strings and conversely from any infinite bit string, you can reconstruct what subset it</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:58,519 –&gt; 00:05:59,519<br>refers to.</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:59,519 –&gt; 00:06:04,879<br>So here’s this notation, zero, one, to the omega, meaning the infinite bit strings that</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:04,879 –&gt; 00:06:10,240<br>are infinite to the right, they have a beginning in comparison to zero, one superscript star,</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:10,240 –&gt; 00:06:15,800<br>which refers to the finite sets of bit strings.</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:15,800 –&gt; 00:06:22,920<br>So now let’s examine the standard size properties that you’d expect if these relationships</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:22,920 –&gt; 00:06:27,920<br>of surge and biject behaved like relationships between sizes.</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:27,920 –&gt; 00:06:33,240<br>So one basic property that finite sizes have is that if A is equal to B and B is equal</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:33,240 –&gt; 00:06:37,240<br>to C in size, then the size of A and the size of C are the same.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:37,240 –&gt; 00:06:42,560<br>And certainly true for finite sets, does it hold for infinite sets where now equality</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:42,560 –&gt; 00:06:44,480<br>is going to be replaced by biject?</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:44,480 –&gt; 00:06:46,080<br>Well, we have to check it.</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:46,079 –&gt; 00:06:52,120<br>Is it true that if A, bij, B and B, bij, C implies A, bij, C?</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:52,120 –&gt; 00:06:53,639<br>Well, how do you prove that?</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:53,639 –&gt; 00:06:56,399<br>Well, it’s true, and here’s how.</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:56,399 –&gt; 00:07:03,759<br>By definition, since A, bij, B, that means that you have a bijection, F, R, G, from A to</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:03,759 –&gt; 00:07:10,079<br>B. And since B, bij, C, you have a bijection F from B to C.</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:10,079 –&gt; 00:07:13,599<br>Now I need from these two bijections that I’m given.</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:13,600 –&gt; 00:07:16,360<br>I need to find a bijection between A and C.</p>
<p>91<br>00:07:16,360 –&gt; 00:07:17,360<br>Well, that’s easy.</p>
<p>92<br>00:07:17,360 –&gt; 00:07:23,560<br>What you do is you use G to go from A to B and then you use F to go from B to C and</p>
<p>93<br>00:07:23,560 –&gt; 00:07:27,720<br>you compose them and that gives you the needed bijection from A to C.</p>
<p>94<br>00:07:27,720 –&gt; 00:07:34,720<br>So you find H to be the composition of F and G and it’s easy to check that if G and</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:34,720 –&gt; 00:07:38,280<br>F are bijections, then their composition is a bijection.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:38,280 –&gt; 00:07:41,160<br>So that’s how I find the needed bijection from A to C.</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:41,160 –&gt; 00:07:44,040<br>So this property works out just fine.</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:44,040 –&gt; 00:07:48,920<br>The similar property applies to at least as big as greater than or equal to, for finite</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:48,920 –&gt; 00:07:52,880<br>sets, if A is greater than equal to B and B is greater than equal to C in size, then A</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:52,880 –&gt; 00:07:57,900<br>is greater than equal to C. And actually the same argument that works for biject works</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:57,900 –&gt; 00:08:03,640<br>for search because the composition of surjection, of surjective functions is a surjective function.</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:03,640 –&gt; 00:08:08,120<br>So if A, surge B and B, surge C implies A, surge C.</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:08,120 –&gt; 00:08:12,920<br>Now, again, remember, although we’re thinking of surges meaning greater than or equal to</p>
<p>104<br>00:08:12,920 –&gt; 00:08:17,079<br>in size, you cannot take these size properties for granted.</p>
<p>105<br>00:08:17,079 –&gt; 00:08:18,639<br>They have to be proved.</p>
<p>106<br>00:08:18,639 –&gt; 00:08:23,120<br>Surge has a technical definition having to do with surjective functions, functions with</p>
<p>107<br>00:08:23,120 –&gt; 00:08:30,360<br>greater equal to 1 arrow in that is not the same as talking about equality of some kind</p>
<p>108<br>00:08:30,360 –&gt; 00:08:31,360<br>of sizes.</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:31,360 –&gt; 00:08:36,799<br>Well, let’s look at an example where the size properties hold but they’re less obvious.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:36,799 –&gt; 00:08:40,759<br>Because here’s another familiar size property.</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:40,759 –&gt; 00:08:45,500<br>If A and B are each of size greater than or equal to the other one, then they have the same</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:45,500 –&gt; 00:08:46,500<br>size.</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:46,500 –&gt; 00:08:50,339<br>So if the size of A is greater than the size of B and the size of B is greater than the</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:50,339 –&gt; 00:08:53,599<br>size of A, then A and B are the same size.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:53,599 –&gt; 00:08:55,599<br>Now, this is certainly true for finite sets.</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:55,599 –&gt; 00:08:59,799<br>It’s kind of, you know, you can even think about that fact.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:59,799 –&gt; 00:09:04,439<br>And it holds for infinite sets, but it’s not so obvious.</p>
<p>118<br>00:09:04,440 –&gt; 00:09:10,120<br>So what we’re saying is that if I have a surjective function from A to B and I have another</p>
<p>119<br>00:09:10,120 –&gt; 00:09:17,000<br>surjective function from B to A, then there’s a bijection between A and B. And the problem</p>
<p>120<br>00:09:17,000 –&gt; 00:09:22,640<br>here is that this surjection from A to B might not be a bijection and this surjection</p>
<p>121<br>00:09:22,640 –&gt; 00:09:25,360<br>from B to A might also not be a bijection.</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:25,360 –&gt; 00:09:27,280<br>So where’s the bijection going to come from?</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:27,280 –&gt; 00:09:29,040<br>I have to build it.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:29,040 –&gt; 00:09:31,520<br>And so this is not an obvious property.</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:31,520 –&gt; 00:09:32,520<br>It’s true.</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:32,519 –&gt; 00:09:33,799<br>It’s a never-burned-stine theorem.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:33,799 –&gt; 00:09:39,519<br>And the trick basically is you take the bijection from A to B and the bijection from B to A</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:39,519 –&gt; 00:09:45,399<br>and you take parts of one and combine it with parts of the other and in a slightly ingenious</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:45,399 –&gt; 00:09:51,399<br>way that actually is contained in a problem in the text, you can find the bijection from</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:51,399 –&gt; 00:09:52,399<br>A to B.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:52,399 –&gt; 00:09:54,000<br>But it does take a little bit of ingenuity.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:54,000 –&gt; 00:09:59,079<br>So this is a size property that works for surge and bijection.</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:59,080 –&gt; 00:10:03,200<br>But you can’t say it’s obvious.</p>
<p>134<br>00:10:03,200 –&gt; 00:10:07,720<br>Well let’s look at an unfamiliar size property, something that’s not true of finite sets where</p>
<p>135<br>00:10:07,720 –&gt; 00:10:12,000<br>we have to start being careful and not just hand wave and use our intuition about finite</p>
<p>136<br>00:10:12,000 –&gt; 00:10:13,000<br>sets.</p>
<p>137<br>00:10:13,000 –&gt; 00:10:17,840<br>Namely, for infinite sizes, size plus one is equal to size.</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:17,840 –&gt; 00:10:19,600<br>Now what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:19,600 –&gt; 00:10:21,759<br>Well let’s just illustrate it with an example.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:21,759 –&gt; 00:10:27,440<br>In fact, in some ways you could say the definition of an infinite set is that its size plus</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:27,440 –&gt; 00:10:29,800<br>one is equal to its size.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:29,800 –&gt; 00:10:31,480<br>Let’s look at a simple example.</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:31,480 –&gt; 00:10:36,320<br>So on the bottom I have the non-negative integers and on the top I have the positive integers.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:36,320 –&gt; 00:10:40,400<br>So I can get from the positive integers to the non-negative integers just by throwing</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:40,400 –&gt; 00:10:41,400<br>in zero.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:41,400 –&gt; 00:10:43,080<br>So that’s where the plus one comes from.</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:43,080 –&gt; 00:10:44,520<br>Here’s a nice infinite set.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:44,520 –&gt; 00:10:48,400<br>I add another element to it and I get another infinite set.</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:48,400 –&gt; 00:10:50,480<br>But they are the same size.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:50,480 –&gt; 00:10:53,400<br>I have to show a bijection between them to show they’re the same size.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:53,399 –&gt; 00:10:54,959<br>So you know what the bijection is.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:54,959 –&gt; 00:10:58,720<br>Map zero to one, one to two, two to three.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:58,720 –&gt; 00:11:04,159<br>This is a bijection which you know as the add one function, the add one function maps the</p>
<p>154<br>00:11:04,159 –&gt; 00:11:08,879<br>non-negative integers to the positive integers and it’s a perfect bijection.</p>
<p>155<br>00:11:08,879 –&gt; 00:11:14,120<br>Therefore adding one element to the non-negative integers to the positive integers does not get</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:14,120 –&gt; 00:11:15,120<br>me a larger set.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:15,120 –&gt; 00:11:17,480<br>It gets me another set of the same size.</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:17,480 –&gt; 00:11:22,039<br>And this argument actually generalizes to any infinite set.</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:22,039 –&gt; 00:11:26,559<br>If you throw in one extra element you could still find a bijection between the original</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:26,559 –&gt; 00:11:30,559<br>set and the set with one extra element.</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:30,559 –&gt; 00:11:33,559<br>So and is the same size as the positive integers.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:33,559 –&gt; 00:11:37,120<br>Well, in fact let’s look at this one.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:37,120 –&gt; 00:11:42,480<br>I can enumerate on the top all the integers, both positive and negative, right?</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:42,480 –&gt; 00:11:45,399<br>Zero, one minus one, two minus two and so on.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:45,399 –&gt; 00:11:49,759<br>And that gives me the set consisting of all the integers and over here I can have zero,</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:49,759 –&gt; 00:11:52,200<br>one, two, just the non-negative integers.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:52,200 –&gt; 00:11:58,439<br>And you can see the orderly way in which I’ve listed the integers at the top, that implicitly</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:58,439 –&gt; 00:11:59,439<br>defines a bijection.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:59,439 –&gt; 00:12:06,159<br>I’m going to map zero to the zero element of the sequence above one to one, two to minus</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:06,159 –&gt; 00:12:08,639<br>one, three to two, four to minus two.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:08,639 –&gt; 00:12:15,879<br>And in this way I’ve actually defined a bijection between the non-negative integers and all</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:15,879 –&gt; 00:12:16,879<br>the integers.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:16,879 –&gt; 00:12:21,879<br>In other words, you take a half of the integers, namely the non-negative integers, and it’s</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:21,879 –&gt; 00:12:23,840<br>still the same size as all of them.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:23,840 –&gt; 00:12:27,759<br>There’s a bijection between n and z.</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:27,759 –&gt; 00:12:32,919<br>Now you could write a formula actually if you were trying to figure out what does the</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:32,919 –&gt; 00:12:36,799<br>number n go to, what positive or negative integers.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:36,799 –&gt; 00:12:41,759<br>There’s some not very hard formula involving dividing n by two and rounding.</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:41,759 –&gt; 00:12:42,759<br>But that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:42,759 –&gt; 00:12:49,439<br>Once I’ve figured out some sensible way to list all the elements of the integers in a row,</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:49,439 –&gt; 00:12:52,480<br>then I can line them up against the non-negative integers.</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:52,480 –&gt; 00:12:57,960<br>And that listing in effect defines the mapping in a perfectly clear way without necessarily</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:57,960 –&gt; 00:12:58,960<br>having a formula.</p>
