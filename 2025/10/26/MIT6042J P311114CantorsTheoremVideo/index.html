                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,839<br>So it’s time to examine uncountable sets.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,839 –&gt; 00:00:15,120<br>And that’s what we’re going to do in this segment.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:15,120 –&gt; 00:00:19,559<br>So Cantor’s question was, are all sets the same size?</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,559 –&gt; 00:00:23,719<br>And he gives a definitive answer of no.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,719 –&gt; 00:00:29,839<br>Cantor’s theorem, which we’re about to present, will show that in fact, there isn’t any</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,839 –&gt; 00:00:31,120<br>biggest infinity.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:31,120 –&gt; 00:00:36,159<br>For any given infinity, you can find a bigger one in a very simple way.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:36,159 –&gt; 00:00:44,000<br>But let’s begin by coming up with the simplest form of Cantor’s diagonal argument.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:44,000 –&gt; 00:00:47,519<br>Of how do you prove that a set is not countable?</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:47,519 –&gt; 00:00:51,960<br>Well, remember, a set is countable if you can list it possibly with repeats.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:51,960 –&gt; 00:00:57,100<br>So A is countable if there’s a sequence A0, A1, A2, such that every element in the set A</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:57,100 –&gt; 00:01:01,820<br>shows up at some time or other in the list, possibly more than once, and the only things</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:01,820 –&gt; 00:01:08,659<br>in the list are elements of A. And we saw as an example that the finite bit strings,</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:08,659 –&gt; 00:01:14,340<br>the finite strings of zeros and ones, or the finite binary words, are an example of a countable</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:14,340 –&gt; 00:01:15,340<br>set.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,340 –&gt; 00:01:19,780<br>And I’d be claim last time in an hour about to prove that the difference is that if you</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:19,780 –&gt; 00:01:24,500<br>look at the infinite bit strings, the one-way infinite, they have a beginning and they go</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:24,500 –&gt; 00:01:30,260<br>on infinitely to the right, the notation being 0, 1 to the omega, where omega is an indication</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:30,260 –&gt; 00:01:33,340<br>of one of the symbols for it in the kind of infinity.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:33,340 –&gt; 00:01:37,099<br>And this is going to be an example of an uncountable set.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:37,099 –&gt; 00:01:39,060<br>How are we going to prove that?</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:39,060 –&gt; 00:01:45,900<br>Well, the set up for using a diagonal argument is to think about drawing a matrix.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:45,900 –&gt; 00:01:54,460<br>Suppose that I have some way of enumerating the infinite binary sequences in 0, 1 to</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:54,459 –&gt; 00:01:55,459<br>the omega.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:55,459 –&gt; 00:02:00,379<br>So there’s a sequence s0, there’s a sequence s1, there’s a sequence s2, let’s lay them</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:00,379 –&gt; 00:02:04,099<br>out, let’s know they were the rows of a matrix.</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:04,099 –&gt; 00:02:10,620<br>So s0 is this infinite binary sequence, 0, 0, 1, 0, and so on.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:10,620 –&gt; 00:02:14,979<br>And the column labels are simply the coordinate labels for s0.</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:14,979 –&gt; 00:02:18,740<br>So this is s0, 0, s0, 1, and so on.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:18,740 –&gt; 00:02:26,420<br>s1 is the next infinite binary sequence in this hypothetical list, and it starts 0, 1,</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:26,420 –&gt; 00:02:29,780<br>1, 0, and goes on, and so on down the line.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:29,780 –&gt; 00:02:37,820<br>So the row labels are this enumeration of binary sequences, and the column labels are</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:37,820 –&gt; 00:02:38,820<br>coordinate labels.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:38,820 –&gt; 00:02:43,140<br>And this is a matrix that’s infinite to the right and infinite down, but it definitely</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:43,140 –&gt; 00:02:46,020<br>has an upper left corner.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:46,020 –&gt; 00:02:54,460<br>So the trick is to try to find an infinite binary sequence that is not in this list, that</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:54,460 –&gt; 00:02:56,860<br>it differs from every row.</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:56,860 –&gt; 00:03:03,420<br>If I can do that, then I’ve shown that any attempt to enumerate all of the binary sequences</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:03,420 –&gt; 00:03:09,780<br>in 0, 1 to the omega, any sequence like s0, s1, s2 of binary sequences is missing something,</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:09,780 –&gt; 00:03:11,980<br>which means you can’t really list it.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:11,980 –&gt; 00:03:14,260<br>Well how do you find something that’s missing?</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:14,260 –&gt; 00:03:15,580<br>How do you find a sequence that’s not here?</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:15,580 –&gt; 00:03:17,260<br>Well it’s pretty easy.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:17,260 –&gt; 00:03:19,660<br>You look at the first digit, and that was a 0.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:19,660 –&gt; 00:03:24,500<br>So you choose the first digit of the new sequence to be 1, the opposite of 0.</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:24,500 –&gt; 00:03:33,740<br>You choose the second digit to be the opposite of the coordinate of s, a 1 of s1, and compliment</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:33,740 –&gt; 00:03:34,740<br>that.</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:34,740 –&gt; 00:03:40,020<br>Now here the digit 2 of s2 is a 0, so let’s make that a 1, and the next one on the diagonal</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:40,020 –&gt; 00:03:45,540<br>is a 0, and so on we’re going to compliment all of the bits along this diagonal.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:45,539 –&gt; 00:03:50,340<br>So I get a diagonal sequence, that’s why this argument is called a diagonal argument.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:50,340 –&gt; 00:03:54,819<br>Well let’s think about this diagonal sequence, it just goes on, right down the diagonal of</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:54,819 –&gt; 00:03:57,219<br>this 2-dimensional infinite matrix.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:57,219 –&gt; 00:04:01,780<br>What we can say about it is that it differs from every row.</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:01,780 –&gt; 00:04:02,780<br>Why is that?</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:02,780 –&gt; 00:04:06,299<br>Well it differs from the 15th row with the 15th position, or coordinate 15.</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:06,299 –&gt; 00:04:09,819<br>It differs from the 99th row at coordinate 99.</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:09,819 –&gt; 00:04:13,939<br>It’s not in the matrix, it’s not a row of any matrix.</p>
<p>58<br>00:04:13,939 –&gt; 00:04:19,980<br>And that immediately tells you it’s over any attempt to list all of the elements in 0,</p>
<p>59<br>00:04:19,980 –&gt; 00:04:26,060<br>1 to the omega, is going to omit a diagonal element, it’s not possible to list all of them,</p>
<p>60<br>00:04:26,060 –&gt; 00:04:28,660<br>in other words.</p>
<p>61<br>00:04:28,660 –&gt; 00:04:34,620<br>There isn’t any surjection from the non-negative integers to 0, 1 to the omega, because</p>
<p>62<br>00:04:34,620 –&gt; 00:04:43,899<br>I’ve just shown you how if you give me a surjection of binary sequences, in effect I’m giving</p>
<p>63<br>00:04:43,979 –&gt; 00:04:49,699<br>you with n, a 0 sequence, a 1 sequence, a 3rd second sequence, and so on, then I know exactly</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:49,699 –&gt; 00:04:51,099<br>how to find something that’s not there.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:51,099 –&gt; 00:04:57,219<br>There can’t be a surjection from n to the 0, 1 to the omega, it’s just not true.</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:57,219 –&gt; 00:05:01,699<br>And that’s why we can say that 0, 1 to the omega is unaccountable.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:01,699 –&gt; 00:05:05,139<br>Definition of countable, or an equivalent formulation of countable, remember is that there’s</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:05,139 –&gt; 00:05:07,579<br>a surjection from the non-negative integers to the set.</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:07,579 –&gt; 00:05:09,779<br>Well there isn’t any, we just proved it.</p>
<p>70<br>00:05:09,779 –&gt; 00:05:17,379<br>So n is not surge 0, 1, by the way, it’s also quite easy to say that there is a surjection</p>
<p>71<br>00:05:17,379 –&gt; 00:05:21,339<br>from the infinite binary sequence to the non-negative integers.</p>
<p>72<br>00:05:21,339 –&gt; 00:05:29,579<br>You could map a binary sequence to the coordinate of the first one in it, and that maps every</p>
<p>73<br>00:05:29,579 –&gt; 00:05:34,299<br>infinite binary sequence to a non-negative integer, it hits every non-negative integer,</p>
<p>74<br>00:05:34,300 –&gt; 00:05:35,300<br>lots of times.</p>
<p>75<br>00:05:35,300 –&gt; 00:05:40,139<br>I hit 5 with a sequence that starts with 4, 0, and 1.</p>
<p>76<br>00:05:40,139 –&gt; 00:05:44,100<br>The only sequence that doesn’t go anywhere is the all 0 sequence, but by the way, if you</p>
<p>77<br>00:05:44,100 –&gt; 00:05:48,500<br>check the definition of surge, it doesn’t require that the function be total.</p>
<p>78<br>00:05:48,500 –&gt; 00:05:56,180<br>Surge means that there is a function that is a surjection to n, but there doesn’t have</p>
<p>79<br>00:05:56,180 –&gt; 00:06:00,900<br>to be greater than or equal 1 arrow out, there just has to be less than or equal to 1 arrow,</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:00,900 –&gt; 00:06:01,900<br>so it’s a function.</p>
<p>81<br>00:06:01,899 –&gt; 00:06:03,899<br>But of course, it’s easy enough to make it total.</p>
<p>82<br>00:06:03,899 –&gt; 00:06:06,699<br>The all 0 sequence just maps it to 0.</p>
<p>83<br>00:06:06,699 –&gt; 00:06:13,699<br>So now you have both 0 and the sequence that starts with any sequence that starts with</p>
<p>84<br>00:06:13,699 –&gt; 00:06:15,699<br>1 will all map to 0.</p>
<p>85<br>00:06:15,699 –&gt; 00:06:23,339<br>Okay, so if we remember our intuition, the surge is read as greater than or equal to, so</p>
<p>86<br>00:06:23,339 –&gt; 00:06:28,579<br>this tells us that the infinite binary sequences are a larger set, at least as larger set as</p>
<p>87<br>00:06:28,579 –&gt; 00:06:32,539<br>the non-negative integers, and the converse is true, the non-negative integers are not</p>
<p>88<br>00:06:32,539 –&gt; 00:06:38,259<br>at least as large as the infinite binary sequences, so we can really say that the non-negative</p>
<p>89<br>00:06:38,259 –&gt; 00:06:43,579<br>integers are strictly smaller than the set of infinite binary sequences.</p>
<p>90<br>00:06:43,579 –&gt; 00:06:49,539<br>Now, strictly smaller is in quotes, because again, we don’t know exactly what the size</p>
<p>91<br>00:06:49,539 –&gt; 00:06:51,659<br>of infinite sets is.</p>
<p>92<br>00:06:51,659 –&gt; 00:06:57,379<br>All we’re doing really are talking about properties of objections, bijection surge,</p>
<p>93<br>00:06:57,379 –&gt; 00:06:58,379<br>objections, injections.</p>
<p>94<br>00:06:58,379 –&gt; 00:07:02,180<br>Okay, so let’s make an explicit definition.</p>
<p>95<br>00:07:02,180 –&gt; 00:07:08,620<br>I’m going to say that a strict b means that there is no surgection from a to b.</p>
<p>96<br>00:07:08,620 –&gt; 00:07:14,300<br>So if we read a surgection b intuitively as a greater than or equal to b, this is saying</p>
<p>97<br>00:07:14,300 –&gt; 00:07:19,500<br>it’s not true that a is greater than or equal to b, or in ordinary language and thinking</p>
<p>98<br>00:07:19,500 –&gt; 00:07:23,860<br>about sets, if it’s not true that you’re greater than or equal to b, you must be strictly</p>
<p>99<br>00:07:23,860 –&gt; 00:07:25,259<br>less than b.</p>
<p>100<br>00:07:25,259 –&gt; 00:07:27,579<br>So that’s the motivation for the word strict.</p>
<p>101<br>00:07:27,579 –&gt; 00:07:32,180<br>But remember, we’re talking about infinite sets, and we can’t go around assuming too many</p>
<p>102<br>00:07:32,180 –&gt; 00:07:35,019<br>properties of strict until we’ve proved them.</p>
<p>103<br>00:07:35,019 –&gt; 00:07:39,740<br>One non-trivial property, by the way, is I’m defined strict that it’s not true that there’s</p>
<p>104<br>00:07:39,740 –&gt; 00:07:47,300<br>a surgection from a to b, but I’m not insisting that there must be a surgection from b to a,</p>
<p>105<br>00:07:47,300 –&gt; 00:07:51,300<br>which would be the second companion part, that is a is not greater than or equal to b,</p>
<p>106<br>00:07:51,300 –&gt; 00:07:53,379<br>and b is greater than or equal to a.</p>
<p>107<br>00:07:53,379 –&gt; 00:07:58,060<br>It turns out, technically, you can prove that if there isn’t any surgection from a to</p>
<p>108<br>00:07:58,060 –&gt; 00:08:02,819<br>b, there will be a surgection from b to a, but that’s using a set theoretic argument that’s</p>
<p>109<br>00:08:02,819 –&gt; 00:08:04,779<br>not so obvious, and we don’t need it.</p>
<p>110<br>00:08:04,779 –&gt; 00:08:09,899<br>So this is the definition of strict a, strict b means you cannot get a surgection from a</p>
<p>111<br>00:08:09,899 –&gt; 00:08:15,420<br>to b, and we’re intuitively reading it as a is strictly small within b.</p>
<p>112<br>00:08:15,420 –&gt; 00:08:21,620<br>And what we’ve just shown then is that the non-negative integers strict 0, 1 to the</p>
<p>113<br>00:08:21,620 –&gt; 00:08:24,180<br>omega, the infinite binary sequences.</p>
<p>114<br>00:08:24,180 –&gt; 00:08:29,139<br>Okay, now, cantist theorem is a wonderful generalization of this.</p>
<p>115<br>00:08:29,139 –&gt; 00:08:33,460<br>It’s a powerful generalization, but the proof is pretty much the same, although it sometimes</p>
<p>116<br>00:08:33,460 –&gt; 00:08:35,740<br>looks a little different as it’s written up.</p>
<p>117<br>00:08:35,740 –&gt; 00:08:40,100<br>And what cantist theorem says is just beautifully elegant and simple.</p>
<p>118<br>00:08:40,100 –&gt; 00:08:44,820<br>It says simply that the power set is strictly bigger than the set.</p>
<p>119<br>00:08:44,820 –&gt; 00:08:50,580<br>A strict power set of a, for every set a, even if a is finite, because remember if a is</p>
<p>120<br>00:08:50,580 –&gt; 00:08:56,400<br>finite, say a has n elements, then the power set of a has 2 to the n elements, and you</p>
<p>121<br>00:08:56,400 –&gt; 00:09:02,740<br>can check that even for a equals 0, n is less than or equal to 2 to the n is less than 2</p>
<p>122<br>00:09:02,740 –&gt; 00:09:03,740<br>to the n.</p>
<p>123<br>00:09:03,740 –&gt; 00:09:13,020<br>0 is less than 2 to the 0, which is 1, 2 is less than 2 squared, which is 4 and so on.</p>
<p>124<br>00:09:13,020 –&gt; 00:09:17,900<br>So even for finite sets, we have a strict power set of a, but the cool thing is that it works</p>
<p>125<br>00:09:17,900 –&gt; 00:09:20,340<br>even for infinite sets.</p>
<p>126<br>00:09:20,340 –&gt; 00:09:21,340<br>Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>127<br>00:09:21,340 –&gt; 00:09:25,899<br>It’s a diagonal argument again, but now I mustn’t assume that a is countable.</p>
<p>128<br>00:09:25,899 –&gt; 00:09:29,500<br>I’m not going to assume that I can really list the elements of a, but we’ll think about</p>
<p>129<br>00:09:29,500 –&gt; 00:09:30,660<br>it as though we could.</p>
<p>130<br>00:09:30,660 –&gt; 00:09:32,700<br>Let’s think about this matrix again.</p>
<p>131<br>00:09:32,700 –&gt; 00:09:36,460<br>So suppose a is this set of elements, a, b, st, d, e.</p>
<p>132<br>00:09:36,460 –&gt; 00:09:41,379<br>I’m scrambling up the alphabet on purpose because I don’t want you to get the idea that</p>
<p>133<br>00:09:41,379 –&gt; 00:09:45,019<br>we’re assuming that a is countable, that you can list all the elements of a.</p>
<p>134<br>00:09:45,019 –&gt; 00:09:49,980<br>I’m not assuming that, but I’m just writing out a sample of elements of a.</p>
<p>135<br>00:09:49,980 –&gt; 00:09:55,019<br>And let’s suppose that I was trying to get a surjection from a to the power set of</p>
<p>136<br>00:09:55,019 –&gt; 00:09:56,019<br>a.</p>
<p>137<br>00:09:56,019 –&gt; 00:10:02,580<br>So suppose I have a function f that maps each of the successive elements of a to some subset</p>
<p>138<br>00:10:02,580 –&gt; 00:10:03,580<br>of a.</p>
<p>139<br>00:10:03,580 –&gt; 00:10:05,940<br>So f of a is part of the power set.</p>
<p>140<br>00:10:05,940 –&gt; 00:10:11,220<br>It’s a subset of capital A, f of b is a subset of capital A, and so on.</p>
<p>141<br>00:10:11,220 –&gt; 00:10:12,860<br>And suppose I had a set up like this.</p>
<p>142<br>00:10:12,860 –&gt; 00:10:17,300<br>I’m going to draw a matrix that looks like the diagonal matrix, and we’re going to extract</p>
<p>143<br>00:10:17,299 –&gt; 00:10:23,899<br>the diagonal set and discover that that diagonal set is not one of the f’s.</p>
<p>144<br>00:10:23,899 –&gt; 00:10:27,859<br>It’s not f of anything, which means that f is not going to be a surjection.</p>
<p>145<br>00:10:27,859 –&gt; 00:10:29,019<br>So let’s look at it again.</p>
<p>146<br>00:10:29,019 –&gt; 00:10:33,939<br>So here’s this matrix where I’m labeling the columns of the matrix by the elements of</p>
<p>147<br>00:10:33,939 –&gt; 00:10:35,740<br>a.</p>
<p>148<br>00:10:35,740 –&gt; 00:10:38,939<br>No particular order here, but I, in order to draw a matrix, I have to write them down in</p>
<p>149<br>00:10:38,939 –&gt; 00:10:40,019<br>some order.</p>
<p>150<br>00:10:40,019 –&gt; 00:10:44,379<br>And likewise, the first row is going to be f of this element a.</p>
<p>151<br>00:10:44,379 –&gt; 00:10:46,019<br>Well, what is an f of a?</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:46,019 –&gt; 00:10:48,100<br>f of a is going to be a set of elements.</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:48,100 –&gt; 00:10:53,899<br>So let’s just write the elements in f of a down under the corresponding column label.</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:53,899 –&gt; 00:10:59,740<br>So here’s an example where f of a, it has an a in it, and no b, but it has an s in it,</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:59,740 –&gt; 00:11:03,700<br>and a t in it, no c, no d, it has an e.</p>
<p>156<br>00:11:03,700 –&gt; 00:11:07,779<br>Likewise, f of b has an a in a b, and no s or t, but it’s got a c.</p>
<p>157<br>00:11:07,779 –&gt; 00:11:13,299<br>And so I filled in this matrix by taking f of an element in a, which is supposed to</p>
<p>158<br>00:11:13,299 –&gt; 00:11:22,899<br>be a subset of a, and writing out all of the elements in that subset under the corresponding</p>
<p>159<br>00:11:22,899 –&gt; 00:11:28,059<br>letter, or a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, corresponding element of the subset.</p>
<p>160<br>00:11:28,059 –&gt; 00:11:33,339<br>So b goes under b, if it’s in f of c, and s goes under an s, if it’s in f of c, nothing</p>
<p>161<br>00:11:33,339 –&gt; 00:11:36,459<br>goes under a t, if t is not in f of c.</p>
<p>162<br>00:11:36,459 –&gt; 00:11:37,459<br>That’s what we’re seeing here.</p>
<p>163<br>00:11:37,459 –&gt; 00:11:41,779<br>So I’m laying out, as though I was using zeros and ones for an infinite binary sequence,</p>
<p>164<br>00:11:41,779 –&gt; 00:11:48,819<br>I’m laying out each of the sets that are in the range of f along this row.</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:48,819 –&gt; 00:11:54,860<br>And now with this setup, I can define a new set, which is not going to be an f.</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:54,860 –&gt; 00:11:55,860<br>How do I get that?</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:55,860 –&gt; 00:12:02,339<br>Well, what I’m going to do is not in my new set, I’m not going to have any of the elements</p>
<p>168<br>00:12:02,339 –&gt; 00:12:03,980<br>that appear on the diagonal.</p>
<p>169<br>00:12:03,980 –&gt; 00:12:09,259<br>So if a is a member of f of a, that means that a appears in this coordinate, it’s not</p>
<p>170<br>00:12:09,259 –&gt; 00:12:10,899<br>going to be in my set.</p>
<p>171<br>00:12:10,899 –&gt; 00:12:16,860<br>If b is in f of b, meaning that b appears in, that b appears in the f of b row under the</p>
<p>172<br>00:12:16,860 –&gt; 00:12:20,100<br>column b, it’s not going to be in my set.</p>
<p>173<br>00:12:20,100 –&gt; 00:12:25,500<br>On the other hand, s is not in f of s, because there’s no s there.</p>
<p>174<br>00:12:25,500 –&gt; 00:12:28,659<br>So I’m going to put an s there in magenta.</p>
<p>175<br>00:12:28,659 –&gt; 00:12:34,220<br>And likewise, I’m going to stick elements in or out the opposite of whether they appear</p>
<p>176<br>00:12:34,220 –&gt; 00:12:35,539<br>on the diagonal.</p>
<p>177<br>00:12:35,539 –&gt; 00:12:43,299<br>And this is going to give me a set d, which is going to be my diagonal set.</p>
<p>178<br>00:12:43,299 –&gt; 00:12:49,219<br>So if we write this out, what we’re saying is suppose that I have a function f from a</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:49,219 –&gt; 00:12:56,379<br>to the power set of a, then what I’m going to do is define a subset of a that’s not in</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:56,379 –&gt; 00:13:05,500<br>the range of f, namely set d, which is the set of those elements in a such that little</p>
<p>181<br>00:13:05,500 –&gt; 00:13:08,419<br>a is not in f of a.</p>
<p>182<br>00:13:08,419 –&gt; 00:13:17,940<br>Namely, if an element appeared on the diagonal, because an element with column label a was</p>
<p>183<br>00:13:17,940 –&gt; 00:13:23,019<br>in the row f of a, then I left it out of my set.</p>
<p>184<br>00:13:23,019 –&gt; 00:13:29,100<br>And if it was not in that location in the matrix, I put it in my set.</p>
<p>185<br>00:13:29,100 –&gt; 00:13:33,740<br>So I’m keeping all the elements that aren’t in on the diagonal.</p>
<p>186<br>00:13:33,740 –&gt; 00:13:35,659<br>That’s my diagonal set d.</p>
<p>187<br>00:13:35,659 –&gt; 00:13:40,860<br>And what I know about it is that d is not in the range of f, because it differs from every</p>
<p>188<br>00:13:40,860 –&gt; 00:13:44,700<br>possible row of the matrix.</p>
<p>189<br>00:13:44,700 –&gt; 00:13:53,659<br>If the row is labeled with f of a, as f of a, then it differs in the column a f of a from</p>
<p>190<br>00:13:53,659 –&gt; 00:13:55,060<br>that row.</p>
<p>191<br>00:13:55,060 –&gt; 00:14:01,220<br>And therefore, my set d is not a row of this matrix.</p>
<p>192<br>00:14:01,220 –&gt; 00:14:04,899<br>And that means that it’s not equal to f of anything.</p>
<p>193<br>00:14:04,899 –&gt; 00:14:08,700<br>So I’ve just found that there’s no f arrow into d.</p>
<p>194<br>00:14:08,700 –&gt; 00:14:10,379<br>These not in the range of f.</p>
<p>195<br>00:14:10,379 –&gt; 00:14:16,139<br>That means that if I had such an f from a to the power set of a, it’s not a projection</p>
<p>196<br>00:14:16,139 –&gt; 00:14:18,180<br>because d is always left out.</p>
<p>197<br>00:14:18,180 –&gt; 00:14:19,899<br>So f is not a projection.</p>
<p>198<br>00:14:19,899 –&gt; 00:14:26,139<br>And since f is any function from a to the power set of a, none of them are projections.</p>
<p>199<br>00:14:26,139 –&gt; 00:14:29,580<br>That means there’s no projection from a to the power set of a.</p>
<p>200<br>00:14:29,580 –&gt; 00:14:32,820<br>In other words, a strict power set of a.</p>
<p>201<br>00:14:32,820 –&gt; 00:14:35,259<br>There’s no projection.</p>
<p>202<br>00:14:35,259 –&gt; 00:14:43,139<br>Now a special case of this, of course, is that the non-negative integers are a strictly</p>
<p>203<br>00:14:43,139 –&gt; 00:14:44,900<br>smaller than the power set of a.</p>
<p>204<br>00:14:44,900 –&gt; 00:14:51,980<br>That’s an instance of can’t just theorem, we’re applying a being the set of non-negative</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:51,980 –&gt; 00:14:52,980<br>integers.</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:52,980 –&gt; 00:14:56,820<br>So there’s no projection from the non-negative integers to the subsets of non-negative</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:56,820 –&gt; 00:14:57,820<br>integers.</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:57,820 –&gt; 00:15:03,820<br>Again, that means that the power set of n is an example of an uncountable set because</p>
<p>209<br>00:15:03,820 –&gt; 00:15:08,420<br>the definition of countable is that there wouldn’t be a projection from n to power set of</p>
<p>210<br>00:15:08,420 –&gt; 00:15:09,420<br>n.</p>
<p>211<br>00:15:09,420 –&gt; 00:15:10,420<br>We’re saying there isn’t any.</p>
<p>212<br>00:15:10,420 –&gt; 00:15:14,580<br>So it’s not countable or not countable as usually phrased as uncountable.</p>
<p>213<br>00:15:14,580 –&gt; 00:15:20,860<br>So the power set of n is maybe our second example of an uncountable set, the first one being</p>
<p>214<br>00:15:20,860 –&gt; 00:15:24,020<br>the infinite sequences of binary numbers.</p>
<p>215<br>00:15:24,019 –&gt; 00:15:31,139<br>As a matter of fact, just as we had a general way to prove countability, you can show that</p>
<p>216<br>00:15:31,139 –&gt; 00:15:36,019<br>a set is countable if there’s a surjection from a set you know is countable onto the target</p>
<p>217<br>00:15:36,019 –&gt; 00:15:37,699<br>than the target’s countable.</p>
<p>218<br>00:15:37,699 –&gt; 00:15:43,500<br>Take the contrapositive of that lemma and you can say that if a set a is uncountable</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:43,500 –&gt; 00:15:48,899<br>and there’s a surjection from c to a, then c has to be uncountable.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:48,899 –&gt; 00:15:51,019<br>That’s just the contrapositive of the previous one.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:51,019 –&gt; 00:15:52,939<br>If c was countable, then a would be countable.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:52,939 –&gt; 00:15:55,980<br>So if a is uncountable, c must be uncountable.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:55,980 –&gt; 00:16:00,019<br>So this gives us again a nice general way to prove uncountability of sets once I have</p>
<p>224<br>00:16:00,019 –&gt; 00:16:02,620<br>a couple in my repertoire.</p>
<p>225<br>00:16:02,620 –&gt; 00:16:07,939<br>Well, it means that we could have deduced that a zero one to the omega that the infinite</p>
<p>226<br>00:16:07,939 –&gt; 00:16:13,500<br>binary sequences were uncountable because we know that there’s a bijection between the</p>
<p>227<br>00:16:13,500 –&gt; 00:16:15,860<br>infinite binary sequences and the power set of n.</p>
<p>228<br>00:16:15,860 –&gt; 00:16:20,299<br>We describe that bijection without knowing anything about any other properties of the</p>
<p>229<br>00:16:20,299 –&gt; 00:16:24,179<br>infinite binary sequences in the power set of n, whether they were countable or not.</p>
<p>230<br>00:16:24,179 –&gt; 00:16:28,459<br>But now that canter’s theorem tells us that the power set of n is uncountable and there’s</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:28,459 –&gt; 00:16:33,899<br>a bijection, the previous lemma says in particular there’s a surjection from zero one to the</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:33,899 –&gt; 00:16:38,979<br>omega to the power set of n, which means zero one to the omega is uncountable.</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:38,979 –&gt; 00:16:44,819<br>So what I’m illustrating then is that the proof that we use directly on by a diagonal</p>
<p>234<br>00:16:44,820 –&gt; 00:16:50,300<br>argument to figure out that zero one to the omega was uncountable.</p>
<p>235<br>00:16:50,300 –&gt; 00:16:55,540<br>It’s really a special case of the more general diagonal argument that we use to prove canter’s</p>
<p>236<br>00:16:55,540 –&gt; 00:16:56,540<br>theorem.</p>
<p>237<br>00:16:56,540 –&gt; 00:17:00,900<br>And we get that zero one to the omega is uncountable as a consequence of canter’s theorem</p>
<p>238<br>00:17:00,900 –&gt; 00:17:03,780<br>about the power set of n.</p>
<p>239<br>00:17:03,780 –&gt; 00:17:09,539<br>And so we’ve got two different ways then to prove that the infinite binary sequences are</p>
<p>240<br>00:17:09,539 –&gt; 00:17:12,380<br>uncountable.</p>
<p>241<br>00:17:12,380 –&gt; 00:17:15,380<br>Another example of uncountable set is the real numbers.</p>
<p>242<br>00:17:15,380 –&gt; 00:17:19,460<br>And Nerocute example, remember we saw that the rational numbers were countable.</p>
<p>243<br>00:17:19,460 –&gt; 00:17:20,620<br>The real numbers are uncountable.</p>
<p>244<br>00:17:20,620 –&gt; 00:17:21,940<br>Well, how do I prove that?</p>
<p>245<br>00:17:21,940 –&gt; 00:17:26,020<br>I’m just going to show you a surjection from the real numbers onto the infinite binary</p>
<p>246<br>00:17:26,020 –&gt; 00:17:27,020<br>sequences.</p>
<p>247<br>00:17:27,020 –&gt; 00:17:28,540<br>How am I going to do that?</p>
<p>248<br>00:17:28,540 –&gt; 00:17:32,180<br>Well, it’s kind of stupid trick, but it works.</p>
<p>249<br>00:17:32,180 –&gt; 00:17:34,900<br>I’m using both positive and negative reals.</p>
<p>250<br>00:17:34,900 –&gt; 00:17:39,220<br>So let’s look at some real number and look at its binary representation.</p>
<p>251<br>00:17:39,220 –&gt; 00:17:44,100<br>Assume for the moment that it’s positive.</p>
<p>252<br>00:17:44,100 –&gt; 00:17:48,579<br>So let’s look at, say, the binary representation of some number like three and a third.</p>
<p>253<br>00:17:48,579 –&gt; 00:17:53,420<br>So that means that if we’re thinking of these as binary places, this is the zeroth place,</p>
<p>254<br>00:17:53,420 –&gt; 00:17:57,299<br>the twoth place, the fourth place, this is the half place, the quarters place, the eighths</p>
<p>255<br>00:17:57,299 –&gt; 00:18:03,140<br>place, then the binary representation of three and a third would be three.</p>
<p>256<br>00:18:03,140 –&gt; 00:18:11,420<br>And then this infinite repeating not decimal, but by the, but bicepal, or binary expansion,</p>
<p>257<br>00:18:11,420 –&gt; 00:18:13,020<br>zero one, zero one, zero one.</p>
<p>258<br>00:18:13,020 –&gt; 00:18:17,460<br>And we will examine how I know that that’s a third, but take it for granted that that’s</p>
<p>259<br>00:18:17,460 –&gt; 00:18:19,220<br>what you get is the repeated fraction.</p>
<p>260<br>00:18:19,220 –&gt; 00:18:24,100<br>You could figure that out by just doing a division of one by three in binary.</p>
<p>261<br>00:18:24,100 –&gt; 00:18:30,900<br>Anyway, there is just as there’s a decimal expansion of every real number, there’s a</p>
<p>262<br>00:18:30,900 –&gt; 00:18:33,300<br>binary expansion just using base two.</p>
<p>263<br>00:18:33,300 –&gt; 00:18:35,940<br>So here’s the binary expansion of three and a third.</p>
<p>264<br>00:18:35,940 –&gt; 00:18:39,580<br>So what I’m going to do is I’m going to map three and a third to this binary sequence.</p>
<p>265<br>00:18:39,580 –&gt; 00:18:41,740<br>I’m going to ignore the decimal place of binary.</p>
<p>266<br>00:18:41,740 –&gt; 00:18:42,740<br>It’s not a decimal place.</p>
<p>267<br>00:18:42,740 –&gt; 00:18:46,100<br>It’s a decimal place or binary position.</p>
<p>268<br>00:18:46,100 –&gt; 00:18:50,380<br>And I’m just going to take this to the mapping, the sequence one, one, zero one, zero one,</p>
<p>269<br>00:18:50,380 –&gt; 00:18:51,380<br>zero one.</p>
<p>270<br>00:18:51,380 –&gt; 00:18:53,580<br>Okay.</p>
<p>271<br>00:18:53,580 –&gt; 00:18:59,340<br>And I claim that this is a suggestion because you’re going to hit every possible binary</p>
<p>272<br>00:18:59,340 –&gt; 00:19:00,820<br>sequence in this way.</p>
<p>273<br>00:19:00,819 –&gt; 00:19:02,659<br>Well, almost.</p>
<p>274<br>00:19:02,659 –&gt; 00:19:07,339<br>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p>275<br>00:19:07,339 –&gt; 00:19:15,659<br>There’s a problem with mapping to things that start with zero because let’s examine that</p>
<p>276<br>00:19:15,659 –&gt; 00:19:18,899<br>a half is 0.10000.</p>
<p>277<br>00:19:18,899 –&gt; 00:19:24,139<br>So I would map it to that.</p>
<p>278<br>00:19:24,139 –&gt; 00:19:30,339<br>But there’s an ambiguity because a half is also equal to 0.01111111.</p>
<p>279<br>00:19:30,339 –&gt; 00:19:38,779<br>And as 0.999 is equal to 1.0000 in decimal, you get the same infinite carry issue here</p>
<p>280<br>00:19:38,779 –&gt; 00:19:39,939<br>in binary.</p>
<p>281<br>00:19:39,939 –&gt; 00:19:47,579<br>So numbers that end in all ones have another way to represent the very same number by a</p>
<p>282<br>00:19:47,579 –&gt; 00:19:49,939<br>sequence that ends in all zeros.</p>
<p>283<br>00:19:49,939 –&gt; 00:19:54,220<br>So how am I going to hit if I’m using a behalf to hit this one, what’s left to hit that</p>
<p>284<br>00:19:54,220 –&gt; 00:19:55,220<br>one?</p>
<p>285<br>00:19:55,220 –&gt; 00:19:56,579<br>Oh, how about using minus a half?</p>
<p>286<br>00:19:56,579 –&gt; 00:19:58,659<br>It’s there and that’s part of R.</p>
<p>287<br>00:19:58,660 –&gt; 00:20:04,340<br>So I’m just going to map the negative numbers to the version of the expansion that starts</p>
<p>288<br>00:20:04,340 –&gt; 00:20:07,180<br>with zero and has an infinite number of ones.</p>
<p>289<br>00:20:07,180 –&gt; 00:20:11,340<br>And the positive one that ends with an infinite number of zeros.</p>
<p>290<br>00:20:11,340 –&gt; 00:20:15,140<br>And otherwise, I’m going to map plus and minus numbers to the same place.</p>
<p>291<br>00:20:15,140 –&gt; 00:20:21,220<br>So this is going to give me the needed surjection from R to the infinite binary sequences.</p>
<p>292<br>00:20:21,220 –&gt; 00:20:26,180<br>And by our previous lemma, that implies sure enough that the real numbers are uncountable.</p>
