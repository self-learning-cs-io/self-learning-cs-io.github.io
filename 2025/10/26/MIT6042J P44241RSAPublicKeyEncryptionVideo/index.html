                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:05,879<br>The RSA crypto system is one of the lovely and really important applications of</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:05,879 –&gt; 00:00:12,759<br>number theory in computer science. So let’s start talking about it. The RSA</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:12,759 –&gt; 00:00:17,100<br>crypto system is what is known as a public key crypto system which has the</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:17,100 –&gt; 00:00:24,580<br>following really amazing properties. Namely, anyone can send a secret</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:24,579 –&gt; 00:00:30,739<br>encrypted message to a designated receiver. This is without there being any</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:30,739 –&gt; 00:00:37,299<br>prior contact using only publicly available information. Now if you think about</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:37,299 –&gt; 00:00:41,140<br>that it’s really terrific because it means that you can send a secret message</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:41,140 –&gt; 00:00:46,619<br>to Amazon that nobody but Amazon can read even though the entire world knows</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:46,619 –&gt; 00:00:51,259<br>what you know and can see what you sent to Amazon. And Amazon knows that it’s</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:51,259 –&gt; 00:00:57,079<br>the only one that can decrypt the message you sent. This in fact is hard to</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:57,079 –&gt; 00:01:01,420<br>believe if you think about it. It sounds paradoxical. How can secrets it be</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:01,420 –&gt; 00:01:07,140<br>possible using only public info? And in fact the existence of this public key</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:07,140 –&gt; 00:01:12,140<br>crypto system has some genuinely paradoxical consequences which kind of are</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:12,140 –&gt; 00:01:15,739<br>a mind-bender. So let me tell you about one of them. I don’t know if you’ve</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:15,739 –&gt; 00:01:18,700<br>heard of mental chess but it’s a standard thing in the chess world.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:18,700 –&gt; 00:01:24,140<br>chess masters are so talented and have such deep insight into the game that</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:24,140 –&gt; 00:01:27,100<br>they don’t need a chess board and they don’t need chess pieces. They can just</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:27,100 –&gt; 00:01:31,620<br>go for a walk through the on a country lane talking to each other and saying</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,620 –&gt; 00:01:38,540<br>point to king four and and knight to bishop three and just talking chess code and</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:38,540 –&gt; 00:01:42,780<br>playing an entire chess game that way. That’s known as mental chess. It’s quite</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:42,780 –&gt; 00:01:47,379<br>impressive. In fact the grandmasters can play multiple games of mental chess</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:47,420 –&gt; 00:01:51,299<br>against opponents who are staring at the chess board and win the great</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:51,299 –&gt; 00:01:54,939<br>majority of the games. Of course these are not against other grandmasters but</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:54,939 –&gt; 00:02:00,259<br>still. Okay so now this is what I propose. How about playing mental poker? If you</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:00,259 –&gt; 00:02:05,219<br>know how to play poker we deal out cards and we bet and so on and my only</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:05,219 –&gt; 00:02:11,340<br>condition is that I’ll deal. Now that sounds like a joke and an absurd thing</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:11,340 –&gt; 00:02:16,019<br>for you to agree to do but it’s amazing. It’s actually possible. One of the</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:16,020 –&gt; 00:02:24,580<br>famous papers of Revest and Shamir was had to play mental poker using</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:24,580 –&gt; 00:02:33,420<br>public key crypto. So I once tried to persuade an eminent MIT dean who’s an ex</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:33,420 –&gt; 00:02:37,020<br>who’s a physicist researcher about this and he just wouldn’t believe it. He</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:37,020 –&gt; 00:02:42,020<br>argued that it was just impossible logically. And what he was thinking about</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:42,060 –&gt; 00:02:47,540<br>was that if you know how to compute a function then of course you can figure</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:47,540 –&gt; 00:02:54,340<br>out how to invert it. That is to say if I know how to compute some function f of</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:54,340 –&gt; 00:03:00,100<br>a number and let’s say that the function is one arrow in that is an injection</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:00,100 –&gt; 00:03:04,580<br>then if I know what f of n is there’s a unique n that it came from. So how can</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:04,580 –&gt; 00:03:11,140<br>I not be able to find n? And it’s an insight of computer science and complexity</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:11,139 –&gt; 00:03:17,099<br>theory that says it’s quite possible. It’s not that you can’t find the n that</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:17,099 –&gt; 00:03:22,819<br>produced f of n. It’s that the search for it will be prohibitive. There are in</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:22,819 –&gt; 00:03:28,819<br>short one-way function that is functions that are easy to compute in one</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:28,819 –&gt; 00:03:34,019<br>direction but hard to invert. They’re easy to compute but hard to invert. In</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:34,020 –&gt; 00:03:41,740<br>particular we’re thinking about multiplying and factoring. It is an observation</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:41,740 –&gt; 00:03:45,140<br>that it’s easy to compute the product of two large prime numbers. We all know</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:45,140 –&gt; 00:03:50,260<br>how to multiply and in fact there are faster ways to multiply than you know. But</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:50,260 –&gt; 00:03:55,379<br>the current state of our knowledge of number theory and complexity theory is</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:55,379 –&gt; 00:04:01,020<br>that given a number n that happens to be the product of two primes it seems to</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:01,020 –&gt; 00:04:07,900<br>be hopelessly hard in general to factor and into the components p and q. Now</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:07,900 –&gt; 00:04:13,219<br>this is an open problem. It’s similar to the P equals nP question that famous</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:13,219 –&gt; 00:04:20,300<br>open problem. It’s actually a weaker. It’s quite possible that you could factor</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:20,300 –&gt; 00:04:24,860<br>and nP would not equal to nP but nevertheless it’s the same kind of problem and</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:24,860 –&gt; 00:04:28,939<br>more generally the existence of one-way functions is closely related to that</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:28,939 –&gt; 00:04:32,980<br>P equals nP question. Nevertheless even though it’s an open problem and</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:32,980 –&gt; 00:04:38,420<br>theoretically has not been settled either way it’s widely believed. I mean the</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:38,420 –&gt; 00:04:45,939<br>banks the governments and the commercial world have really bet the family</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:45,939 –&gt; 00:04:53,740<br>jewels on the difficulty of factoring when they use the RSA protocol. So I like to</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:53,740 –&gt; 00:05:01,420<br>make the joke that my most important contribution to MIT was being involved in</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:01,420 –&gt; 00:05:10,780<br>the hiring of RSNA. So this is a adi shameer or run revest and l and a</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:10,780 –&gt; 00:05:18,300<br>linadlement back in the late 70s when they first came up with these ideas. So</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:18,819 –&gt; 00:05:25,819<br>let’s look at the way this RSA protocol actually works. So here’s what happens to</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:25,819 –&gt; 00:05:29,740<br>begin with you have to make some information public so that people can</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:29,740 –&gt; 00:05:35,100<br>communicate with you. So there’s a we’re looking at two players here. There’s a</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:35,100 –&gt; 00:05:40,860<br>receiver who’s going to get encrypted messages and there’s a sender who is</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:40,860 –&gt; 00:05:44,860<br>trying to send an encrypted message to the receiver. So what the receiver does</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:44,860 –&gt; 00:05:51,460<br>beforehand is generates two primes P and Q. Now in practice you want these to be</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:51,460 –&gt; 00:05:55,939<br>pretty big primes hundreds of digits and they will examine in a moment the</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:55,939 –&gt; 00:06:01,420<br>question of how you find them but the receiver’s job is to find two quite</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:01,420 –&gt; 00:06:07,020<br>substantial large primes P and Q chosen more or less randomly because if you have</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:07,020 –&gt; 00:06:10,980<br>any kind of predictable procedure for how you got them that would be a</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:10,980 –&gt; 00:06:16,340<br>vulnerability but if you just choose them at random then there’s enough primes</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:16,340 –&gt; 00:06:20,660<br>in the hundreds of digits that it’s hopeless that people would guess which one</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:20,660 –&gt; 00:06:25,259<br>you wound up with. Okay well you do to begin with this multiply P and Q together</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:25,259 –&gt; 00:06:30,300<br>which is easy to do. Let’s call that number N and now the other thing that</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:30,300 –&gt; 00:06:36,259<br>receiver is going to do is find a number E that’s relatively prime to this</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:36,259 –&gt; 00:06:42,019<br>peculiar number P minus 1 Q minus 1. Now as a hint you might notice that P minus</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:42,019 –&gt; 00:06:47,300<br>1 Q minus 1 is in fact a Euler’s function event, Fee event but for now we don’t</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:47,300 –&gt; 00:06:53,300<br>need to understand that this is Euler’s function. It’s just the recipe of what</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:53,300 –&gt; 00:06:57,300<br>the receiver has to do. Find a number E that’s relatively prime to P minus 1</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:57,300 –&gt; 00:07:02,219<br>Q minus 1. Again you don’t want E to be too small and we can we’ll discuss in a</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:02,220 –&gt; 00:07:07,220<br>moment how do you find such an E but the receiver’s job is to find such an E.</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:07,220 –&gt; 00:07:15,260<br>This pair of numbers E and N will be the public key which the receiver</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:15,260 –&gt; 00:07:24,300<br>publishes widely where it can easily be found by anyone who cares to look for it.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:24,300 –&gt; 00:07:27,900<br>Basically there’s a phone directory where if you want to know how to send</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:27,900 –&gt; 00:07:31,740<br>somebody a secret message you look them up and you find the receivers name in</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:31,740 –&gt; 00:07:35,819<br>there and then you see his public E and N and that’s what you use to send him a</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:35,819 –&gt; 00:07:42,660<br>message. Now how do you use it to send him a message? Well I’ll explain that a</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:42,660 –&gt; 00:07:48,120<br>minute but let’s look at one more thing that the receiver needs to do to set</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:48,120 –&gt; 00:07:53,900<br>himself up. The receiver is going to find an inverse of this number E that he’s</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:53,899 –&gt; 00:08:03,259<br>published, the part of his public key, a modulo P minus 1 Q minus 1. That is this</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:03,259 –&gt; 00:08:07,819<br>E since it’s relatively prime to P minus 1 Q minus 1 it will have an inverse</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:07,819 –&gt; 00:08:14,060<br>in Z star P minus 1 Q minus 1. Let’s let that inverse be D and of course we know</p>
<p>90<br>00:08:14,060 –&gt; 00:08:18,979<br>how to find D because you can do that with the pulverizer. D is the private key.</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:18,979 –&gt; 00:08:23,419<br>That’s this crucial piece of information that the receiver has that the</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:23,420 –&gt; 00:08:28,040<br>receiver is not going to tell anybody. Only the receiver knows that because the</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:28,040 –&gt; 00:08:33,080<br>receiver chose the P and the Q and the E more or less randomly maybe even as</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:33,080 –&gt; 00:08:37,019<br>randomly as they can manage and then they find the D and that’s their secret.</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:37,019 –&gt; 00:08:44,200<br>Okay that’s what the receiver does. How does the sender send a message? Well to send</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:44,200 –&gt; 00:08:50,580<br>a message what the the the sender wants to do is choose a message that is in fact</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:50,580 –&gt; 00:08:57,400<br>a number in the range from 1 to N where we’re thinking again of N if it’s a</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:57,400 –&gt; 00:09:02,340<br>product of two primes of a couple hundred digits each then the product is around</p>
<p>99<br>00:09:02,340 –&gt; 00:09:08,500<br>400 digits and so you can pick any number any message am that can be represented</p>
<p>100<br>00:09:08,500 –&gt; 00:09:13,740<br>by a 400 digit number. Now there’s a lot of messages that will fit within 400</p>
<p>101<br>00:09:13,740 –&gt; 00:09:17,259<br>digits and of course if it’s bigger you just break it up into 400 digit</p>
<p>102<br>00:09:17,259 –&gt; 00:09:22,019<br>pieces so that that’s the kind of message you’re going to send. So the message is</p>
<p>103<br>00:09:22,019 –&gt; 00:09:29,460<br>going to be a number in this range from 1 to N and what the sender is going to do is look</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:29,460 –&gt; 00:09:36,379<br>up the public key and the other part of the public key N and raise the secret message to</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:36,379 –&gt; 00:09:46,539<br>the power E in ZN. So we’re going to compute M to the E in ZN and send that encoded message</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:46,539 –&gt; 00:09:54,860<br>M hat. So M hat is what we think of as the encrypted version of the message M. So then</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:54,860 –&gt; 00:09:59,419<br>we have the problem if that’s what the sender sends to the receiver how does the receiver</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:59,419 –&gt; 00:10:05,980<br>decode the message M hat and the answer is the receiver just computes M hat to the power</p>
<p>109<br>00:10:05,980 –&gt; 00:10:14,379<br>D the secret key also in the ring ZN and the claim is that in fact that’s equal to M.</p>
<p>110<br>00:10:14,379 –&gt; 00:10:20,700<br>Now you can check in a class problem and it’s easy to see that the reason why that method</p>
<p>111<br>00:10:20,700 –&gt; 00:10:27,100<br>of decrypting works is precisely an application of Euler’s theorem at least when M happens</p>
<p>112<br>00:10:27,100 –&gt; 00:10:33,939<br>to be relatively prime to N. Now the odds of finding an M that’s not relatively prime</p>
<p>113<br>00:10:33,939 –&gt; 00:10:39,740<br>to N are basically negligible because if you’d find such an M it would enable you to</p>
<p>114<br>00:10:39,740 –&gt; 00:10:45,500<br>factor and believe factoring is very hard but in fact it actually works for all M which is a</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:45,500 –&gt; 00:10:52,220<br>nice theoretical result and you’ll work this out in a class problem. Okay that’s how it works.</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:54,379 –&gt; 00:11:02,779<br>The receiver publishes E and N, keeps the secret key D, the sender expenentiates the message to</p>
<p>117<br>00:11:02,779 –&gt; 00:11:10,379<br>the power E, the receiver simply decodes by raising the receive message to the power D and reads</p>
<p>118<br>00:11:10,379 –&gt; 00:11:16,860<br>off what the original was. Okay so we need to think about the feasibility of all of this because</p>
<p>119<br>00:11:16,860 –&gt; 00:11:24,059<br>we believe that it’s impossible to decrypt but there’s a lot of other stuff going on that the</p>
<p>120<br>00:11:24,059 –&gt; 00:11:28,539<br>players have to be able to perform and let’s examine what their responsibilities and abilities</p>
<p>121<br>00:11:28,539 –&gt; 00:11:34,860<br>have to be. So the receiver to begin with has to be able to find large primes and how on earth do</p>
<p>122<br>00:11:34,860 –&gt; 00:11:41,500<br>they do that? Well without going into too much detail we can make the remark that there are</p>
<p>123<br>00:11:43,179 –&gt; 00:11:48,539<br>lots of primes that is to say by appealing to the prime number theorem we know that</p>
<p>124<br>00:11:48,860 –&gt; 00:11:58,939<br>in among the end digit numbers about log N of them are going to be primes so that you don’t have</p>
<p>125<br>00:11:58,939 –&gt; 00:12:06,860<br>to go too long before you stumble upon a random prime. That is if you’re dealing with a 200 digit</p>
<p>126<br>00:12:08,139 –&gt; 00:12:15,659<br>N and you’re searching for a prime of around that size you’re not going to have to search more than</p>
<p>127<br>00:12:15,659 –&gt; 00:12:21,819<br>a few hundred numbers before you’re likely to stumble on a prime. And of course how do you know</p>
<p>128<br>00:12:21,819 –&gt; 00:12:25,980<br>that you stumbled on a prime? Well you need to be able to check whether a number is prime or not</p>
<p>129<br>00:12:26,620 –&gt; 00:12:31,980<br>and efficiently in order for this whole thing to be feasible so I have to discuss that briefly how do</p>
<p>130<br>00:12:31,980 –&gt; 00:12:39,179<br>you test whether or not a number is prime in an efficient way. The other thing the receiver has to</p>
<p>131<br>00:12:39,500 –&gt; 00:12:47,099<br>do is find an E that’s relatively prime to p-1, q-1 but that’s easy. Well it’s easy because first of all</p>
<p>132<br>00:12:47,099 –&gt; 00:12:56,459<br>if you just kind of randomly guess a medium sized E and then search consecutively from some random</p>
<p>133<br>00:12:56,459 –&gt; 00:13:04,699<br>number you’ve chosen somewhere in the middle of the interval up to p-1, q-1. Again you’re</p>
<p>134<br>00:13:05,340 –&gt; 00:13:13,980<br>likely very likely to find in a few steps a number E that is relatively prime to p-1, q-1. How do</p>
<p>135<br>00:13:13,980 –&gt; 00:13:20,060<br>you recognize that it’s relatively prime? Well you just compute the GCD which we know how to do using</p>
<p>136<br>00:13:20,060 –&gt; 00:13:25,340<br>Euclid’s algorithm so that’s really quite efficient. Recognizing that it’s relatively prime is easy</p>
<p>137<br>00:13:25,340 –&gt; 00:13:30,300<br>and you just don’t have to search very many numbers until you stumble on an E. Okay the other</p>
<p>138<br>00:13:30,299 –&gt; 00:13:37,979<br>thing you have to do is find the D that’s an E inverse modulo p-1, q-1 and again that is the</p>
<p>139<br>00:13:37,979 –&gt; 00:13:46,139<br>extended Euclidean algorithm, the extended GCD namely the pulverizer. So those are the pieces</p>
<p>140<br>00:13:46,139 –&gt; 00:13:52,699<br>that the receiver has to do. Now let’s look at this a little bit more and think about the information</p>
<p>141<br>00:13:52,699 –&gt; 00:13:57,659<br>about the prime. So the famous theorem about the primes is their density which is if you let a</p>
<p>142<br>00:13:57,659 –&gt; 00:14:05,579<br>pi of n be the number of primes less than or equal to n then it’s a deep theorem of number theory</p>
<p>143<br>00:14:05,579 –&gt; 00:14:13,259<br>that pi of n actually approaches a limit in an asymptotic sense which we’ll discuss in more</p>
<p>144<br>00:14:13,259 –&gt; 00:14:20,620<br>detail but that pi of n as n grows gets to be very close to n over log n that’s the natural log</p>
<p>145<br>00:14:20,620 –&gt; 00:14:27,820<br>of n and then now that’s a deep theorem but in fact if we want a self-contained treatment for</p>
<p>146<br>00:14:27,820 –&gt; 00:14:34,139<br>our purposes there’s an exercise that will be in the text where we can derive Chebbi Chev’s</p>
<p>147<br>00:14:34,139 –&gt; 00:14:39,740<br>bound which is weaker than the tight prime number theorem but Chebbi Chev’s bound which can</p>
<p>148<br>00:14:39,740 –&gt; 00:14:44,940<br>be proved by more elementary means that’s within the ability of our own ability at this point with</p>
<p>149<br>00:14:44,940 –&gt; 00:14:52,220<br>the number theory we have to be able to show that n over 4 log n is a lower bound on pi of n.</p>
<p>150<br>00:14:53,020 –&gt; 00:14:59,100<br>So basically that says that if you’re dealing with numbers of numbers of size n which means</p>
<p>151<br>00:14:59,100 –&gt; 00:15:06,620<br>there are length log n a few hundred digits then you only have to search maybe a thousand digits</p>
<p>152<br>00:15:06,620 –&gt; 00:15:12,380<br>before you’re very likely to stumble on a prime and if you search 2000 digits it becomes</p>
<p>153<br>00:15:13,100 –&gt; 00:15:18,220<br>extremely likely that it will stumble on a prime so the primes are dense enough that we can</p>
<p>154<br>00:15:18,220 –&gt; 00:15:23,419<br>afford to look for them providing we can have a reasonably fast way to recognize when a number is</p>
<p>155<br>00:15:23,419 –&gt; 00:15:31,179<br>prime well one simple way that it almost is perfect but works pragmatically pretty well is called</p>
<p>156<br>00:15:31,179 –&gt; 00:15:36,860<br>the firm I test but let me just emphasize this remark I got ahead of myself that if I’m dealing</p>
<p>157<br>00:15:36,860 –&gt; 00:15:42,620<br>with 200 digit numbers then about one in a thousand is prime using just the weaker Chebbi Chev’s bound</p>
<p>158<br>00:15:42,620 –&gt; 00:15:48,139<br>and that says that I don’t have to search too long only a few thousand numbers to be able to</p>
<p>159<br>00:15:48,139 –&gt; 00:15:53,740<br>find a prime and you know a few thousand numbers as well within the ability of a of a computer to</p>
<p>160<br>00:15:53,740 –&gt; 00:15:59,100<br>carry out providing that the test for recognizing that a number is prime isn’t too time consuming.</p>
<p>161<br>00:15:59,820 –&gt; 00:16:07,740<br>So one naive way that that really almost works to be a reliable primality test is to check whether</p>
<p>162<br>00:16:08,300 –&gt; 00:16:12,940<br>a firmost theorem is obeyed. Firmost theorem, the special case of Euler’s theorem says that</p>
<p>163<br>00:16:12,940 –&gt; 00:16:21,180<br>if n is prime then if I compute a number a to the n minus one it’s going to equal one in z n</p>
<p>164<br>00:16:22,300 –&gt; 00:16:26,779<br>and that’s going to be the case for all a that are not zero if n is prime.</p>
<p>165<br>00:16:26,779 –&gt; 00:16:36,379<br>Now that means that if this equality fails in z n then I immediately know a is not prime go on search</p>
<p>166<br>00:16:36,379 –&gt; 00:16:45,740<br>for another one. Okay so suppose I’m unlucky or lucky and I choose an a to test and it turns out</p>
<p>167<br>00:16:45,740 –&gt; 00:16:51,740<br>that a to the n minus one is one does that mean that n is prime unfortunately not it might be that</p>
<p>168<br>00:16:51,740 –&gt; 00:17:00,460<br>there’s that I just hit an n that happened to satisfy firmost equation even though n was not prime</p>
<p>169<br>00:17:00,460 –&gt; 00:17:09,339<br>but it’s not a very hard thing to prove that if n is not prime then half of the numbers</p>
<p>170<br>00:17:10,779 –&gt; 00:17:17,259<br>from one to n are not going to pass the firmost. So if half of the numbers are not going to pass the</p>
<p>171<br>00:17:17,819 –&gt; 00:17:23,339<br>the firmost then what I can do is just choose a random non-zero number in the interval from one to</p>
<p>172<br>00:17:23,339 –&gt; 00:17:31,819<br>n raise it to the n minus first power and see what happens and if n is not prime the probability</p>
<p>173<br>00:17:31,819 –&gt; 00:17:39,980<br>that this random number that I’ve chosen fails this test is at least a half. So I try it 50 times</p>
<p>174<br>00:17:39,980 –&gt; 00:17:46,140<br>and if in fact 50 randomly chosen a’s in this in the interval from one to n all satisfy</p>
<p>175<br>00:17:47,259 –&gt; 00:17:56,940<br>firmost theorem then there’s one chance in two to the minus 50th that in two to the 50th rather</p>
<p>176<br>00:17:56,940 –&gt; 00:18:04,619<br>that n is not prime that’s a great bet leap for it. So that basically is the idea of a probabilistic</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:04,619 –&gt; 00:18:10,220<br>primality test. Now there’s a small complication which is that there are certain numbers n where</p>
<p>178<br>00:18:10,779 –&gt; 00:18:17,500<br>this property that half the numbers will fail to satisfy firmost theorem doesn’t hold</p>
<p>179<br>00:18:17,500 –&gt; 00:18:22,059<br>there known as the Carmichael numbers in there known to be pretty sparse so that really if you’re</p>
<p>180<br>00:18:22,059 –&gt; 00:18:27,420<br>choosing an n that had random which is kind of what we’re doing when we choose random prime’s</p>
<p>181<br>00:18:27,420 –&gt; 00:18:32,220<br>p and q the likelihood that you’ll stumble on a Carmichael number is another thing that you just</p>
<p>182<br>00:18:32,220 –&gt; 00:18:38,460<br>don’t have to worry about. So really the firmost primality test is a plausible pragmatic test that</p>
<p>183<br>00:18:38,460 –&gt; 00:18:45,340<br>you could use to pretty reliably detect whether or not a number was prime what was the last component</p>
<p>184<br>00:18:45,340 –&gt; 00:18:52,140<br>of the powers that we needed the receiver to have. Okay so now we come to the question of why</p>
<p>185<br>00:18:53,019 –&gt; 00:18:58,940<br>do we believe that the RSA protocol is secure and the first thing to notice is that if you could</p>
<p>186<br>00:18:58,940 –&gt; 00:19:06,779<br>factor n then it’s easy to break because if you can factor n then you have the p and the q and</p>
<p>187<br>00:19:06,779 –&gt; 00:19:13,019<br>that means you know what p minus 1 times q minus 1 is and therefore you can use the pulverizer</p>
<p>188<br>00:19:13,019 –&gt; 00:19:19,019<br>in exactly the same way the receiver did to find the inverse of the public key you could find the</p>
<p>189<br>00:19:19,019 –&gt; 00:19:26,460<br>easily. So surely if if you can factor then RSA breaks no question about that. What about the</p>
<p>190<br>00:19:26,460 –&gt; 00:19:32,700<br>converse? Well what you can approve and there’s an argument that’s sketched in a class problem not</p>
<p>191<br>00:19:32,700 –&gt; 00:19:41,980<br>fully in the book is that if I could find the private key d then in fact I could also factor n.</p>
<p>192<br>00:19:41,980 –&gt; 00:19:49,340<br>So if I believe that factoring is hard then in fact finding the secret key is also hard and we</p>
<p>193<br>00:19:49,340 –&gt; 00:19:54,220<br>could try to be confident that our secret key is not going to be found even given the public key.</p>
<p>194<br>00:19:54,779 –&gt; 00:20:01,019<br>Now unfortunately this is not the strongest kind of security guarantee you’d like.</p>
<p>195<br>00:20:03,259 –&gt; 00:20:08,140<br>Because there’s a logical possibility that you might be able to decrypt messages without</p>
<p>196<br>00:20:08,140 –&gt; 00:20:13,580<br>knowing the secret key. Maybe there’s some other walk around whereby you can decrypt the secret</p>
<p>197<br>00:20:13,580 –&gt; 00:20:20,220<br>message m hat by a method other than raising it to the death power and what you really like is a</p>
<p>198<br>00:20:20,220 –&gt; 00:20:28,059<br>theorem of security that said that breaking RSA, reading RSA messages by any means whatsoever</p>
<p>199<br>00:20:28,059 –&gt; 00:20:33,819<br>would be as hard as factoring. That’s not known for RSA. It’s an open problem. And so RSA doesn’t have</p>
<p>200<br>00:20:33,819 –&gt; 00:20:42,139<br>the theoretically most desirable security assurance but we really believe in it and the reason we</p>
<p>201<br>00:20:42,139 –&gt; 00:20:47,659<br>really believe in it is that for a hundred or more years mathematicians and number theorists have</p>
<p>202<br>00:20:47,659 –&gt; 00:20:55,899<br>been trying to find efficient ways to factor and more pragmatically the most sophisticated cryptographers</p>
<p>203<br>00:20:55,900 –&gt; 00:21:02,700<br>and decoders in the world using the most powerful networks of supercomputers have been attacking RSA</p>
<p>204<br>00:21:02,700 –&gt; 00:21:10,540<br>for 35 years and have yet to crack it. Now the truth is that in the course of the 35 years various</p>
<p>205<br>00:21:10,540 –&gt; 00:21:18,860<br>kinds of glitches were found that required some added rules about how you found the P in the Q</p>
<p>206<br>00:21:18,859 –&gt; 00:21:27,099<br>and how you found the E but they were easily identified and fixed and RSA really is a robust</p>
<p>207<br>00:21:28,539 –&gt; 00:21:36,379<br>encryption method, public key encryption method that has withstood attack for all these years and</p>
<p>208<br>00:21:36,379 –&gt; 00:21:39,819<br>that’s why we believe in it.</p>
