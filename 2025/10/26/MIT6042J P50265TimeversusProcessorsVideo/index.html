                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,000<br>The example of scheduling courses in terms is really a special case of a general problem</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,000 –&gt; 00:00:13,000<br>that you can probably see of scheduling a bunch of tasks or jobs under constraints of which</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:13,000 –&gt; 00:00:19,000<br>ones have to be done before other ones, which is a topic that comes up actually in lots of applications,</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:19,000 –&gt; 00:00:25,000<br>but you can see applications in computer science where you might have a complex calculation,</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:25,000 –&gt; 00:00:29,000<br>pieces of which could be done in parallel and other parts had to be done in order,</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,000 –&gt; 00:00:33,000<br>and later results depended on the results of an earlier computation.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:33,000 –&gt; 00:00:36,000<br>It leads us to the general discussion of parallel scheduling,</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:36,000 –&gt; 00:00:42,000<br>and we’ve already worked out some theory of that really, just from the example.</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:42,000 –&gt; 00:00:46,000<br>Namely, if we look at the minimum number of terms to graduate,</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:46,000 –&gt; 00:00:51,000<br>this corresponds to the minimum amount of number of stages,</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:51,000 –&gt; 00:00:55,000<br>or the minimum amount of time that it takes to process a bunch of tasks,</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:55,000 –&gt; 00:01:02,000<br>assuming that you can do tasks in parallel and as many in parallel as you need to,</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,000 –&gt; 00:01:05,000<br>that there’s no limit on the amount of parallelism allowed.</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:05,000 –&gt; 00:01:12,000<br>In that case, what we can say is that the minimum parallel time for a bunch of constrained tasks</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:12,000 –&gt; 00:01:17,000<br>is simply the maximum chain size in the constraint graph.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:17,000 –&gt; 00:01:22,000<br>We saw that example with the course prerequisites where we had five,</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:23,000 –&gt; 00:01:25,000<br>and in general, this is the theorem.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:25,000 –&gt; 00:01:31,000<br>Minimum parallel time is exactly equal to maximum chain size for chains in the graph</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:31,000 –&gt; 00:01:35,000<br>that constrains the order in which tasks can be completed.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:35,000 –&gt; 00:01:38,000<br>Now, what about the maximum term load?</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:38,000 –&gt; 00:01:47,000<br>Well, that corresponds to the number of processors you need to be doing tasks in parallel.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:48,000 –&gt; 00:01:54,000<br>For the course scheduling example, it means how many subjects can you take in one term,</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:54,000 –&gt; 00:02:04,000<br>but if you were doing computations, how many separate CPUs would you need in order to be able to fully utilize the parallelism</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:04,000 –&gt; 00:02:10,000<br>to as much in parallel as you possibly could, and a bound on the number of processors that are needed</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:10,000 –&gt; 00:02:14,000<br>for minimum time is simply the maximum anti-chain size,</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:15,000 –&gt; 00:02:21,000<br>which in the example from the previous segment on course scheduling turns out there were five courses you could take in one term,</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:21,000 –&gt; 00:02:25,000<br>the second term, and that was, in fact, the maximum anti-chain size.</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:25,000 –&gt; 00:02:29,000<br>So that’s an upper bound on the number of processes that you need,</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:29,000 –&gt; 00:02:32,000<br>the number of processors that you need to achieve minimum time,</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:32,000 –&gt; 00:02:39,000<br>but in fact, it’s a course upper bound because although the number of processors needed to achieve minimum parallel time</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:40,000 –&gt; 00:02:42,000<br>is at most the maximum anti-chain size.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:42,000 –&gt; 00:02:46,000<br>In fact, in the previous example, it turns out you could get away with three processes.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:46,000 –&gt; 00:02:54,000<br>It was possible to schedule the subjects, so you only took three courses a term and still finished in minimum time.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:54,000 –&gt; 00:02:56,000<br>So can you do better than three subjects?</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:56,000 –&gt; 00:03:01,000<br>Well, there’s a trivial argument that says no, you can’t because in that previous example,</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:01,000 –&gt; 00:03:04,000<br>we had 13 subjects to schedule.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:04,000 –&gt; 00:03:09,000<br>The maximum chain size was five, so it was going to take at least five terms.</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:09,000 –&gt; 00:03:14,000<br>So that means you have to distribute these 13 subjects among five terms.</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:14,000 –&gt; 00:03:22,000<br>There has to be some term that has at least the average number of subjects, namely 13 divided by five.</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:22,000 –&gt; 00:03:28,000<br>So that means there has to be a term in which you’re taking 13 divided by five subjects.</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:28,000 –&gt; 00:03:31,000<br>Of course, you round up because it has to be an integer.</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:31,000 –&gt; 00:03:40,000<br>So the minimum number of terms to finish and graduate finishing these 13 subjects in five terms is three,</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:40,000 –&gt; 00:03:43,000<br>because 13 divided by five rounded up is three.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:43,000 –&gt; 00:03:47,000<br>This is a general phenomenon that applies.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:47,000 –&gt; 00:03:56,000<br>What we can say is that if you have a dag with n vertices and the maximum chain size is C,</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:56,000 –&gt; 00:03:59,000<br>so that’s how deep it can be at most.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:59,000 –&gt; 00:04:06,000<br>And the maximum anti-chain size is A, that’s the largest number of things that you could ever possibly do in parallel.</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:06,000 –&gt; 00:04:13,000<br>Then clearly the total number of vertices is C times A at most.</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:13,000 –&gt; 00:04:25,000<br>So the total number of tasks that you can do where you are going to finish in C steps using at most A processors is bounded by C times A.</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:25,000 –&gt; 00:04:32,000<br>So what that tells you is that you can’t both have the anti-chain size and the chain size be too small,</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:32,000 –&gt; 00:04:34,000<br>because their product has to be at least n.</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:34,000 –&gt; 00:04:39,000<br>That can be rephrased as a little lemma that is credited to a guy named Dilworth.</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:39,000 –&gt; 00:04:44,000<br>Dilworth is actually famous for Dilworth’s theorem of which this Dilworth’s lemma is a special case,</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:44,000 –&gt; 00:04:46,000<br>but we don’t need the general theorem.</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:46,000 –&gt; 00:04:52,000<br>Dilworth’s lemma says that if you have an n vertex dag, then for any number T,</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:52,000 –&gt; 00:04:59,000<br>it either has a chain of size bigger than T, or it has an anti-chain of size greater than or equal to n over T,</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:59,000 –&gt; 00:05:05,000<br>and we proved that this on the previous slide, the product of these two things has to be at least n,</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:05,000 –&gt; 00:05:10,000<br>and the general case is T times n over T is greater than or equal to n.</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:10,000 –&gt; 00:05:13,000<br>And this holds for all T between 1 and n.</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:13,000 –&gt; 00:05:16,000<br>Well, let’s think of a simple application of that.</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:16,000 –&gt; 00:05:23,000<br>I choose the T that balances anti-chain size from a chain size, then I choose T to be the square root of n.</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:23,000 –&gt; 00:05:28,000<br>So over here I have square root of n, and here I have n divided by the square root of n, which is also square root of n.</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:28,000 –&gt; 00:05:37,000<br>And what we can conclude is that every n vertex dag has either a chain of size at least a square root of n,</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:37,000 –&gt; 00:05:40,000<br>or an anti-chain of size at least square root of n.</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:40,000 –&gt; 00:05:47,000<br>This turns out to actually have a few applications, but we’re just going to look at a fun application of this remark</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:47,000 –&gt; 00:05:52,000<br>that you have to have a chain or an anti-chain of size at least square root of n.</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:52,000 –&gt; 00:06:00,000<br>You might have only one of these, you might have both, but one or the other has to be at least as big a square root of n.</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:00,000 –&gt; 00:06:04,000<br>Let’s think of a new dag that I’m going to construct as follows.</p>
<p>69<br>00:06:04,000 –&gt; 00:06:13,000<br>I’m going to draw an edge between students in the class, and I’m going to think of one student as having a direct edge to another student,</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:13,000 –&gt; 00:06:21,000<br>if the first student is both shorter and younger, actually, meaning no taller than and no older than the other.</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:21,000 –&gt; 00:06:27,000<br>Let’s just say shorter, meaning shorter, or possibly the same height, younger, or possibly the same edge.</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:27,000 –&gt; 00:06:34,000<br>The rule is that if I think of a student as being represented by their shortness s and their age a,</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:34,000 –&gt; 00:06:44,000<br>then a student with height s1 and age a1 has a direct arrow to another student with height s2 and age a2,</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:44,000 –&gt; 00:06:51,000<br>providing that the first pair is less than or equal to the second pair in both coordinates.</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:51,000 –&gt; 00:06:56,000<br>s1 is less than or equal to s2, and a1 is less than or equal to a2.</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:56,000 –&gt; 00:07:03,000<br>Now we don’t want ties here because that would break the dag property if I have two students with exactly the same age and height.</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:03,000 –&gt; 00:07:12,000<br>So let’s assume that we are measuring age and microseconds and height in micrometers, and with that kind of fineness, the likelihood of a tie is pretty low.</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:12,000 –&gt; 00:07:15,000<br>So then it becomes a dag again.</p>
<p>79<br>00:07:15,000 –&gt; 00:07:27,000<br>So this is the definition of taking a dag built out of pairs of, there’s a pure dag for height and there’s a pure dag for age,</p>
<p>80<br>00:07:27,000 –&gt; 00:07:33,000<br>and I combine them into pairs and I get a new dag by looking at how the coordinates behave together.</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:33,000 –&gt; 00:07:44,000<br>This is called the product graph. It’s a general construction that comes up, and we will talk a little bit more about when we re-examine dag’s in the context of the language of relation.</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:44,000 –&gt; 00:07:49,000<br>So this is the product graph.</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:49,000 –&gt; 00:08:05,000<br>According to Dilworth’s lemma in a class like ours of 141 students, it means that we’re going to have a chain or an anti-chain in this product dag of size, square root of 141 rounded up or 12.</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:06,000 –&gt; 00:08:17,000<br>So what would, according to Dilworth’s lemma in this particular age height graph, what does it mean for this to be an anti-chain?</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:17,000 –&gt; 00:08:26,000<br>Suppose I take a bunch of students and I line them up in order of size with the bigger, the tallest on the left and the shortest on the right.</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:26,000 –&gt; 00:08:35,000<br>If this is going to be an anti-chain, it means that they have to be getting older as they get shorter.</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:35,000 –&gt; 00:08:45,000<br>Because if I ever had a case where somebody to the right was both shorter and younger than somebody to the left, it wouldn’t be an anti-chain because they’d be comparable.</p>
<p>88<br>00:08:45,000 –&gt; 00:08:55,000<br>So this is an anti-chain, according to Dilworth’s lemma, if you sort the students by height, they have to be getting older as they get shorter.</p>
<p>89<br>00:08:55,000 –&gt; 00:09:01,000<br>If it was a chain, they would be getting younger as they got shorter.</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:01,000 –&gt; 00:09:08,000<br>But the more interesting one is when they get is the anti-chain in this height birthday example.</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:08,000 –&gt; 00:09:15,000<br>So we should be looking at, well, will either have a chain or an anti-chain in this class, according to this product dag.</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:15,000 –&gt; 00:09:22,000<br>As a matter of fact, we really had an anti-chain that here’s a quick list of a dozen students.</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:22,000 –&gt; 00:09:38,000<br>And indeed, if you look at the birthdays, there’s somebody who’s six-one was born in August, 94, and then somebody who was born in April, 94, and is six-o, all the way down to somebody who was born in 1991, and who’s five feet tall.</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:38,000 –&gt; 00:09:44,000<br>So we looked out, we could have only had the chain, but we actually had the anti-chain in this case.</p>
