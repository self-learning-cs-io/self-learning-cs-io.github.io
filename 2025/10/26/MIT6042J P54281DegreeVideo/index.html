                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,100<br>So now we start on another topic in graph theory, namely the topic of simple graphs.</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,100 –&gt; 00:00:10,560<br>So last week we were talking about directed graphs where the arrows have a beginning and</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,560 –&gt; 00:00:12,800<br>end as shown here.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,800 –&gt; 00:00:14,460<br>But simple graphs are simpler.</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:14,460 –&gt; 00:00:18,000<br>The arrows, the edges don’t have direction.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:18,000 –&gt; 00:00:23,679<br>They just correspond to a con-a-mutual connection, which is symmetric.</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:23,679 –&gt; 00:00:29,719<br>So there’s a picture of a simple graph and the edges are shown without an arrow head.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:29,719 –&gt; 00:00:33,560<br>The whole thing about directed graphs is that it’s possible to have an arrow going in each</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:33,560 –&gt; 00:00:35,839<br>direction between two vertices.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:35,839 –&gt; 00:00:39,000<br>But when we have undirected edges like this, that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:39,000 –&gt; 00:00:43,960<br>So there’s only one edge between a pair of vertices in a simple graph.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:43,960 –&gt; 00:00:50,920<br>In addition, a directed graph might have a self-loop and edge that starts and ends at the</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:50,920 –&gt; 00:00:52,079<br>same vertex.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:52,079 –&gt; 00:00:54,679<br>And those are also disallowed in simple graphs.</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:54,679 –&gt; 00:00:56,359<br>Now you could allow those things.</p>
<p>16<br>00:00:56,359 –&gt; 00:01:01,200<br>There’s a thing called multi-graphs where there are multiple edges between vertices and</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:01,200 –&gt; 00:01:02,640<br>there could also be self-loops.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:02,640 –&gt; 00:01:03,640<br>But we don’t need those.</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:03,640 –&gt; 00:01:05,319<br>Let’s not complicate matters.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:05,319 –&gt; 00:01:07,439<br>We’re talking about simple graphs.</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:07,439 –&gt; 00:01:08,439<br>Okay.</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:08,439 –&gt; 00:01:13,840<br>So the formal definition of a simple graph is that it’s an object G that has a bunch of parts.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:13,840 –&gt; 00:01:21,680<br>Namely, it has a non-empty set V of vertices, just like directed graphs.</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:21,680 –&gt; 00:01:24,680<br>And it has a set of E, a set E of edges.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:24,680 –&gt; 00:01:28,480<br>But the edges now are somewhat different since they don’t have beginnings and ends.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:28,480 –&gt; 00:01:34,040<br>And edge just has two endpoints that are in V. And we don’t distinguish the endpoints.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:34,040 –&gt; 00:01:35,800<br>So let’s just draw a picture.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:35,800 –&gt; 00:01:39,280<br>Here’s a case where there are six vertices V shown in blue.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:39,280 –&gt; 00:01:41,800<br>And there are these undirected edges shown in green.</p>
<p>30<br>00:01:41,800 –&gt; 00:01:47,760<br>In this case, I see seven edges in E.</p>
<p>31<br>00:01:47,760 –&gt; 00:01:51,960<br>There’s an example of an edge that goes between two vertices that I’ve highlighted in yellow</p>
<p>32<br>00:01:51,960 –&gt; 00:01:52,960<br>in red.</p>
<p>33<br>00:01:52,960 –&gt; 00:01:55,719<br>And we’ve made that particular edge dark green.</p>
<p>34<br>00:01:55,719 –&gt; 00:02:01,000<br>And edge like that can formally be represented as just the set of its endpoints, a set of two</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:01,000 –&gt; 00:02:03,719<br>things, red and yellow.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:03,719 –&gt; 00:02:09,920<br>In text, we’ll often indicate it as the two vertices connected by a horizontal bar.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:09,920 –&gt; 00:02:14,280<br>But you have to remember that the order in which the red and the yellow occur don’t matter</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:14,280 –&gt; 00:02:17,240<br>because it’s really a set consisting of red and yellow.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:17,240 –&gt; 00:02:22,600<br>When two vertices are connected by an edge, there’s said to be adjacent.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:22,600 –&gt; 00:02:28,000<br>And the edge is said to be incident to its endpoints, just a little vocabulary that we use</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:28,000 –&gt; 00:02:29,800<br>here.</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:29,800 –&gt; 00:02:34,640<br>Now, a basic concept in graph theory, which is what we’re going to make a little bit of</p>
<p>43<br>00:02:34,640 –&gt; 00:02:38,719<br>in this video segment, is the idea of the degree of a vertex.</p>
<p>44<br>00:02:38,719 –&gt; 00:02:42,840<br>The degree of a vertex is simply the number of incident edges, the number of edges that</p>
<p>45<br>00:02:42,840 –&gt; 00:02:45,920<br>touch it, the number of edges for which it’s an endpoint.</p>
<p>46<br>00:02:45,919 –&gt; 00:02:49,359<br>So let’s look at the red vertex.</p>
<p>47<br>00:02:49,359 –&gt; 00:02:53,560<br>There are two edges incident to the red vertex, so its degree is two.</p>
<p>48<br>00:02:53,560 –&gt; 00:02:56,359<br>Okay, let’s look at the yellow vertex.</p>
<p>49<br>00:02:56,359 –&gt; 00:03:02,039<br>Here, there are four edges incident to the yellow vertex, so its degree is four.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:02,039 –&gt; 00:03:04,319<br>No surprises yet.</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:04,319 –&gt; 00:03:11,439<br>So let’s examine some properties of vertex degrees that are motivated by a simple example.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:11,439 –&gt; 00:03:17,199<br>Suppose I asked the question, is it possible to have a graph with vertex degrees of two,</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:17,199 –&gt; 00:03:18,199<br>two and one?</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:18,199 –&gt; 00:03:23,639<br>So implicitly, it’s a three vertex graph, and one vertex has degree two, and other has</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:23,639 –&gt; 00:03:25,280<br>degree two and one has degree one.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:25,280 –&gt; 00:03:27,439<br>Well, let’s see what it looks like.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:27,439 –&gt; 00:03:30,840<br>If I’m going to have a vertex of degree one, then I know what it looks like.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:30,840 –&gt; 00:03:31,840<br>There’s the vertex.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:31,840 –&gt; 00:03:32,840<br>It’s got one edge out of it.</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:32,840 –&gt; 00:03:34,639<br>It’s going to some other vertex.</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:34,639 –&gt; 00:03:41,000<br>Now, this other vertex must have degree two, so it’s connected to something else, and</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:41,000 –&gt; 00:03:45,439<br>something else must be another vertex with degree two, because those are the only possible</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:45,439 –&gt; 00:03:47,879<br>spectrum of degrees, one, two, and two.</p>
<p>64<br>00:03:47,879 –&gt; 00:03:54,039<br>And that means that this last guy has to have an edge out of it, because it’s degree two,</p>
<p>65<br>00:03:54,039 –&gt; 00:03:56,599<br>and it can’t go back to two, because there aren’t any.</p>
<p>66<br>00:03:56,599 –&gt; 00:03:59,560<br>There’s already an edge between these two, and it can’t go back to one, because that has</p>
<p>67<br>00:03:59,560 –&gt; 00:04:01,560<br>degree one, so we’re stuck.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:01,560 –&gt; 00:04:06,639<br>And by this ad hoc reasoning, we figured out that there can’t be a degree three graph</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:06,639 –&gt; 00:04:09,920<br>with this spectrum of degrees, two to one.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:09,919 –&gt; 00:04:11,559<br>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:11,559 –&gt; 00:04:17,000<br>Well, we could have reasoned more generally, and there’s a very elementary property of degrees</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:17,000 –&gt; 00:04:20,839<br>that we’re going to actually make something of in a minute, and it’s called a handshaking</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:20,839 –&gt; 00:04:21,839<br>lemma.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:21,839 –&gt; 00:04:27,360<br>It says that the sum of the degrees, summed over all the vertices, is equal to twice the</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:27,360 –&gt; 00:04:28,919<br>number of edges.</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:28,919 –&gt; 00:04:34,480<br>There it is written as a formula, twice the number of edges, so that’s the cardinality symbol.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:34,480 –&gt; 00:04:37,480<br>Absolute value of a set means the size of the set.</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:37,480 –&gt; 00:04:38,480<br>Here is finite.</p>
<p>79<br>00:04:38,520 –&gt; 00:04:43,040<br>Twice the number of edges is equal to the sum over all the vertices of the degree of the</p>
<p>80<br>00:04:43,040 –&gt; 00:04:44,040<br>vertices.</p>
<p>81<br>00:04:44,040 –&gt; 00:04:45,520<br>Why is that true?</p>
<p>82<br>00:04:45,520 –&gt; 00:04:51,560<br>Well, if you think about it, and the sum on the right, every edge is counted twice,</p>
<p>83<br>00:04:51,560 –&gt; 00:04:54,720<br>once for each vertex that it’s the end of.</p>
<p>84<br>00:04:54,720 –&gt; 00:04:56,520<br>So we’re really just counting.</p>
<p>85<br>00:04:56,520 –&gt; 00:05:02,560<br>This is way of summing up over all of the vertices in which each vertex gets numerated</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:02,560 –&gt; 00:05:07,120<br>twice, so the sum is twice the number of vertices, and the proof is kind of trivial.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:07,120 –&gt; 00:05:08,280<br>So let’s make something of this.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:08,280 –&gt; 00:05:11,079<br>You might wonder why it’s called the handshaking lemma.</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:11,079 –&gt; 00:05:15,319<br>That will emerge in some problems that we’re going to have you to do.</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:15,319 –&gt; 00:05:21,079<br>But let’s go on and apply the handshaking lemma in an interesting way.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:21,079 –&gt; 00:05:25,439<br>By the way, of course, since 2 plus 2 plus 1 is odd, we could have without that ad hoc</p>
<p>92<br>00:05:25,439 –&gt; 00:05:32,240<br>analysis figured out that the sum of the degrees can’t be odd, because it’s twice something.</p>
<p>93<br>00:05:32,240 –&gt; 00:05:35,759<br>All right, so here’s the application that’s designed to get your attention.</p>
<p>94<br>00:05:35,759 –&gt; 00:05:39,480<br>It is an application of graph theory to sex.</p>
<p>95<br>00:05:39,480 –&gt; 00:05:43,360<br>And we ask the question, are men more promiscuous than women?</p>
<p>96<br>00:05:43,360 –&gt; 00:05:48,439<br>And there have been repeated studies that are cited in the notes that show again and again</p>
<p>97<br>00:05:48,439 –&gt; 00:05:53,279<br>that when they survey collections of men and women, they ask them how many sexual partners</p>
<p>98<br>00:05:53,279 –&gt; 00:05:54,279<br>they have.</p>
<p>99<br>00:05:54,279 –&gt; 00:05:59,639<br>It’s consistently the case that the men are assessed to have 30% more, 75% more, sometimes</p>
<p>100<br>00:05:59,639 –&gt; 00:06:04,439<br>2.5 times, three times as many partners as the women.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:04,439 –&gt; 00:06:06,719<br>And there’s got to be something wacky about this.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:06,719 –&gt; 00:06:11,199<br>We’re going to come up with a very elementary graph theoretic argument that says that this</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:11,199 –&gt; 00:06:14,719<br>is complete nonsense.</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:14,719 –&gt; 00:06:19,360<br>By the way, the most recent study that we could find was one that’s mentioned in the notes</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:19,360 –&gt; 00:06:24,240<br>in 2007 by the US Department of Health.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:24,240 –&gt; 00:06:28,800<br>And the statistician who collected the data knew that the results were impossible, but</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:28,800 –&gt; 00:06:33,160<br>her job was to report the data, not to explain it or interpret it.</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:33,160 –&gt; 00:06:38,600<br>And the men reported 30% more partners than the women.</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:38,600 –&gt; 00:06:41,879<br>And we’re going to show that somebody’s lying.</p>
<p>110<br>00:06:41,879 –&gt; 00:06:42,879<br>Here’s how we’re going to do it.</p>
<p>111<br>00:06:42,879 –&gt; 00:06:49,240<br>We’re going to model the relationships between men and women by having a graph that comes</p>
<p>112<br>00:06:49,240 –&gt; 00:06:50,240<br>in two parts.</p>
<p>113<br>00:06:50,240 –&gt; 00:06:52,800<br>It’s going to be called a so-called bipartite graph.</p>
<p>114<br>00:06:52,800 –&gt; 00:06:57,439<br>So there’s going to be one set of vertices called M. And another set of vertices called</p>
<p>115<br>00:06:57,439 –&gt; 00:07:02,279<br>F, M for men and F for women or females.</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:02,279 –&gt; 00:07:09,000<br>And where are going to have edges going between men and women between M’s and F’s precisely</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:09,000 –&gt; 00:07:13,160<br>when they have been involved in a sexual liaison.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:13,160 –&gt; 00:07:24,879<br>So looking back at this graph, this edge from that blue M to that orange F indicates that</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:24,879 –&gt; 00:07:28,360<br>they had a sexual liaison.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:28,360 –&gt; 00:07:30,079<br>They were partners.</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:30,079 –&gt; 00:07:36,399<br>OK, so this is a simple graph structure that we can use to represent who got together</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:36,399 –&gt; 00:07:41,879<br>with whom in any given population of men and women.</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:41,879 –&gt; 00:07:47,439<br>Now if you think about the same argument that we use for handshaking, if you sum the</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:47,439 –&gt; 00:07:53,159<br>degrees of the men, you’re counting each edge exactly once.</p>
<p>125<br>00:07:53,160 –&gt; 00:07:57,840<br>And so the sum of the degrees of the men is equal to the number of edges in this graph.</p>
<p>126<br>00:07:57,840 –&gt; 00:08:04,560<br>And likewise, if you sum over the females, you’re counting each edge once.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:04,560 –&gt; 00:08:08,400<br>And so the sum of the female degrees is also equal to the number of edges.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:08,400 –&gt; 00:08:14,680<br>In particular, the sum over the degrees of the males is equal to the sum over the degrees</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:14,680 –&gt; 00:08:16,760<br>of the females.</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:16,760 –&gt; 00:08:20,800<br>Because every time there’s a liaison, it involves one male, one female.</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:20,800 –&gt; 00:08:24,879<br>All right, now let’s just do a little bit of elementary arithmetic.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:24,879 –&gt; 00:08:31,040<br>I’m going to divide both sides of this equality by the size of the male population by the</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:31,040 –&gt; 00:08:32,600<br>number of men.</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:32,600 –&gt; 00:08:35,240<br>And if I do that, I get this formula.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:35,240 –&gt; 00:08:40,159<br>The left hand side is the number of, is the sum of the degrees of men divided by the</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:40,159 –&gt; 00:08:42,159<br>size of the M population.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:42,159 –&gt; 00:08:43,519<br>And here I’m doing a little trick.</p>
<p>138<br>00:08:43,519 –&gt; 00:08:45,840<br>Notice that the F’s cancel out.</p>
<p>139<br>00:08:45,840 –&gt; 00:08:51,560<br>But I’ve expressed this sum of the female degrees divided by M as the sum of the female</p>
<p>140<br>00:08:51,560 –&gt; 00:08:58,000<br>degrees divided by F times this factor F over M, which is the ratio of the populations</p>
<p>141<br>00:08:58,000 –&gt; 00:08:59,560<br>of women to men.</p>
<p>142<br>00:08:59,560 –&gt; 00:09:04,639<br>Now, the reason I’m doing this is that if you look at this thing on the left, this is the</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:04,639 –&gt; 00:09:07,240<br>average degree of the men.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:07,240 –&gt; 00:09:11,800<br>This is the sum of all the degrees divided by the number of men.</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:11,799 –&gt; 00:09:16,000<br>So it’s the average number of partners that men have.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:16,000 –&gt; 00:09:22,199<br>And likewise, now you can recognize over here that I’ve got the average number of partners</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:22,199 –&gt; 00:09:24,839<br>that each woman has.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:24,839 –&gt; 00:09:30,719<br>And what we’ve just figured out then is that there’s a fixed relationship between the average</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:30,719 –&gt; 00:09:35,839<br>number of partners of men, the average degree of the M vertices, and the average degree</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:35,840 –&gt; 00:09:37,519<br>of the F vertices.</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:37,519 –&gt; 00:09:43,519<br>And these two average degrees, these average numbers of partners, is simply related by the</p>
<p>152<br>00:09:43,519 –&gt; 00:09:45,960<br>ratio of the populations.</p>
<p>153<br>00:09:45,960 –&gt; 00:09:51,680<br>The average men degree is the female population divided by the M population times the average</p>
<p>154<br>00:09:51,680 –&gt; 00:09:54,080<br>degree of the females.</p>
<p>155<br>00:09:54,080 –&gt; 00:10:03,639<br>Now, what that tells us is that these wild figures of twice as many and 30 percent more</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:03,639 –&gt; 00:10:08,199<br>and so on are completely absurd because we know a lot about the ratio of females to</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:08,199 –&gt; 00:10:09,199<br>males in the population.</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:09,199 –&gt; 00:10:15,039<br>As a matter of fact, in the U.S. overall, there are slightly more women than men.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:15,039 –&gt; 00:10:20,840<br>There’s 1.035 women for each man in the U.S. population.</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:20,840 –&gt; 00:10:25,919<br>And that tells us then that if you survey the population of all the men and women in the</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:25,919 –&gt; 00:10:32,840<br>country, you would discover that the men looked 3.5 percent more, had 3.5 percent more</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:32,840 –&gt; 00:10:37,240<br>partners than women per man.</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:37,240 –&gt; 00:10:41,759<br>But this has nothing to do with their behavior or promiscuity or lack of it.</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:41,759 –&gt; 00:10:48,639<br>It’s simply a reflection of the ratio of the populations.</p>
<p>165<br>00:10:48,639 –&gt; 00:10:54,440<br>Which gets us to the question of where do these crazy numbers come from and the answer</p>
<p>166<br>00:10:54,440 –&gt; 00:10:59,000<br>seems to be that people are lying.</p>
<p>167<br>00:10:59,000 –&gt; 00:11:02,759<br>One explanation would be that men exaggerate their number of partners and women understate</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:02,759 –&gt; 00:11:03,960<br>their number of partners.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:03,960 –&gt; 00:11:10,960<br>But the truth is that nobody knows exactly why we get these consistently false numbers,</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:10,960 –&gt; 00:11:14,879<br>but we do get them consistently in one survey after another.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:14,879 –&gt; 00:11:17,559<br>You will no longer be fooled by such nonsense.</p>
