                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:07,500<br>Graph coloring is the abstract version of a problem that arises from a bunch of conflict scheduling</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:07,500 –&gt; 00:00:08,500<br>situations.</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:08,500 –&gt; 00:00:12,660<br>So let’s look at an example first and then define the problem.</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:12,660 –&gt; 00:00:18,780<br>So let’s think about a bunch of aircraft that have to be scheduled on the ground, jet</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:18,780 –&gt; 00:00:20,500<br>ports or gates.</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:20,500 –&gt; 00:00:24,740<br>Now if two flights are on the ground at the same time, they need to be assigned to different</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:24,740 –&gt; 00:00:27,660<br>gates since the gate serves one airplane.</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:27,660 –&gt; 00:00:32,700<br>And what we’d like to do is try to figure out how many different gates do we need to be</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:32,700 –&gt; 00:00:36,780<br>able to service all the planes that might be on the ground.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:36,780 –&gt; 00:00:38,060<br>How many gates are needed?</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:38,060 –&gt; 00:00:40,100<br>So let’s look at a sample schedule.</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:40,100 –&gt; 00:00:44,000<br>There are six flights here, number 122, 145 through 99.</p>
<p>13<br>00:00:44,000 –&gt; 00:00:49,960<br>And the horizontal bar is, say, times during the day.</p>
<p>14<br>00:00:49,960 –&gt; 00:00:56,719<br>And this blue block indicates that flight 122 is on the ground from, let’s say, 3am to</p>
<p>15<br>00:00:56,719 –&gt; 00:01:02,879<br>7am and flight 145 is on the ground at a completely different, disjoint time interval.</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:02,879 –&gt; 00:01:03,879<br>So 67.</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:03,879 –&gt; 00:01:10,280<br>257 is on the ground from midnight until about 6am, it does overlap with 122 and so on.</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:10,280 –&gt; 00:01:16,480<br>So this is the information we have and what we’re trying to figure out is how many gates do</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:16,480 –&gt; 00:01:17,480<br>we need.</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:17,480 –&gt; 00:01:23,759<br>Well, it’s easy to see here that the worst case, if you just think of this vertical green</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:23,760 –&gt; 00:01:30,160<br>line sliding across the bar and you look at the maximum number of blue intervals that</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:30,160 –&gt; 00:01:33,080<br>the green line ever crosses, it’s three.</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:33,080 –&gt; 00:01:38,040<br>The largest number of planes that are on the gate at any given moment is three, which</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:38,040 –&gt; 00:01:40,760<br>means we can get by with three gates.</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:40,760 –&gt; 00:01:42,760<br>So we have to cope with that conflict.</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:42,760 –&gt; 00:01:49,240<br>So abstractly, what we’re going to do is assign each aircraft to be a vertex of a graph.</p>
<p>27<br>00:01:49,239 –&gt; 00:01:55,439<br>And we’re going to put an edge in to indicate not compatibility, but conflict.</p>
<p>28<br>00:01:55,439 –&gt; 00:01:59,560<br>Compatibility was what we were looking at previously with our examples of matching.</p>
<p>29<br>00:01:59,560 –&gt; 00:02:05,079<br>Now this line means that 306 and 145 are on the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:05,079 –&gt; 00:02:06,199<br>They conflict.</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:06,199 –&gt; 00:02:10,479<br>They need the same gate and we have to serve them with different gates.</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:10,479 –&gt; 00:02:14,479<br>And likewise, 99 and 145 are on the ground, 306 and 99.</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:14,479 –&gt; 00:02:18,799<br>This was the three flights that were on the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:18,799 –&gt; 00:02:23,599<br>And then if I fill in the graph with all the other vertices and draw an edge when two</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:23,599 –&gt; 00:02:27,479<br>flights are on the ground at the same time, I wind up with this little graph.</p>
<p>36<br>00:02:27,479 –&gt; 00:02:28,479<br>Okay.</p>
<p>37<br>00:02:28,479 –&gt; 00:02:33,519<br>Now we can talk abstractly about the coloring problem, which is let’s assign colors to the</p>
<p>38<br>00:02:33,519 –&gt; 00:02:42,159<br>vertices in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.</p>
<p>39<br>00:02:42,159 –&gt; 00:02:45,199<br>The adjacent vertices should have different colors.</p>
<p>40<br>00:02:45,199 –&gt; 00:02:51,280<br>And it should be clear from the description of how we derive this graph from the airline</p>
<p>41<br>00:02:51,280 –&gt; 00:02:58,439<br>aircraft schedules that the minimum number of distinct colors needed to color the graph</p>
<p>42<br>00:02:58,439 –&gt; 00:03:03,479<br>corresponds to the minimum number of gates needed to serve the aircraft.</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:03,479 –&gt; 00:03:04,919<br>So let’s try coloring this graph.</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:04,919 –&gt; 00:03:11,280<br>I’ll start with coloring for 257 red and 122 yellow and 99 green.</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:11,280 –&gt; 00:03:14,599<br>There’s no loss of generality here because these are the three that are on the ground at</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:14,599 –&gt; 00:03:18,120<br>the same time reflected by the fact that they’re in a triangle.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:18,120 –&gt; 00:03:21,400<br>And I’m going to have to use three different colors since each one is adjacent to the other</p>
<p>48<br>00:03:21,400 –&gt; 00:03:22,400<br>two.</p>
<p>49<br>00:03:22,400 –&gt; 00:03:23,400<br>Okay.</p>
<p>50<br>00:03:23,400 –&gt; 00:03:24,400<br>What next?</p>
<p>51<br>00:03:24,400 –&gt; 00:03:25,400<br>Well, let’s color 145 yellow.</p>
<p>52<br>00:03:25,400 –&gt; 00:03:30,439<br>I might as well reuse it since it’s not adjacent to a yellow vertex.</p>
<p>53<br>00:03:30,439 –&gt; 00:03:34,560<br>And then here I’ve got another triangle.</p>
<p>54<br>00:03:34,560 –&gt; 00:03:38,800<br>So if I’m not going to use an extra color, the sensible thing to do would be to color that</p>
<p>55<br>00:03:38,800 –&gt; 00:03:39,800<br>red.</p>
<p>56<br>00:03:39,800 –&gt; 00:03:40,800<br>But oops, I didn’t do that.</p>
<p>57<br>00:03:40,800 –&gt; 00:03:44,960<br>And here there’s another triangle, I guess, that allows me to color.</p>
<p>58<br>00:03:44,960 –&gt; 00:03:48,439<br>And then I color this black because here I’m stuck.</p>
<p>59<br>00:03:48,439 –&gt; 00:03:53,760<br>I’m adjacent to both a yellow, a black and a green vertex.</p>
<p>60<br>00:03:53,760 –&gt; 00:03:56,439<br>So I have to come up with a fourth color.</p>
<p>61<br>00:03:56,439 –&gt; 00:03:57,439<br>All right.</p>
<p>62<br>00:03:57,439 –&gt; 00:03:58,439<br>We did with four colors.</p>
<p>63<br>00:03:58,439 –&gt; 00:04:03,720<br>It means that we could have gotten away with four gates and the colors tell us which aircraft</p>
<p>64<br>00:04:03,720 –&gt; 00:04:04,920<br>to assign to which gates.</p>
<p>65<br>00:04:04,920 –&gt; 00:04:10,439<br>So 257 and 67 can both be assigned to the red gate because they are not on the ground</p>
<p>66<br>00:04:10,439 –&gt; 00:04:11,879<br>at the same time.</p>
<p>67<br>00:04:11,879 –&gt; 00:04:13,520<br>There’s no edge between them.</p>
<p>68<br>00:04:13,520 –&gt; 00:04:17,600<br>122 and 145 can be assigned to yellow gate and so on.</p>
<p>69<br>00:04:17,600 –&gt; 00:04:20,360<br>Now this was not the smartest way to color.</p>
<p>70<br>00:04:20,360 –&gt; 00:04:21,879<br>A better coloring is shown here.</p>
<p>71<br>00:04:21,879 –&gt; 00:04:25,439<br>You can check that every two adjacent vertices have different colors.</p>
<p>72<br>00:04:25,439 –&gt; 00:04:30,360<br>And now I’ve done it with only three colors, red, yellow and green.</p>
<p>73<br>00:04:30,360 –&gt; 00:04:34,319<br>So now there are three gates and I get a better schedule.</p>
<p>74<br>00:04:34,319 –&gt; 00:04:39,000<br>Another example of this kind of conflict problem comes up with scheduling final exams.</p>
<p>75<br>00:04:39,000 –&gt; 00:04:43,759<br>Two subjects conflict if a student is taking both.</p>
<p>76<br>00:04:43,759 –&gt; 00:04:47,800<br>Because if a student is taking both, I can’t have the final exams at the same time.</p>
<p>77<br>00:04:47,800 –&gt; 00:04:53,759<br>And so I need to assign different time slots during exam period to subjects that overlap</p>
<p>78<br>00:04:53,759 –&gt; 00:04:55,759<br>that have a student in common.</p>
<p>79<br>00:04:55,759 –&gt; 00:05:02,079<br>And then the question is given this data about which pairs of subjects have a student in</p>
<p>80<br>00:05:02,079 –&gt; 00:05:06,680<br>common, we want to know how short an exam period can we get away with.</p>
<p>81<br>00:05:06,680 –&gt; 00:05:10,600<br>Again, it becomes a simple graph model and a coloring problem.</p>
<p>82<br>00:05:10,600 –&gt; 00:05:13,879<br>So here we’ve drawn a graph with some sample subjects.</p>
<p>83<br>00:05:13,879 –&gt; 00:05:17,959<br>6042 and 1802 have a student in common.</p>
<p>84<br>00:05:17,959 –&gt; 00:05:19,400<br>That’s what that edge means.</p>
<p>85<br>00:05:19,400 –&gt; 00:05:23,000<br>They need to have final exam scheduled at different times.</p>
<p>86<br>00:05:23,000 –&gt; 00:05:27,160<br>Likewise, 802 and 6042 have a student in common.</p>
<p>87<br>00:05:27,160 –&gt; 00:05:29,480<br>So they need to be scheduled at different times.</p>
<p>88<br>00:05:29,480 –&gt; 00:05:37,319<br>On the other hand, 6042 and 1802, sorry, what are some two that are not adjacent?</p>
<p>89<br>00:05:37,319 –&gt; 00:05:44,680<br>3091 and 1802 have no edge between them, which means that they can be scheduled at the same</p>
<p>90<br>00:05:44,680 –&gt; 00:05:45,680<br>time.</p>
<p>91<br>00:05:45,680 –&gt; 00:05:51,640<br>There’s no student who’s taking both 3091 and 1802, at least according to the data in this</p>
<p>92<br>00:05:51,640 –&gt; 00:05:52,640<br>graph.</p>
<p>93<br>00:05:52,640 –&gt; 00:05:54,040<br>So let’s try coloring it.</p>
<p>94<br>00:05:54,040 –&gt; 00:05:55,800<br>And again, there’s a triangle.</p>
<p>95<br>00:05:55,800 –&gt; 00:05:59,439<br>I’m going to have to use three different colors for a triangle.</p>
<p>96<br>00:05:59,439 –&gt; 00:06:01,600<br>And here’s another triangle.</p>
<p>97<br>00:06:01,600 –&gt; 00:06:06,879<br>And to be economical, let’s just reuse green.</p>
<p>98<br>00:06:06,879 –&gt; 00:06:13,040<br>Now here I’ve got another vertex that’s adjacent to three different color vertices.</p>
<p>99<br>00:06:13,040 –&gt; 00:06:15,879<br>And so it’s going to have to be colored with a fourth color.</p>
<p>100<br>00:06:15,879 –&gt; 00:06:18,480<br>This time it turns out that the four colors are best possible.</p>
<p>101<br>00:06:18,480 –&gt; 00:06:19,639<br>You can check that.</p>
<p>102<br>00:06:19,639 –&gt; 00:06:27,480<br>And it corresponds to a schedule in which the 6042 is scheduled on Monday morning at 9.</p>
<p>103<br>00:06:27,480 –&gt; 00:06:31,800<br>And 6.001 is scheduled on Monday at 1.</p>
<p>104<br>00:06:31,800 –&gt; 00:06:36,319<br>But 802 and 3091 can both be scheduled for Tuesday 9 am.</p>
<p>105<br>00:06:36,319 –&gt; 00:06:41,960<br>And finally, 1802 is scheduled on Tuesday at 1 pm.</p>
<p>106<br>00:06:41,960 –&gt; 00:06:48,560<br>OK, so this kind of a conflict modeling situation comes up all the time.</p>
<p>107<br>00:06:48,560 –&gt; 00:06:52,800<br>Another place where you get these kind of compatibility graphs or incompatibility graphs</p>
<p>108<br>00:06:52,800 –&gt; 00:06:56,000<br>that you want to color would be if you were running a zoo.</p>
<p>109<br>00:06:56,000 –&gt; 00:07:01,360<br>And you had to have separate habitats for certain kinds of species of animals that you don’t</p>
<p>110<br>00:07:01,360 –&gt; 00:07:03,360<br>want to mix together.</p>
<p>111<br>00:07:03,360 –&gt; 00:07:04,639<br>Big fish eat little fish.</p>
<p>112<br>00:07:04,639 –&gt; 00:07:06,959<br>It’s a truism in the aquarium world.</p>
<p>113<br>00:07:06,959 –&gt; 00:07:10,879<br>And so you need to keep big fish separate from little fish.</p>
<p>114<br>00:07:10,879 –&gt; 00:07:15,360<br>And you don’t want the tigers living together with the chimpanzees.</p>
<p>115<br>00:07:15,360 –&gt; 00:07:20,160<br>So we could, again, model this problem as how many cages do we need?</p>
<p>116<br>00:07:20,160 –&gt; 00:07:25,480<br>We create a vertex for each species and put an arrow between an edge between two species</p>
<p>117<br>00:07:25,480 –&gt; 00:07:30,560<br>that mustn’t share a habitat or share a cage.</p>
<p>118<br>00:07:30,560 –&gt; 00:07:35,080<br>Another one would be assigning different frequencies to radio stations.</p>
<p>119<br>00:07:35,080 –&gt; 00:07:40,480<br>And again, if two radio stations are close to each other, they will interfere.</p>
<p>120<br>00:07:40,480 –&gt; 00:07:44,120<br>And so they have to be assigned to different colors or different frequencies.</p>
<p>121<br>00:07:44,120 –&gt; 00:07:49,800<br>So now we would be using radio stations as vertices and radio stations that were near</p>
<p>122<br>00:07:49,800 –&gt; 00:07:54,360<br>enough to interfere with each other would get connected by an edge indicating that they</p>
<p>123<br>00:07:54,360 –&gt; 00:07:57,960<br>needed to be assigned different color frequencies.</p>
<p>124<br>00:07:57,960 –&gt; 00:08:03,480<br>And one of the classic ones is literally to color a map if you were trying to take, say,</p>
<p>125<br>00:08:03,480 –&gt; 00:08:10,520<br>a map of the US and assign colors to it in such a way that you never had two states that</p>
<p>126<br>00:08:10,520 –&gt; 00:08:13,639<br>shared a border with the same color.</p>
<p>127<br>00:08:13,639 –&gt; 00:08:17,240<br>And this is an illustration of doing it with four colors.</p>
<p>128<br>00:08:17,240 –&gt; 00:08:21,040<br>The question is if I give you some kind of a planar map like this, what’s the minimum</p>
<p>129<br>00:08:21,040 –&gt; 00:08:22,639<br>number of colors that will work?</p>
<p>130<br>00:08:22,639 –&gt; 00:08:29,079<br>Now you’re allowed to have two vertices with the two countries, rather share the color</p>
<p>131<br>00:08:29,079 –&gt; 00:08:33,799<br>if they only share a meat at one point.</p>
<p>132<br>00:08:33,799 –&gt; 00:08:39,439<br>But if they have a positive length boundary, they have to be different colors.</p>
<p>133<br>00:08:39,439 –&gt; 00:08:48,720<br>Okay, the way that this turns into a vertex coloring problem is if you take a planar graph</p>
<p>134<br>00:08:48,720 –&gt; 00:08:50,919<br>like this, here’s just an arbitrary one.</p>
<p>135<br>00:08:50,919 –&gt; 00:08:55,399<br>What I can do is I’m interested in coloring the regions, the countries with different colors,</p>
<p>136<br>00:08:55,399 –&gt; 00:08:58,159<br>but I’ll just replace each region by a vertex.</p>
<p>137<br>00:08:58,159 –&gt; 00:09:00,879<br>So I’m going to stick a vertex in the middle of each of the regions.</p>
<p>138<br>00:09:00,879 –&gt; 00:09:03,719<br>Notice there’s an outer region here too that gets a vertex.</p>
<p>139<br>00:09:03,719 –&gt; 00:09:07,759<br>So one, two, three, four, five, six regions for six vertices.</p>
<p>140<br>00:09:07,759 –&gt; 00:09:15,039<br>And then I’ll simply connect two vertices when there is a positive length edge that their</p>
<p>141<br>00:09:15,039 –&gt; 00:09:16,399<br>regions share.</p>
<p>142<br>00:09:16,399 –&gt; 00:09:20,559<br>So there’s that vertex, that edge corresponds to the fact that there’s this boundary that’s</p>
<p>143<br>00:09:20,559 –&gt; 00:09:24,319<br>shared between this region and this region.</p>
<p>144<br>00:09:24,319 –&gt; 00:09:31,120<br>If you look at this same triangular shaped region, it has a boundary with the outside region.</p>
<p>145<br>00:09:31,120 –&gt; 00:09:35,279<br>So there’s going to be an edge from here to the vertex that represents the outside.</p>
<p>146<br>00:09:35,279 –&gt; 00:09:37,439<br>And there’s the rest of the edges.</p>
<p>147<br>00:09:37,439 –&gt; 00:09:43,600<br>And edge appears when between two regions that share a boundary.</p>
<p>148<br>00:09:43,600 –&gt; 00:09:49,639<br>Now the question is coloring the countries corresponds to coloring the vertices.</p>
<p>149<br>00:09:49,639 –&gt; 00:09:53,320<br>And we’d like to color the graph with as few colors as possible.</p>
<p>150<br>00:09:53,320 –&gt; 00:09:58,680<br>Well, a famous result that was proved in the seven days is that every planar graph is</p>
<p>151<br>00:09:58,680 –&gt; 00:10:01,200<br>in fact for colorable.</p>
<p>152<br>00:10:01,200 –&gt; 00:10:05,000<br>Now this was first proved, claimed to be proved in the 1850s, but in fact the published</p>
<p>153<br>00:10:05,000 –&gt; 00:10:09,720<br>proof was wrong, it sat around in the journal literature for a decade before somebody found</p>
<p>154<br>00:10:09,720 –&gt; 00:10:10,720<br>a bug.</p>
<p>155<br>00:10:11,120 –&gt; 00:10:13,680<br>And that is to say that the proof was wrong, not the result.</p>
<p>156<br>00:10:13,680 –&gt; 00:10:18,759<br>There was a big hole in the proof that that had not been adequately justified.</p>
<p>157<br>00:10:18,759 –&gt; 00:10:23,519<br>The proof did give a correct argument for five coloring and the four color problem was</p>
<p>158<br>00:10:23,519 –&gt; 00:10:26,080<br>opened for over a hundred years.</p>
<p>159<br>00:10:26,080 –&gt; 00:10:35,720<br>Then in the 1970s two mathematicians came up with a proof of the four color theorem that</p>
<p>160<br>00:10:35,720 –&gt; 00:10:41,680<br>was very controversial because a lot of their proof required a computer program to crank</p>
<p>161<br>00:10:41,680 –&gt; 00:10:46,879<br>through several thousand sample graphs that needed to be verified for four colorability.</p>
<p>162<br>00:10:46,879 –&gt; 00:10:52,360<br>They had an argument that showed that there could only be a few thousand counter examples</p>
<p>163<br>00:10:52,360 –&gt; 00:10:56,000<br>if there was any graph that couldn’t be four colored.</p>
<p>164<br>00:10:56,000 –&gt; 00:11:00,600<br>It would be one of these several thousand graphs and then they went to work on coloring</p>
<p>165<br>00:11:00,600 –&gt; 00:11:05,080<br>these several thousand graphs which were generated with the age of a computer and then</p>
<p>166<br>00:11:05,080 –&gt; 00:11:08,480<br>colored with the age of a computer and also by hand.</p>
<p>167<br>00:11:08,480 –&gt; 00:11:13,279<br>This did not make the mathematical community happy because a proof like that is essentially</p>
<p>168<br>00:11:13,279 –&gt; 00:11:15,120<br>uncheckable.</p>
<p>169<br>00:11:15,120 –&gt; 00:11:20,279<br>A much improved version was developed in the 1990s, but it still requires in the end a</p>
<p>170<br>00:11:20,279 –&gt; 00:11:25,279<br>computer program to generate about 600 maps and verify their colorability.</p>
<p>171<br>00:11:25,279 –&gt; 00:11:30,360<br>So it remains to find a proof of the four color theorem that you could say is humanly</p>
<p>172<br>00:11:30,360 –&gt; 00:11:33,399<br>comprehensible without the age of a computer.</p>
<p>173<br>00:11:33,399 –&gt; 00:11:41,720<br>But there’s no longer any doubt really about this theorem in the mathematical community.</p>
<p>174<br>00:11:41,720 –&gt; 00:11:47,039<br>In general, if I take an arbitrary graph and I ask what’s the minimum number of colors</p>
<p>175<br>00:11:47,039 –&gt; 00:11:50,800<br>to color it, that’s called the chromatic number of the graph.</p>
<p>176<br>00:11:50,800 –&gt; 00:11:56,440<br>So chi of g is the minimum number of colors to color g and let’s look at some chi’s for</p>
<p>177<br>00:11:56,440 –&gt; 00:11:58,279<br>different kinds of graphs.</p>
<p>178<br>00:11:58,279 –&gt; 00:12:03,159<br>So here we have a simple cycle of length four and it’s obvious that that can be colored</p>
<p>179<br>00:12:03,159 –&gt; 00:12:04,600<br>with two colors.</p>
<p>180<br>00:12:04,600 –&gt; 00:12:06,360<br>Just alternate the colors.</p>
<p>181<br>00:12:06,360 –&gt; 00:12:13,759<br>On the other hand, so what and if that generalizes, by the way, to any even length cycle, the</p>
<p>182<br>00:12:13,759 –&gt; 00:12:19,360<br>chromatic number of an even length cycle is simply two, you color the vertices alternately.</p>
<p>183<br>00:12:19,360 –&gt; 00:12:24,879<br>On the other hand, if the cycle is of odd length, you’re going to need a third color.</p>
<p>184<br>00:12:24,879 –&gt; 00:12:27,919<br>There’s no way around it because even if you try to get by with two colors, then your</p>
<p>185<br>00:12:27,919 –&gt; 00:12:29,639<br>color things alternately.</p>
<p>186<br>00:12:29,639 –&gt; 00:12:34,199<br>And then when you wrap around, you discover that you can’t alternately color.</p>
<p>187<br>00:12:34,199 –&gt; 00:12:37,439<br>You’re going to need a third color in order to avoid a clash.</p>
<p>188<br>00:12:37,439 –&gt; 00:12:45,120<br>So in general, the chromatic number of an odd length cycle is three.</p>
<p>189<br>00:12:45,120 –&gt; 00:12:49,719<br>The complete graph on five vertices is shown here.</p>
<p>190<br>00:12:49,719 –&gt; 00:12:55,799<br>This is a five vertex graph in which every vertex is adjacent to the other four.</p>
<p>191<br>00:12:55,799 –&gt; 00:13:01,159<br>And since every vertex is adjacent to the other four, you’re going to need five colors.</p>
<p>192<br>00:13:01,159 –&gt; 00:13:02,159<br>You can’t do any better.</p>
<p>193<br>00:13:02,159 –&gt; 00:13:05,519<br>They have to all have different colors.</p>
<p>194<br>00:13:05,519 –&gt; 00:13:11,000<br>And so the chromatic number of the complete graph on n vertices where every vertex is adjacent</p>
<p>195<br>00:13:11,000 –&gt; 00:13:15,959<br>to the other n minus one is n.</p>
<p>196<br>00:13:15,959 –&gt; 00:13:21,519<br>Another simple example that comes up is if I take the cycle and I put an axis, an axle</p>
<p>197<br>00:13:21,519 –&gt; 00:13:32,360<br>in the middle, call it a wheel then, a wheel with a cycle of length five around the outside,</p>
<p>198<br>00:13:32,360 –&gt; 00:13:36,240<br>a perimeter of length five is called W five.</p>
<p>199<br>00:13:36,240 –&gt; 00:13:40,240<br>And we can color it with four colors.</p>
<p>200<br>00:13:40,240 –&gt; 00:13:47,639<br>And in general, the argument for the chromatic number for an odd length wheel is four is that</p>
<p>201<br>00:13:47,639 –&gt; 00:13:50,759<br>I know I’m going to need three colors to color the rim.</p>
<p>202<br>00:13:50,759 –&gt; 00:13:55,000<br>And since the axle is adjacent to everything on the rim, I’m going to need a fourth color</p>
<p>203<br>00:13:55,000 –&gt; 00:13:56,000<br>for it.</p>
<p>204<br>00:13:56,000 –&gt; 00:14:02,600<br>On the other hand, again, if the perimeter is even, then I can get by with three colors.</p>
<p>205<br>00:14:02,600 –&gt; 00:14:07,720<br>One more remark about chromatic numbers is there’s an easy argument that shows that if</p>
<p>206<br>00:14:07,720 –&gt; 00:14:17,159<br>you have a graph, every one of whose vertices is at most degree k, there are at most k other</p>
<p>207<br>00:14:17,159 –&gt; 00:14:22,360<br>vertices adjacent to any given vertex, then that implies that the graph is k plus one</p>
<p>208<br>00:14:22,360 –&gt; 00:14:23,360<br>colorable.</p>
<p>209<br>00:14:23,360 –&gt; 00:14:25,759<br>And the proof is really constructive and trivial.</p>
<p>210<br>00:14:25,759 –&gt; 00:14:30,839<br>Basically, you just start coloring the vertices any way you like.</p>
<p>211<br>00:14:30,839 –&gt; 00:14:34,879<br>Subject to the constraint that when you color a vertex, it’s supposed to not be the same</p>
<p>212<br>00:14:34,879 –&gt; 00:14:37,439<br>color as any of the vertices around it.</p>
<p>213<br>00:14:37,439 –&gt; 00:14:43,399<br>But that’s easy to do because when it’s time to color some vertex, even if all the vertices</p>
<p>214<br>00:14:43,399 –&gt; 00:14:45,840<br>around that are colored, there’s only k of them.</p>
<p>215<br>00:14:45,840 –&gt; 00:14:50,840<br>And so I will always be able to find a k plus first color to assign it without and get</p>
<p>216<br>00:14:50,840 –&gt; 00:14:52,759<br>a satisfactory coloring.</p>
<p>217<br>00:14:52,759 –&gt; 00:14:57,360<br>So I can get by with k plus one colors.</p>
<p>218<br>00:14:57,360 –&gt; 00:15:02,720<br>Now the general setup with colorability is that to check whether a graph is two colorable</p>
<p>219<br>00:15:02,720 –&gt; 00:15:04,679<br>is actually very easy.</p>
<p>220<br>00:15:04,679 –&gt; 00:15:11,159<br>And we may talk about that in some class problems.</p>
<p>221<br>00:15:11,159 –&gt; 00:15:15,519<br>But three colorability dramatically changes.</p>
<p>222<br>00:15:15,519 –&gt; 00:15:19,240<br>We’re back in the realm of NP-complete problems.</p>
<p>223<br>00:15:19,240 –&gt; 00:15:25,079<br>In fact, a result of a student of mine almost 40 years ago was that even if a graph is</p>
<p>224<br>00:15:25,079 –&gt; 00:15:29,799<br>planar, where you know it can definitely be colored with four colors, determining whether</p>
<p>225<br>00:15:29,799 –&gt; 00:15:35,559<br>or not it can be colored with three colors is as hard as satisfiability.</p>
<p>226<br>00:15:35,559 –&gt; 00:15:38,720<br>And it is in fact an NP-complete problem.</p>
<p>227<br>00:15:38,720 –&gt; 00:15:46,680<br>In fact, a proof of how you reduce satisfiability to colorability appears in a problem in the</p>
<p>228<br>00:15:46,680 –&gt; 00:15:51,800<br>text, which we may assign as a problem, set problem.</p>
<p>229<br>00:15:51,800 –&gt; 00:15:56,800<br>So in general, finding k of g is hard.</p>
<p>230<br>00:15:56,800 –&gt; 00:16:03,560<br>Even for three colors, now it’s not any worse, again, from a theoretical point of view,</p>
<p>231<br>00:16:03,559 –&gt; 00:16:09,559<br>or checking what k of g is, even if it’s a very large number, or the pragmatically</p>
<p>232<br>00:16:09,559 –&gt; 00:16:14,759<br>three color will be easier to check than n colorability.</p>
<p>233<br>00:16:14,759 –&gt; 00:16:17,959<br>And that is our story about colorability.</p>
