                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:06,839<br>So now we start on a unit of about a half a dozen lectures on probability theory, which most</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:06,839 –&gt; 00:00:11,560<br>students have been exposed to to some degree in high school. We’ll be taking a more thorough</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:11,560 –&gt; 00:00:18,699<br>and theoretical look at the subject in our six lectures. But before we begin, let’s give</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:18,699 –&gt; 00:00:23,600<br>a little pitch for the significance of it. There’s been extensive debate among the faculty</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:23,600 –&gt; 00:00:29,560<br>that probability theory belongs right up there with physics and chemistry and math as something</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:29,559 –&gt; 00:00:34,280<br>that should be a fundamental requirement for all students to know. It plays an absolutely</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:34,280 –&gt; 00:00:41,259<br>fundamental role in the hard sciences and the social sciences and engineering that pervades</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:41,259 –&gt; 00:00:47,640<br>all those subjects. And it’s hard to imagine somebody legitimately being called fully educated</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:47,640 –&gt; 00:00:50,119<br>if they don’t understand the basics of probability theory.</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:50,119 –&gt; 00:00:55,519<br>Now, historically, probability theory starts off in a somewhat disreputable way in the</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:55,520 –&gt; 00:01:03,920<br>16th and early 17th centuries or 17th and early 18th centuries with the analysis of gambling.</p>
<p>12<br>00:01:03,920 –&gt; 00:01:10,079<br>But then it goes on to be the basis for the insurance industry and underwriting, predicting</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:10,079 –&gt; 00:01:14,900<br>life expectancy so that you could understand what kind of premiums to charge. And then it</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:14,900 –&gt; 00:01:21,560<br>goes on to allow the interpretation of noisy data with errors in it and the degree to which</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:21,560 –&gt; 00:01:29,719<br>it confirms scientific and social science hypotheses. But true to the historical basis, let’s begin</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:29,719 –&gt; 00:01:36,400<br>with an example from gambling that illustrates the first idea of probability and then we’re going</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:36,400 –&gt; 00:01:42,680<br>to be working up to a methodology for inventing probability models called the tree model. So let’s</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:42,680 –&gt; 00:01:49,820<br>begin with an example from poker. And I’d like to ask a question if I deal a hand of five cards in</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:49,819 –&gt; 00:01:56,779<br>poker, what’s the probability of getting exactly two jacks? So there are 13 ranks and there are four</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:56,779 –&gt; 00:02:02,139<br>kinds of jacks, space heart diamonds clubs. What’s the probability that among my five cards I’m going to</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:02,139 –&gt; 00:02:08,219<br>get two of them? Well, that’s really a counting problem because I’m going to ask first of all, how</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:08,219 –&gt; 00:02:13,979<br>many possible five card hands are? We can think of these as the outcomes of a random experiment of just</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:13,979 –&gt; 00:02:21,819<br>picking five cards. And there are 52 choose five five card hands in a 52 card deck. Then there are</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:22,539 –&gt; 00:02:29,419<br>four choose two ways of picking the suits for the two jacks that we have. And so the total number</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:29,419 –&gt; 00:02:37,179<br>of hands that have two jacks is simply four choose two times 52 minus four, the remaining 48 cards</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:37,180 –&gt; 00:02:43,659<br>choose the remaining three cards in the five card hand. And then what we would say is that the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:43,659 –&gt; 00:02:50,540<br>probability of two jacks is basically the number of hands with two jacks divided by the total number</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:50,540 –&gt; 00:02:57,580<br>of hands. Turns out to be about point oh four. And under this interpretation, basically what we’re</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:57,580 –&gt; 00:03:04,540<br>thinking of probability is telling us is what fraction of the time do I get what I want? What’s</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:04,539 –&gt; 00:03:09,979<br>the fraction of the time that I quote, when if winning consists of getting a pair of jacks? And by</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:09,979 –&gt; 00:03:17,500<br>symmetry and the fact that we think of one hand is likely to come up as another, this fraction</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:17,500 –&gt; 00:03:23,419<br>of hands that equal two jacks, it makes sense to think of that as that’s the probability that we’ll</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:23,419 –&gt; 00:03:28,620<br>get that hand. If we think of all the hands as being equally likely, we yank one out of the deck.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:28,700 –&gt; 00:03:33,980<br>The fraction of time that we would expect to get to jacks is this number about point oh four.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:36,060 –&gt; 00:03:41,740<br>So the general setup of probability, the first idea based on this illustration with a pair of jacks</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:41,740 –&gt; 00:03:46,379<br>is that we abstractly we have some set of, we have some random experiment that’s capable of</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:46,379 –&gt; 00:03:53,420<br>producing outcomes. These are mathematical black boxes called outcomes. Now a certain set of the</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:53,420 –&gt; 00:03:57,900<br>outcomes we will think of as an event that we’re interested in whether or not it happens. We could</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:57,900 –&gt; 00:04:04,939<br>think of it as the event of getting to jacks or the event of winning some game. Then we define the</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:04,939 –&gt; 00:04:12,379<br>probability of an event as simply the fraction of the outcomes in the event divided by the total</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:12,379 –&gt; 00:04:17,980<br>number of outcomes. Among all the outcomes, what fraction of outcomes are in the event and we</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:17,980 –&gt; 00:04:24,540<br>define that to be the probability of the event. That’s the first naive idea about probability theory</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:24,540 –&gt; 00:04:30,780<br>and it applies to a lot of cases but not always. So now let’s begin with an example which illustrates</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:30,780 –&gt; 00:04:36,060<br>why this first idea needs to be refined and it doesn’t really give us the kind of theory of</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:36,060 –&gt; 00:04:42,300<br>probability that we like. So let’s turn to a game that was really famous in the 1970s. An</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:42,300 –&gt; 00:04:49,020<br>enormously popular TV game hosted by a man named Monty Hall, the actual name of the TV show was</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:49,419 –&gt; 00:04:55,819<br>Let’s Make a Deal but we’ll refer to it as the Monty Hall game. And the way that this Let’s Make</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:55,819 –&gt; 00:05:02,299<br>a Deal show worked was roughly that there were three doors. This is an actual picture of the stage</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:02,299 –&gt; 00:05:10,779<br>set door one, door two, door three. And by the way, this game show still has a fan base. There’s a</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:10,779 –&gt; 00:05:16,779<br>website for it that you can look at and even 40 years later people are still caught up in the</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:16,779 –&gt; 00:05:22,459<br>dynamics of the game. So there are these three doors and the idea is that behind the doors they’re</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:22,459 –&gt; 00:05:28,939<br>going to have a prize behind one of them and some kind of booby prize often a goat held by a beautiful</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:28,939 –&gt; 00:05:33,979<br>woman holding a goat on a leash just to keep things visually interesting and that’s what you got</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:33,979 –&gt; 00:05:39,179<br>if you lost. And the contestants were going to somehow or other pick a door and hope that the</p>
<p>55<br>00:05:39,179 –&gt; 00:05:45,019<br>prize was behind it. There’s the picture of the staff, there’s Monty Hall and his and the woman</p>
<p>56<br>00:05:45,019 –&gt; 00:05:50,939<br>who was his assistant Carol Merrill her job was to pick doors to open and show them to contestants to</p>
<p>57<br>00:05:50,939 –&gt; 00:05:57,099<br>see what was behind them. Okay, so here are the rules for the Monty Hall game. The actual quiz show</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:57,099 –&gt; 00:06:03,500<br>had more flexible rules but for simplicity we’re going to define a nice simple precise and fixed set</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:03,500 –&gt; 00:06:09,180<br>of rules. The rules are that behind the three doors two of the doors are going to have goats</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:09,180 –&gt; 00:06:14,139<br>and one of the doors is going to have a prize behind it often the prize is something like an automobile</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:14,139 –&gt; 00:06:21,819<br>something really desirable. So we can assume that the the the staff on purpose will</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:22,219 –&gt; 00:06:27,099<br>place the prize at random behind the three doors because they don’t want anybody to have a guest</p>
<p>63<br>00:06:27,099 –&gt; 00:06:32,219<br>that some doors are more likely than others to have the prize and they’re not allowed to cheat.</p>
<p>64<br>00:06:32,219 –&gt; 00:06:36,300<br>That is once they’ve decided which door is going to have the prize it’s supposed to stay there</p>
<p>65<br>00:06:36,300 –&gt; 00:06:42,139<br>throughout the game. They can’t move it in response to the which door that the contestants picked that</p>
<p>66<br>00:06:42,139 –&gt; 00:06:49,180<br>would be cheating. Okay, next the contestant has given opportunity to pick one of the doors.</p>
<p>67<br>00:06:49,899 –&gt; 00:06:54,379<br>They’re all closed and it’s hard to understand how the contestant would make a choice but if the</p>
<p>68<br>00:06:54,379 –&gt; 00:07:00,860<br>contestant was worried about the the staff trying to out guess them on where to put the goat and where</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:00,860 –&gt; 00:07:05,259<br>to put the prize the contestant should just pick all the doors with equally likely with equally</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:05,259 –&gt; 00:07:10,300<br>likely hood then he can’t be beaten by they’re trying to out guess him he can only be beaten by if they</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:10,300 –&gt; 00:07:14,060<br>cheated him by moving the goat after he picked or moving the prize after he picked.</p>
<p>72<br>00:07:16,620 –&gt; 00:07:22,300<br>At this point once the contestant has picked the door let’s say he picks door two then</p>
<p>73<br>00:07:22,300 –&gt; 00:07:29,819<br>Monty instructs Carol to open a door with a goat behind it. So he’s going to choose an unpicked door</p>
<p>74<br>00:07:29,819 –&gt; 00:07:35,980<br>if the cut if the contestant has picked door two that means the door one and door three are</p>
<p>75<br>00:07:35,980 –&gt; 00:07:45,740<br>unpicked doors and Monty tells Carol open either door one or door three whichever one or perhaps both</p>
<p>76<br>00:07:45,740 –&gt; 00:07:51,420<br>have a goat behind them and so Carol is going to open one of those doors and show a goat and</p>
<p>77<br>00:07:51,420 –&gt; 00:07:56,060<br>everybody knows that they’re going to see a goat because that’s the way the game works and then at</p>
<p>78<br>00:07:56,060 –&gt; 00:08:01,580<br>this point in the contestant has seen that there’s a door that has a goat behind it and they’re</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:01,579 –&gt; 00:08:09,419<br>sitting on an unpicked door and there’s another unopened door that hasn’t been picked the contestant’s</p>
<p>80<br>00:08:09,419 –&gt; 00:08:15,500<br>job is to decide whether to stick with the door that they originally picked or switch to the</p>
<p>81<br>00:08:15,500 –&gt; 00:08:21,659<br>other unopened door so if they pick door two and Carol open door three they could stick with door two</p>
<p>82<br>00:08:21,659 –&gt; 00:08:26,939<br>or they could switch to the closed door one and hope that maybe one has the prize behind it.</p>
<p>83<br>00:08:27,660 –&gt; 00:08:35,019<br>Those are the rules of the game. Now the game got a lot of prominence in a magazine column</p>
<p>84<br>00:08:35,019 –&gt; 00:08:41,659<br>written by woman named Marilyn Vosavant the name of the magazine column is called Ask Marilyn and</p>
<p>85<br>00:08:41,659 –&gt; 00:08:49,259<br>she advertises herself as having the highest recorded IQ of all time some IQ of 200 and so she</p>
<p>86<br>00:08:50,220 –&gt; 00:08:58,860<br>runs a popular science in math column with various kinds of puzzles and she took up the analysis</p>
<p>87<br>00:08:58,860 –&gt; 00:09:05,819<br>of the Montyhole statistics and came to a conclusion and the conclusion caused a firestorm of response</p>
<p>88<br>00:09:05,819 –&gt; 00:09:13,500<br>letters from all sorts of readers even quite sophisticated PhD mathematicians who were arguing with</p>
<p>89<br>00:09:14,059 –&gt; 00:09:19,419<br>her conclusion about the way the game worked and the probability of winning according to how the</p>
<p>90<br>00:09:19,419 –&gt; 00:09:25,820<br>contestant behaved that debate basically came down to these two positions. Position one said that</p>
<p>91<br>00:09:25,820 –&gt; 00:09:31,179<br>sticking and switching were equally good it really didn’t matter what the contestant did whether</p>
<p>92<br>00:09:31,179 –&gt; 00:09:36,220<br>they stuck with the door that they originally picked or switched to the unpicked door after the</p>
<p>93<br>00:09:36,220 –&gt; 00:09:40,860<br>third door had been opened and that their likelihood of finding the prize was the same</p>
<p>94<br>00:09:41,820 –&gt; 00:09:47,899<br>and the other argument very emphatically said switching is much better you should really switch</p>
<p>95<br>00:09:48,379 –&gt; 00:09:57,019<br>no matter what and how can we resolve this question. Well the general method that we’re proposing</p>
<p>96<br>00:09:57,019 –&gt; 00:10:01,820<br>for dealing with problems like this where we’re really trying to figure out what is the proper</p>
<p>97<br>00:10:01,820 –&gt; 00:10:11,660<br>probability model is to draw a tree that shows step by step the progress of the process or experiment</p>
<p>98<br>00:10:11,660 –&gt; 00:10:18,379<br>that’s going to yield a random output and try to assign probabilities to each of the branches of</p>
<p>99<br>00:10:18,379 –&gt; 00:10:24,540<br>the tree as you go and use that as a guide for how to assign probabilities to outcomes. So let’s</p>
<p>100<br>00:10:24,539 –&gt; 00:10:31,740<br>begin first of all by finding out what the outcomes are. So and we’re going to be analyzing</p>
<p>101<br>00:10:32,299 –&gt; 00:10:39,419<br>the switch strategy so just for definiteness let’s suppose that the contestant adopts the strategy</p>
<p>102<br>00:10:39,419 –&gt; 00:10:45,259<br>that they pick a door, Carol opens a door then shows a goad and they’re going to switch to the</p>
<p>103<br>00:10:45,899 –&gt; 00:10:51,099<br>non-goat closed door that they did not originally pick. They’re going to switch to the other door</p>
<p>104<br>00:10:51,100 –&gt; 00:10:56,379<br>that they can switch to and we’re going to ask about what are the outcomes and consequences of</p>
<p>105<br>00:10:56,379 –&gt; 00:11:03,899<br>winning or losing if you adopt that strategy. Well the tree of possibilities goes like this the first</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:03,899 –&gt; 00:11:09,340<br>step in this process that we’ve described is that the staff picks a prize location to a door to put</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:09,340 –&gt; 00:11:15,740<br>the prize behind and so there are three possibilities they could put the prize behind door one, door two and</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:15,740 –&gt; 00:11:22,299<br>door three. Okay well let’s examine the possibility that they put the prize behind door one. So the</p>
<p>109<br>00:11:22,299 –&gt; 00:11:30,460<br>next stage is they pick a door and if they pick if the prize is behind one and they pick a door</p>
<p>110<br>00:11:30,460 –&gt; 00:11:37,340<br>again there are three possible doors that the contestant might pick contestant has no idea where the</p>
<p>111<br>00:11:37,340 –&gt; 00:11:44,860<br>prize is and so the contestant can choose either door one or door two or door three. At that point the</p>
<p>112<br>00:11:44,860 –&gt; 00:11:54,460<br>third event in this random process or experiment is that Carol opens a door that has a goad behind it.</p>
<p>113<br>00:11:55,180 –&gt; 00:12:03,019<br>So let’s examine those possibilities. So one possibility is that the prize is behind one and the</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:03,019 –&gt; 00:12:11,899<br>contestant picks door one initially. Well that means that Carol can open either door two or door three</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:11,899 –&gt; 00:12:17,259<br>in that circumstance because both of them have goats behind them. On the other hand if the</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:17,259 –&gt; 00:12:24,860<br>prize is at one and the contestant picks door two then Carol the two closed doors have one has the</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:24,860 –&gt; 00:12:30,139<br>prize one and the other doesn’t have the prize three. Carol has to open door three. Likewise if the</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:30,139 –&gt; 00:12:36,779<br>contestant picks door three when the prize is behind door one Carol has to open door two. So these</p>
<p>119<br>00:12:37,740 –&gt; 00:12:44,139<br>here she’s got a two-way branch she can choose to open either of the two goat doors two or three.</p>
<p>120<br>00:12:44,139 –&gt; 00:12:49,740<br>Here there’s only one on open door with a goat she’s got to open three there two. Okay and that</p>
<p>121<br>00:12:49,740 –&gt; 00:12:54,299<br>describes the outcomes of the experiment. That’s the the process of the experiment and these</p>
<p>122<br>00:12:54,299 –&gt; 00:12:59,579<br>nodes at the end these leaves of the tree describe the final outcomes on this branch.</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:00,860 –&gt; 00:13:05,819<br>Now if you look at the classification of these outcomes according to winning and losing</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:05,820 –&gt; 00:13:11,980<br>well we’re looking at the switch strategy. So if the prize was behind one and the contestant</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:11,980 –&gt; 00:13:18,700<br>picked door one initially then their strategy is to switch and they’re going to switch away from</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:19,420 –&gt; 00:13:26,140<br>the prize door. So whichever door Carol opened to reveal the goat two or three the contestant is</p>
<p>127<br>00:13:26,140 –&gt; 00:13:31,820<br>going to switch to the other one and they’re going to lose. So both of these outcomes count as losses</p>
<p>128<br>00:13:31,820 –&gt; 00:13:37,500<br>for the contestant. On the other hand if the contestant picked if the prize was behind door one and</p>
<p>129<br>00:13:37,500 –&gt; 00:13:45,100<br>the contestant picked door two then Carol opens the non-priced door three and the contestant switches</p>
<p>130<br>00:13:45,100 –&gt; 00:13:51,580<br>from two the only choice they have is to switch to one the prize door they win and this other case</p>
<p>131<br>00:13:51,580 –&gt; 00:13:56,780<br>is symmetric and that summarizes the wins and losses in this branch of the tree. Now of course</p>
<p>132<br>00:13:56,780 –&gt; 00:14:01,420<br>the rest of the tree is symmetric and so we don’t need to talk it through again this is just simply</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:01,419 –&gt; 00:14:06,699<br>the case where the prize is behind two the contestant has the same choices and Marilyn has the same</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:06,699 –&gt; 00:14:13,740<br>choices of which on open door to choose and likewise if the prize is behind three. So if we look at this</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:13,740 –&gt; 00:14:20,059<br>tree the tree is telling us that this is an experiment which we think of as having 12 outcomes</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:20,059 –&gt; 00:14:25,899<br>three in each of these may afford in each of these major branches. So there are 12 outcomes of this</p>
<p>137<br>00:14:25,899 –&gt; 00:14:35,819<br>random experiment of which on six are losses and six are wins for the contestant and so we discover</p>
<p>138<br>00:14:35,819 –&gt; 00:14:42,939<br>that there’s six wins and six losses. Now the way that this game works if you think about it if the</p>
<p>139<br>00:14:43,740 –&gt; 00:14:52,539<br>switching strategy wins that means that the sticking strategy would have lost because if switching</p>
<p>140<br>00:14:52,539 –&gt; 00:14:59,259<br>wins it meant that you switched to the door that had the prize and so if you hadn’t switched you</p>
<p>141<br>00:14:59,259 –&gt; 00:15:07,339<br>must have been in a door that didn’t have the prize and likewise if switching loses then you must have</p>
<p>142<br>00:15:07,339 –&gt; 00:15:12,219<br>switched from the door with the prize to a door that didn’t have the prize switching and that means</p>
<p>143<br>00:15:12,219 –&gt; 00:15:17,259<br>if you’d stock you would have won. So what we can say is that really analyzing the switch strategy</p>
<p>144<br>00:15:17,259 –&gt; 00:15:22,379<br>enables us to analyze the stick strategy simultaneously because you win by sticking if and only if</p>
<p>145<br>00:15:22,379 –&gt; 00:15:26,700<br>you lose by switching. Now this simplification doesn’t hold when there’s more than three doors</p>
<p>146<br>00:15:27,340 –&gt; 00:15:33,179<br>and that’s another exercise but for now it’s telling us that if we analyze the switch strategy we</p>
<p>147<br>00:15:33,179 –&gt; 00:15:39,899<br>also understand the stick the stick strategy and of course that means that if you use the stick</p>
<p>148<br>00:15:39,899 –&gt; 00:15:47,419<br>strategy then the six wins become losses and the six losses become wins and again there are six</p>
<p>149<br>00:15:47,419 –&gt; 00:15:54,299<br>ways to lose and six ways to win. So the first false conclusion from this is by reasoning about it as</p>
<p>150<br>00:15:54,299 –&gt; 00:16:00,860<br>though they were poker hands and the false conclusion says look sticking and switching win with the same</p>
<p>151<br>00:16:00,860 –&gt; 00:16:05,659<br>number of outcomes and lose with the same outcome number of outcomes so it really doesn’t matter whether</p>
<p>152<br>00:16:05,659 –&gt; 00:16:11,659<br>you stick or switch because the probability of winning in both cases is half the outcome six out of</p>
<p>153<br>00:16:11,659 –&gt; 00:16:16,860<br>twelve the probability doesn’t matter there makes no difference whether you stick or switch and</p>
<p>154<br>00:16:16,860 –&gt; 00:16:31,819<br>that’s wrong and we will see why. So the other false argument is that we think about what happens</p>
<p>155<br>00:16:31,819 –&gt; 00:16:39,899<br>after Carol has opened a door so where are we? The contestant has picked a door has no idea where the</p>
<p>156<br>00:16:39,899 –&gt; 00:16:47,419<br>go to the prize is. Carol opens a door and shows the contestant a go to what’s left? Well there’s two</p>
<p>157<br>00:16:47,419 –&gt; 00:16:53,579<br>closed doors left one is the door with the prize and the other is the door without the prize that has a</p>
<p>158<br>00:16:53,579 –&gt; 00:17:01,340<br>go behind it and there’s by symmetry of the doors the contestant has no idea what’s behind the door</p>
<p>159<br>00:17:01,340 –&gt; 00:17:07,259<br>that he picked or the remaining on open door they’re equally likely to contain the prize and so</p>
<p>160<br>00:17:07,900 –&gt; 00:17:14,460<br>the argument is again that whether you stick or switch between those two doors that haven’t yet been</p>
<p>161<br>00:17:14,460 –&gt; 00:17:20,379<br>opened it doesn’t really matter and so again the stick strategy and the switch strategy each win with</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:20,379 –&gt; 00:17:29,259<br>the same 50-50 probability and that’s wrong too. What’s wrong? Well let’s go back and look at this tree</p>
<p>163<br>00:17:29,259 –&gt; 00:17:34,940<br>a little bit more carefully to understand what’s going on and the first thing to notice about the tree</p>
<p>164<br>00:17:34,940 –&gt; 00:17:42,620<br>is that it’s not all that the structure of the tree leading to the leaves is not the same. Here’s a</p>
<p>165<br>00:17:42,620 –&gt; 00:17:50,059<br>leaf that has degree one. So here’s a leaf that has degree two one way to get in and only one</p>
<p>166<br>00:17:50,059 –&gt; 00:17:55,500<br>way out and here’s a leaf that has degree three one way in and two ways out if we think of going</p>
<p>167<br>00:17:55,500 –&gt; 00:18:01,180<br>from the root to the leaf and so it’s not clear that these branches these leaves should be treated</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:01,180 –&gt; 00:18:05,980<br>the same way. Well let’s think about it more carefully about how are we going to assign</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:05,980 –&gt; 00:18:12,860<br>probabilities to the various steps of the experiment. Well what we’re going to assume for simplicity is</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:12,860 –&gt; 00:18:21,019<br>that the staph chooses a door at random to place the prize so that means that each of these branches</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:21,019 –&gt; 00:18:26,220<br>occurs with probability one-third. A third of the time they put the prize behind door one, a third behind</p>
<p>172<br>00:18:26,220 –&gt; 00:18:31,980<br>door two and a third behind door three. Okay let’s continue exploring the branch where they put the</p>
<p>173<br>00:18:31,980 –&gt; 00:18:37,819<br>prize behind door one. At that point the contestant is going to pick a door and they can pick either</p>
<p>174<br>00:18:37,819 –&gt; 00:18:45,420<br>door one, two or three and absent any knowledge and also to be sure that they can’t be outgassed by</p>
<p>175<br>00:18:45,420 –&gt; 00:18:51,420<br>the staph realizing that they mostly prefer door one so they so if they’re going to switch they’ll</p>
<p>176<br>00:18:51,420 –&gt; 00:18:58,380<br>put the prize behind door one to fully contest it. The contestant’s protection is pick a door at random</p>
<p>177<br>00:18:58,380 –&gt; 00:19:04,460<br>to have choose a door one-third of the time and door two a third of the time and door three at a</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:04,460 –&gt; 00:19:10,620<br>third time in a completely unpredictable way and so the contestant is going to choose each of those</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:10,620 –&gt; 00:19:18,700<br>possible doors as their first choice with probability a third. Now what happens next? Well the next thing</p>
<p>180<br>00:19:18,700 –&gt; 00:19:23,580<br>that happens is that Carol opens a door. Now this is the case where Carol has a choice. The prize is</p>
<p>181<br>00:19:23,580 –&gt; 00:19:28,700<br>behind one and the contestant happened to pick door one. That means doors two and three both have</p>
<p>182<br>00:19:28,700 –&gt; 00:19:35,180<br>goats and again for simplicity let’s assume that Carol when she has a choice she can open either door</p>
<p>183<br>00:19:35,180 –&gt; 00:19:40,299<br>two or door three here does them with equal probability so we’re going to assign probability a half to</p>
<p>184<br>00:19:40,299 –&gt; 00:19:46,460<br>her opening door two when she has the choice between two or three and probability a half that she’ll</p>
<p>185<br>00:19:46,460 –&gt; 00:19:52,940<br>open door three and by the way we saw that those were losing outcomes for the contestant but here</p>
<p>186<br>00:19:52,940 –&gt; 00:19:59,100<br>things are a little different if the contestant has chose if the prize is behind door one and the contestant</p>
<p>187<br>00:19:59,100 –&gt; 00:20:07,340<br>has chosen door two Carol has no choice but to open the only other unchosen door with the goat behind</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:07,339 –&gt; 00:20:19,019<br>it namely door three so we could say that this choice really is probability one and I got a</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:19,019 –&gt; 00:20:23,819<br>little bit ahead of myself here but having filled in the probabilities on these edges what we figured</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:23,819 –&gt; 00:20:29,659<br>out is that the probability of this topmost branch of losing is we said well a third of the time you</p>
<p>191<br>00:20:29,660 –&gt; 00:20:39,420<br>go here and a third of that third you go here and half of that time you go to this vertex so it’s</p>
<p>192<br>00:20:39,420 –&gt; 00:20:46,620<br>a third of a third of a half of that or a weight of one 18th and by symmetry this gets weight one 18th</p>
<p>193<br>00:20:46,620 –&gt; 00:20:51,980<br>but this way a third of the time the prize is behind door one a third of the time the contestant</p>
<p>194<br>00:20:51,980 –&gt; 00:20:59,019<br>picks door two and after that Carol is forced to open door three so this branch occurs with</p>
<p>195<br>00:20:59,019 –&gt; 00:21:05,259<br>certainty it’s with probability one which means that we wind up at this leaf a third of a third</p>
<p>196<br>00:21:05,259 –&gt; 00:21:14,299<br>of the time for sure and its weight is one ninth and of course by symmetry the similar weights get</p>
<p>197<br>00:21:14,299 –&gt; 00:21:20,139<br>assigned to the winning and the losing so what we’ve concluded is that although there are six</p>
<p>198<br>00:21:20,140 –&gt; 00:21:28,460<br>wins the weight of the wins is six ninths because their ether were worth one ninth of the time</p>
<p>199<br>00:21:28,460 –&gt; 00:21:33,980<br>and that winning will occur two thirds of the time likewise there are six losses but they’re</p>
<p>200<br>00:21:33,980 –&gt; 00:21:42,940<br>each only work occur an 18th of a time and so we lose one third of the time by the switch strategy</p>
<p>201<br>00:21:42,940 –&gt; 00:21:49,980<br>the summary then is that the probability of winning if you switch is two thirds and</p>
<p>202<br>00:21:49,980 –&gt; 00:21:56,620<br>by the remark that you win with switching if and only if you lose with sticking it follows</p>
<p>203<br>00:21:56,620 –&gt; 00:22:03,339<br>that you lose by sticking two thirds of the time and so sticking is really a bad strategy and</p>
<p>204<br>00:22:03,339 –&gt; 00:22:10,299<br>switching is the dominant way to go now we’ve in class we back up this theoretical analysis it’s</p>
<p>205<br>00:22:10,299 –&gt; 00:22:16,620<br>very logical but the question is isn’t true and you can do statistical experiments and have</p>
<p>206<br>00:22:16,619 –&gt; 00:22:22,539<br>students pick doors and goats and prizes and sure enough it turns out that roughly two thirds</p>
<p>207<br>00:22:22,539 –&gt; 00:22:27,500<br>of the time and closer and closer to two thirds the more times you play the game the switching</p>
<p>208<br>00:22:27,500 –&gt; 00:22:36,779<br>strategy wins two thirds of the time so the second key idea and probability theory is that the outcomes</p>
<p>209<br>00:22:36,779 –&gt; 00:22:42,219<br>may have differing probabilities they may have differing weights unlike the poker hand case</p>
<p>210<br>00:22:42,299 –&gt; 00:22:49,420<br>when we look more closely at an experiment with different outcomes we will agree that for various</p>
<p>211<br>00:22:49,420 –&gt; 00:22:54,220<br>kinds of reasons of symmetry or logic and so on that it makes sense to assign different</p>
<p>212<br>00:22:54,220 –&gt; 00:22:59,180<br>probability weights to the different outcomes it’s not the case that the outcomes have uniform</p>
<p>213<br>00:22:59,180 –&gt; 00:23:08,700<br>probability that they’re all equally likely so to summarize um uh what happens especially</p>
<p>214<br>00:23:09,100 –&gt; 00:23:13,819<br>well this example illustrates the confusion about a probability theory that was engendered even</p>
<p>215<br>00:23:13,819 –&gt; 00:23:20,700<br>some serious experts but in general intuition is very important as in any subject but it’s also</p>
<p>216<br>00:23:20,700 –&gt; 00:23:26,860<br>dangerous in probability theory particularly for beginners who aren’t experienced about some of</p>
<p>217<br>00:23:26,860 –&gt; 00:23:32,620<br>these traps that you can fall into and so our proposal is that you be very wary of intuitive</p>
<p>218<br>00:23:32,620 –&gt; 00:23:37,900<br>arguments they’re valuable but you need another disciplined way to check them and we propose that</p>
<p>219<br>00:23:37,900 –&gt; 00:23:44,540<br>you stick with what we call the four-part method when you’re trying to devise a probability model</p>
<p>220<br>00:23:44,540 –&gt; 00:23:52,140<br>for some random experiment so the the steps are first that you try to identify the outcomes</p>
<p>221<br>00:23:52,140 –&gt; 00:23:58,460<br>of the random experiment and this is where the tree structure comes up if you try to model a step by</p>
<p>222<br>00:23:58,460 –&gt; 00:24:04,540<br>step at each stage of the tree what the possible sub-steps are in the overall process that yields</p>
<p>223<br>00:24:04,539 –&gt; 00:24:08,940<br>the random outcome that’s where the tree comes in as we illustrate it with Monty Hall</p>
<p>224<br>00:24:10,059 –&gt; 00:24:15,659<br>the next thing to do is among the outcomes identify the ones that you consider to be</p>
<p>225<br>00:24:15,659 –&gt; 00:24:23,180<br>the winning events or the winning outcomes or the outcomes in the event that you are concerned about</p>
<p>226<br>00:24:23,180 –&gt; 00:24:29,740<br>whether or not it happens getting to jacks uh picking the door with the prize so you I need to</p>
<p>227<br>00:24:29,740 –&gt; 00:24:34,539<br>identify the target event whose probability you’re interested in we could call it the winning</p>
<p>228<br>00:24:34,539 –&gt; 00:24:40,620<br>event the probability of winning the third key step is to try to use the tree and logic of it to</p>
<p>229<br>00:24:40,620 –&gt; 00:24:46,700<br>assign probabilities to the outcomes and the fourth step then is simply to compute the probability of</p>
<p>230<br>00:24:46,700 –&gt; 00:24:52,460<br>the event which you do in a very straightforward way by basically adding up the probabilities of</p>
<p>231<br>00:24:52,460 –&gt; 00:25:00,299<br>each of the outcomes in the event that is the fourth step method now this Monty Hall tree that we</p>
<p>232<br>00:25:00,299 –&gt; 00:25:09,019<br>came up with was um very literal and uh wildly unnecessarily complicated so let’s take another</p>
<p>233<br>00:25:09,019 –&gt; 00:25:14,380<br>look at that and a simpler argument that will lead us to the same conclusion about how the Monty</p>
<p>234<br>00:25:14,380 –&gt; 00:25:18,700<br>Hall game works and we’ll do that in the next video</p>
