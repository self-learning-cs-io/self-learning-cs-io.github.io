                <p>1<br>00:00:00,000 –&gt; 00:00:04,799<br>We ask about averages all the time and in the context of random variables,</p>
<p>2<br>00:00:04,799 –&gt; 00:00:10,620<br>averages get abstracted into a lovely concept called the expectation of the</p>
<p>3<br>00:00:10,620 –&gt; 00:00:15,480<br>random variable. Let’s begin with a motivating example which as is often the</p>
<p>4<br>00:00:15,480 –&gt; 00:00:21,120<br>case will come from gambling. So there’s a game that’s actually played in</p>
<p>5<br>00:00:21,120 –&gt; 00:00:28,620<br>Casino’s called Carnival Dice where you have three dice and the way you play is</p>
<p>6<br>00:00:28,620 –&gt; 00:00:32,340<br>you pick your favorite number from one to six whatever it happens to be and</p>
<p>7<br>00:00:32,340 –&gt; 00:00:36,420<br>then you roll the three dice. The dice are assumed to be fair so each one of</p>
<p>8<br>00:00:36,420 –&gt; 00:00:41,579<br>them has one one in six chance of coming up with any given number and then the</p>
<p>9<br>00:00:41,579 –&gt; 00:00:47,219<br>payoff goes as follows. For every match of your favorite number you get a</p>
<p>10<br>00:00:47,219 –&gt; 00:00:52,460<br>dollar and if none of your favorite, if none of the dice show your favorite</p>
<p>11<br>00:00:52,460 –&gt; 00:00:58,480<br>number then you lose a dollar. Okay let’s do an example. Suppose your</p>
<p>12<br>00:00:58,479 –&gt; 00:01:02,199<br>favorite number was five you announced that to the to the house or the dealer and</p>
<p>13<br>00:01:02,199 –&gt; 00:01:07,519<br>then the dice start rolling. Now if your role happened to come up with the</p>
<p>14<br>00:01:07,519 –&gt; 00:01:10,599<br>numbers two three and four well there’s no fives there so you’ve lost a dollar.</p>
<p>15<br>00:01:10,599 –&gt; 00:01:15,259<br>On the other hand if your roles came out five four six there’s one five you’ve</p>
<p>16<br>00:01:15,259 –&gt; 00:01:18,799<br>won a dollar if it came out five four five there’s two fives you’ve won a dollar</p>
<p>17<br>00:01:18,799 –&gt; 00:01:23,799<br>and if it was all five you’ve actually won three dollars. Now real Carnival Dice is</p>
<p>18<br>00:01:23,799 –&gt; 00:01:27,519<br>often played where either winner lose a dollar depending on whether there’s any</p>
<p>19<br>00:01:27,519 –&gt; 00:01:31,359<br>match at all but we’re playing a more generous game where if you double match</p>
<p>20<br>00:01:31,359 –&gt; 00:01:34,920<br>you get two dollars if you triple match you get three dollars. So the basic</p>
<p>21<br>00:01:34,920 –&gt; 00:01:40,519<br>question about this is is this a fair game is this worth playing and how can we</p>
<p>22<br>00:01:40,519 –&gt; 00:01:44,799<br>think about that? Well we’re gonna think about it probabilistically. So let’s</p>
<p>23<br>00:01:44,799 –&gt; 00:01:50,640<br>think about the probability of rolling no fives if five is my favorite number</p>
<p>24<br>00:01:50,640 –&gt; 00:01:54,699<br>what’s the probability that I rolled none of them? Well there’s a five out of</p>
<p>25<br>00:01:54,700 –&gt; 00:01:59,180<br>six chance that I don’t roll a five on the first die and on the second die and</p>
<p>26<br>00:01:59,180 –&gt; 00:02:02,840<br>on the third die and since the die roles are assumed to be independent the</p>
<p>27<br>00:02:02,840 –&gt; 00:02:08,740<br>dies are independent. The probability of no fives is five six to the third which</p>
<p>28<br>00:02:08,740 –&gt; 00:02:13,740<br>comes out to be 125, 216ths I’m running this out because we’re gonna put all</p>
<p>29<br>00:02:13,740 –&gt; 00:02:17,900<br>the numbers over 216th to make them easier to compare. Okay what’s the</p>
<p>30<br>00:02:17,900 –&gt; 00:02:23,780<br>probability of one five? Well the probability of any single sequence of die</p>
<p>31<br>00:02:23,780 –&gt; 00:02:31,060<br>roles with a single five is five sixth of no five times five six of no five times</p>
<p>32<br>00:02:31,060 –&gt; 00:02:37,099<br>one sixth of one five and there are three choose one possible sequences of</p>
<p>33<br>00:02:37,099 –&gt; 00:02:44,259<br>dice roles with one five and the others non-fives. Likewise for two fives there’s</p>
<p>34<br>00:02:44,259 –&gt; 00:02:54,780<br>three choose two times five six to the one which is one way of choosing the</p>
<p>35<br>00:02:54,780 –&gt; 00:03:00,139<br>place that does not have a five and one six times one sixth which is the</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:00,139 –&gt; 00:03:04,780<br>probability of getting fives in the other places. I didn’t say that well but you</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:04,780 –&gt; 00:03:10,019<br>can get it straight. Okay the probability of three fives is the probability of one</p>
<p>38<br>00:03:10,019 –&gt; 00:03:13,699<br>sixth of getting a five on the first die one six the getting a five on the second</p>
<p>39<br>00:03:13,699 –&gt; 00:03:18,899<br>die one six the getting a five on the third die simply one six cubed. Okay so we</p>
<p>40<br>00:03:18,899 –&gt; 00:03:22,739<br>can easily calculate these probabilities this is a familiar exercise. Let’s</p>
<p>41<br>00:03:22,739 –&gt; 00:03:27,739<br>put them in a chart. So what we figured out is that zero matches has a probability</p>
<p>42<br>00:03:27,739 –&gt; 00:03:34,739<br>of 125 over 216ths and in that case I lose a buck. One match turns out to have a</p>
<p>43<br>00:03:34,739 –&gt; 00:03:41,259<br>probability of 75 out of 216th and I win a dollar. Two matches is 15 out of 216th</p>
<p>44<br>00:03:41,259 –&gt; 00:03:46,500<br>and I win two dollars and three matches there’s one chance in 216 that I win the</p>
<p>45<br>00:03:46,500 –&gt; 00:03:53,519<br>three dollars. Okay so now I can ask about what do I expect to win suppose I</p>
<p>46<br>00:03:53,519 –&gt; 00:03:58,620<br>play 216 games and the game split exactly according to these probabilities.</p>
<p>47<br>00:03:58,620 –&gt; 00:04:05,139<br>Then what I would expect is that I would wind up with zero matches about 125</p>
<p>48<br>00:04:05,139 –&gt; 00:04:10,219<br>times that was the probability of there being no matches it was 125 216th. So if I</p>
<p>49<br>00:04:10,219 –&gt; 00:04:15,740<br>play two 16 games I expect about 125 we’re gonna I’m gonna win nothing or I’m</p>
<p>50<br>00:04:15,740 –&gt; 00:04:20,100<br>gonna get no matches which actually means I’ll lose a dollar on each. One match I</p>
<p>51<br>00:04:20,100 –&gt; 00:04:26,779<br>expect about 75 times two matches 15 times three matches once. So my average</p>
<p>52<br>00:04:26,779 –&gt; 00:04:34,939<br>win is gonna be 125 times minus one 75 times one 15 times two plus one times</p>
<p>53<br>00:04:34,939 –&gt; 00:04:42,500<br>three divided by 216th. So these numbers on the top where have the 216th roll split</p>
<p>54<br>00:04:42,500 –&gt; 00:04:46,740<br>among my choices of losing a dollar winning a dollar winning two dollars and</p>
<p>55<br>00:04:46,740 –&gt; 00:04:50,100<br>winning three dollars and it comes out to be slightly negative it’s actually</p>
<p>56<br>00:04:50,100 –&gt; 00:04:58,339<br>minus 8 cents minus to 17 216ths of a dollar which is about minus 8 cents. So I’m</p>
<p>57<br>00:04:58,339 –&gt; 00:05:03,659<br>losing on the average 8 cents per roll this is not a fair game it’s really biased</p>
<p>58<br>00:05:03,660 –&gt; 00:05:07,860<br>against me and if I keep playing long enough I’m gonna find that I average out a</p>
<p>59<br>00:05:07,860 –&gt; 00:05:15,700<br>kind of steady loss of about 8 cents a play. So we would summarize this by saying</p>
<p>60<br>00:05:15,700 –&gt; 00:05:20,620<br>that you expect to lose 8 cents meaning that your average loss is 8 cents and you</p>
<p>61<br>00:05:20,620 –&gt; 00:05:24,180<br>expect that that’s gonna be the phenomenon that comes up if you keep playing the</p>
<p>62<br>00:05:24,180 –&gt; 00:05:28,060<br>game repeatedly repeatedly. It’s important to notice of course you never actually</p>
<p>63<br>00:05:28,060 –&gt; 00:05:32,860<br>lose 8 cents on any single play so what you ex you this notion of you’re</p>
<p>64<br>00:05:32,860 –&gt; 00:05:37,800<br>expecting to lose 8 cents it never happens. It’s just your average loss. No</p>
<p>65<br>00:05:37,800 –&gt; 00:05:41,620<br>every single player either gonna lose a dollar win a dollar win two dollars win</p>
<p>66<br>00:05:41,620 –&gt; 00:05:48,100<br>three dollars there’s no 8 cents at all. Showing up. Okay so now let’s abstract the</p>
<p>67<br>00:05:48,100 –&gt; 00:05:53,340<br>expected value of a random variable all. So random variables is this the thing</p>
<p>68<br>00:05:53,340 –&gt; 00:05:57,139<br>that probabilistically takes on different values with different probabilities</p>
<p>69<br>00:05:57,139 –&gt; 00:06:02,540<br>and its expected value is defined to be its average value where the different</p>
<p>70<br>00:06:02,540 –&gt; 00:06:07,160<br>values are weighted by their probabilities. We can write this out as a precise</p>
<p>71<br>00:06:07,160 –&gt; 00:06:15,060<br>formula. The expectation of a random variable R is defined to be the sum over all</p>
<p>72<br>00:06:15,060 –&gt; 00:06:18,740<br>its possible values. It doesn’t indicate what the summation is but that’s over</p>
<p>73<br>00:06:18,740 –&gt; 00:06:25,660<br>all possible values V of V times the probability that V comes up the probability</p>
<p>74<br>00:06:25,660 –&gt; 00:06:30,780<br>that R equals V. So this is the basic definition of the expected value of a random</p>
<p>75<br>00:06:30,779 –&gt; 00:06:37,099<br>variable. Now let me mention here that this sum works because since we’re</p>
<p>76<br>00:06:37,099 –&gt; 00:06:43,059<br>assuming a countable sample space R is defined on only countably many outcomes</p>
<p>77<br>00:06:43,059 –&gt; 00:06:47,539<br>which means it can only take countably many values. So this is a countable sum</p>
<p>78<br>00:06:47,539 –&gt; 00:06:52,139<br>over all the possible values that R takes because there are only</p>
<p>79<br>00:06:52,139 –&gt; 00:06:58,179<br>accountably many. Accountably many of them. Okay and what we’ve just concluded</p>
<p>80<br>00:06:58,180 –&gt; 00:07:06,459<br>then is the expected win in the Carnival dice game is minus 17, 216. Check this</p>
<p>81<br>00:07:06,459 –&gt; 00:07:11,100<br>formal definition of the expectation of a random variable versus the random</p>
<p>82<br>00:07:11,100 –&gt; 00:07:17,939<br>variable defined to be how much you win on a given play of Carnival dice and it</p>
<p>83<br>00:07:17,939 –&gt; 00:07:24,819<br>comes out to be that average minus minus 17 over 216. Now there’s a technical</p>
<p>84<br>00:07:24,819 –&gt; 00:07:30,099<br>result that’s useful in some proofs and that says that there’s another way to</p>
<p>85<br>00:07:30,099 –&gt; 00:07:34,540<br>get the expectation. The expectation can also be expressed by saying it’s the</p>
<p>86<br>00:07:34,540 –&gt; 00:07:38,740<br>sum over all the possible outcomes in the sample space. This is the sample</p>
<p>87<br>00:07:38,740 –&gt; 00:07:45,219<br>space of the value of the random variable at that outcome times the probability of</p>
<p>88<br>00:07:45,219 –&gt; 00:07:52,219<br>that outcome. So this is another definition, an alternative definition of compared to</p>
<p>89<br>00:07:52,220 –&gt; 00:07:59,420<br>saying that it’s the sum over all the values times the probability of that</p>
<p>90<br>00:07:59,420 –&gt; 00:08:04,460<br>value. Here it’s the sum over all the outcomes of the value of the random</p>
<p>91<br>00:08:04,460 –&gt; 00:08:07,820<br>variable at the outcome times the probability of the outcome. It’s not entirely</p>
<p>92<br>00:08:07,820 –&gt; 00:08:11,420<br>obvious that those two definitions are equivalent. This form of the</p>
<p>93<br>00:08:11,420 –&gt; 00:08:15,500<br>definition turns out to be technically helpful in some proofs although outside</p>
<p>94<br>00:08:15,500 –&gt; 00:08:19,460<br>approves you don’t use it so much in applications but it’s not a bad</p>
<p>95<br>00:08:19,459 –&gt; 00:08:23,539<br>exercise to prove this equivalence. So I’m going to walk you through it but if</p>
<p>96<br>00:08:23,539 –&gt; 00:08:27,779<br>it’s boring it’s kind of a boring series of equations on slides and you’re</p>
<p>97<br>00:08:27,779 –&gt; 00:08:32,100<br>welcome to skip past it. It is a derivation that I expect you to be able to</p>
<p>98<br>00:08:32,100 –&gt; 00:08:35,980<br>carry out. So let’s just carry out this derivation. I’m going to prove that the</p>
<p>99<br>00:08:35,980 –&gt; 00:08:40,699<br>expectation is equal to the sum over all the outcomes of the value of the</p>
<p>100<br>00:08:40,699 –&gt; 00:08:44,860<br>random variable at the outcome times the probability of the outcome and let’s</p>
<p>101<br>00:08:44,860 –&gt; 00:08:48,940<br>prove it. In order to prove it let’s begin with one little remark that’s used</p>
<p>102<br>00:08:48,940 –&gt; 00:08:55,340<br>okay. Remember that this notation r equals v describes the event that the random</p>
<p>103<br>00:08:55,340 –&gt; 00:09:00,139<br>variable takes the value of v which by definition is an event is the set of</p>
<p>104<br>00:09:00,139 –&gt; 00:09:05,980<br>outcomes where this property holds. So it’s the set of outcomes omega where r of</p>
<p>105<br>00:09:05,980 –&gt; 00:09:12,340<br>omega is equal to v. So let’s just remember that. That brackets r equals v is the</p>
<p>106<br>00:09:12,340 –&gt; 00:09:17,460<br>event that r is equal to v meaning the set of outcomes where that’s true. So what</p>
<p>107<br>00:09:17,460 –&gt; 00:09:20,980<br>that tells us in particular is that the probability of r equals v is by</p>
<p>108<br>00:09:20,980 –&gt; 00:09:27,340<br>definition the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in the event. So it’s the</p>
<p>109<br>00:09:27,340 –&gt; 00:09:34,100<br>sum over all those outcomes. Now let’s go back to the original definition of</p>
<p>110<br>00:09:34,100 –&gt; 00:09:38,980<br>the expectation of r. The original definition is an the standard one is it’s the</p>
<p>111<br>00:09:38,980 –&gt; 00:09:44,340<br>sum over all the values of the value times the probability that the random</p>
<p>112<br>00:09:44,340 –&gt; 00:09:48,940<br>variable is equal to the value. Now on the previous slide we just had a formula</p>
<p>113<br>00:09:48,940 –&gt; 00:09:54,539<br>for the probability that r is equal to v. It’s simply the sum over all the</p>
<p>114<br>00:09:54,539 –&gt; 00:10:00,779<br>outcomes of where r is equal to v of the probability of that outcome. So I can</p>
<p>115<br>00:10:00,779 –&gt; 00:10:05,659<br>replace that term by the sum over all the outcomes of the probability of the</p>
<p>116<br>00:10:05,659 –&gt; 00:10:10,500<br>outcome. Okay. So I’m trying to head towards an expression that’s only outcomes</p>
<p>117<br>00:10:10,500 –&gt; 00:10:14,459<br>which is kind of the top level strategy here. So the first thing I did was I got</p>
<p>118<br>00:10:14,459 –&gt; 00:10:19,019<br>rid of that probability of v and replaced it by the sum of all these</p>
<p>119<br>00:10:19,019 –&gt; 00:10:23,379<br>probability of the probabilities of all the outcomes where r is v. Well next</p>
<p>120<br>00:10:23,379 –&gt; 00:10:29,459<br>step is I’m going to just distribute the v over the inner sum and I get that</p>
<p>121<br>00:10:29,459 –&gt; 00:10:34,299<br>this thing is equal to the sum over again over all those outcomes in r equals</p>
<p>122<br>00:10:34,299 –&gt; 00:10:41,099<br>v of v times the probability of the outcome. But look the out these outcomes are</p>
<p>123<br>00:10:41,099 –&gt; 00:10:50,379<br>the outcomes where r is equal to v. So I can replace that v by r of omega. That</p>
<p>124<br>00:10:50,379 –&gt; 00:10:54,939<br>one slip sideways a little bit. So let’s watch that. This v is simply going to</p>
<p>125<br>00:10:54,939 –&gt; 00:11:00,699<br>become an r of omega. Well I’m still summing over the same set of</p>
<p>126<br>00:11:00,700 –&gt; 00:11:06,500<br>omega. But now I’ve gotten pretty much everything but the omega. So I’ve got</p>
<p>127<br>00:11:06,500 –&gt; 00:11:13,060<br>this inner sum of over all possible omega in r of v of r of omega times the</p>
<p>128<br>00:11:13,060 –&gt; 00:11:17,259<br>probability of omega. And I’m summing over all possible v. But if I’m summing</p>
<p>129<br>00:11:17,259 –&gt; 00:11:21,580<br>over all possible v and then all possible outcomes where r is equal to v, I</p>
<p>130<br>00:11:21,580 –&gt; 00:11:26,900<br>wind up summing over all possible outcomes. And so I’ve finished the proof</p>
<p>131<br>00:11:26,899 –&gt; 00:11:32,819<br>that the expectation of r is equal to the sum over all the outcomes of r of</p>
<p>132<br>00:11:32,819 –&gt; 00:11:38,779<br>omega times the probability of omega. Now I’d never do a proof like this in a</p>
<p>133<br>00:11:38,779 –&gt; 00:11:42,740<br>lecture because I think watching a lecturer write stuff on the board a whole</p>
<p>134<br>00:11:42,740 –&gt; 00:11:46,500<br>bunch of symbols and manipulating equations is really incipit and boring. Most</p>
<p>135<br>00:11:46,500 –&gt; 00:11:50,259<br>people can’t follow it anyway. I’m hoping that in the video where you can go</p>
<p>136<br>00:11:50,259 –&gt; 00:11:53,740<br>back if you wish and replay it and watch it more slowly or at your own speed,</p>
<p>137<br>00:11:53,740 –&gt; 00:11:58,779<br>the derivation will be of some value to you. But let’s step back a little bit</p>
<p>138<br>00:11:58,779 –&gt; 00:12:04,659<br>and notice some top-level technical things that we never really paid attention to</p>
<p>139<br>00:12:04,659 –&gt; 00:12:09,100<br>in the process of doing this manipulative proof. So the top-level observation</p>
<p>140<br>00:12:09,100 –&gt; 00:12:13,779<br>first of all is that this proof like many proofs in basic foundations of</p>
<p>141<br>00:12:13,779 –&gt; 00:12:18,500<br>probability theory and random variables in particular involves taking sums and</p>
<p>142<br>00:12:18,500 –&gt; 00:12:23,340<br>rearranging the terms in the sums a lot. So the first question is why sums?</p>
<p>143<br>00:12:23,340 –&gt; 00:12:29,980<br>Remember here we were summing over all the possible variables, all the possible</p>
<p>144<br>00:12:29,980 –&gt; 00:12:35,620<br>values of some random variable. Why is that a sum? Well it’s a sum because we</p>
<p>145<br>00:12:35,620 –&gt; 00:12:41,019<br>were assuming that the sample space was countable. There were only a countable</p>
<p>146<br>00:12:41,019 –&gt; 00:12:49,820<br>number of values r of omega 0, r of omega 1, r of omega and so on. And so we can</p>
<p>147<br>00:12:49,820 –&gt; 00:12:53,540<br>be sure that the sum over all the possible values of the random variable is</p>
<p>148<br>00:12:53,540 –&gt; 00:12:58,740<br>accountable sum. It’s a sum and we don’t have to worry about integrals which is</p>
<p>149<br>00:12:58,740 –&gt; 00:13:03,420<br>the main technical reason why we’re doing discrete probability and assuming that</p>
<p>150<br>00:13:03,420 –&gt; 00:13:07,900<br>there are only a countable number of outcomes. There’s a second very important</p>
<p>151<br>00:13:07,900 –&gt; 00:13:13,020<br>technicality that’s worth mentioning. All the proofs involved rearranging terms in</p>
<p>152<br>00:13:13,019 –&gt; 00:13:20,340<br>sums freely and without care. But that means that we’re implicitly assuming</p>
<p>153<br>00:13:20,340 –&gt; 00:13:25,620<br>that it’s safe to do that and that in particular that the defining sum for</p>
<p>154<br>00:13:25,620 –&gt; 00:13:31,139<br>expectations needs to be absolutely convergent and all of these sums need to be</p>
<p>155<br>00:13:31,139 –&gt; 00:13:35,460<br>absolutely convergent in order for that kind of rearrangement to make sense.</p>
<p>156<br>00:13:35,460 –&gt; 00:13:41,419<br>So remember that absolute convergence means that the sum of the absolute</p>
<p>157<br>00:13:41,419 –&gt; 00:13:47,979<br>values of all the terms in the sum converge. So if we look at this definition of</p>
<p>158<br>00:13:47,979 –&gt; 00:13:52,099<br>expectation it said it was the sum over all the values in the range. We know</p>
<p>159<br>00:13:52,099 –&gt; 00:13:56,299<br>that’s accountable sum of the value times the probability that r was equal to</p>
<p>160<br>00:13:56,299 –&gt; 00:14:01,979<br>that value. But the very definition never specified the order in which these</p>
<p>161<br>00:14:01,979 –&gt; 00:14:07,019<br>terms v times probability r equals v got added up. It better not make a difference.</p>
<p>162<br>00:14:07,019 –&gt; 00:14:13,419<br>So we’re implicitly assuming absolute convergence of this sum in order for</p>
<p>163<br>00:14:13,419 –&gt; 00:14:17,740<br>the expectation to even be well defined. As a matter of fact the terrible pathology</p>
<p>164<br>00:14:17,740 –&gt; 00:14:21,100<br>that happens and you may have learned about this in first-term calculus and we</p>
<p>165<br>00:14:21,100 –&gt; 00:14:25,259<br>actually have a problem in the text about it is that you can have sums like</p>
<p>166<br>00:14:25,259 –&gt; 00:14:31,259<br>this that are not absolutely convergent and and then you pick your favorite</p>
<p>167<br>00:14:31,259 –&gt; 00:14:35,860<br>value and I can rearrange the terms in the sum so that it converges to that</p>
<p>168<br>00:14:35,860 –&gt; 00:14:43,980<br>value. When you’re dealing with non-absolute value sums rearranging is a no-no</p>
<p>169<br>00:14:43,980 –&gt; 00:14:49,820<br>the sum depends crucially on the order in which the terms appear and all of the</p>
<p>170<br>00:14:49,820 –&gt; 00:14:53,860<br>reasoning and probability theory would be an applicable. So we are implicitly</p>
<p>171<br>00:14:53,860 –&gt; 00:15:01,539<br>assuming that all of these sums are absolutely convergent. Well just to get</p>
<p>172<br>00:15:01,539 –&gt; 00:15:05,220<br>some vocabulary in place the expected value is also known as the mean value</p>
<p>173<br>00:15:05,220 –&gt; 00:15:12,540<br>or the mean or the expectation of the random variable. Now let’s connect up</p>
<p>174<br>00:15:12,540 –&gt; 00:15:17,340<br>expectations with averages in a more precise way. We said that the expectation</p>
<p>175<br>00:15:17,340 –&gt; 00:15:21,220<br>was kind of an abstraction of averages but it’s more intimately connected to</p>
<p>176<br>00:15:21,220 –&gt; 00:15:24,779<br>averages than that even. Let’s take an example where suppose you have a pile of</p>
<p>177<br>00:15:24,779 –&gt; 00:15:31,019<br>graded exams and you pick one at random. Let’s let s be the score of the randomly</p>
<p>178<br>00:15:31,019 –&gt; 00:15:37,620<br>picked exam. So I’m turning this process, this random process of picking an</p>
<p>179<br>00:15:37,620 –&gt; 00:15:43,419<br>exam from the graph, from the pile, is defining a random variable s where by</p>
<p>180<br>00:15:43,419 –&gt; 00:15:48,179<br>definition of picking one at random I mean uniformly. So s is actually not a</p>
<p>181<br>00:15:48,179 –&gt; 00:15:52,259<br>uniform random variable but I’m picking the exams with equal probability and</p>
<p>182<br>00:15:52,259 –&gt; 00:15:58,620<br>then they have different scores. So the outcomes are of uniform probability but</p>
<p>183<br>00:15:58,620 –&gt; 00:16:02,820<br>s is not because there might be a lot of outcomes, a lot of exams with the</p>
<p>184<br>00:16:02,820 –&gt; 00:16:07,779<br>same score. Alright, s is a random variable defined by this process of picking a</p>
<p>185<br>00:16:07,779 –&gt; 00:16:12,860<br>random exam. So and then you can just check that the expectation of s now</p>
<p>186<br>00:16:12,860 –&gt; 00:16:18,580<br>exactly equals the average exam score which is the typical thing that students</p>
<p>187<br>00:16:18,580 –&gt; 00:16:22,940<br>want to know when the exam is done, what’s the average score? Actually the average</p>
<p>188<br>00:16:22,940 –&gt; 00:16:27,659<br>score is often less informative than median score, the middle score, but people</p>
<p>189<br>00:16:27,659 –&gt; 00:16:31,860<br>somehow rather always want to know about the averages. The reason why the average</p>
<p>190<br>00:16:31,860 –&gt; 00:16:37,339<br>may not be so informative is because it has some weird properties that are</p>
<p>191<br>00:16:37,339 –&gt; 00:16:43,139<br>little straight in a second but the point here of what we did where we took the</p>
<p>192<br>00:16:43,139 –&gt; 00:16:50,620<br>we got at the average score on the exam by defining a random variable based on</p>
<p>193<br>00:16:50,620 –&gt; 00:16:56,659<br>picking a random exam. So that’s a general process. We can estimate averages in</p>
<p>194<br>00:16:56,659 –&gt; 00:17:02,899<br>some population of things by estimating the expectations of random</p>
<p>195<br>00:17:02,899 –&gt; 00:17:08,220<br>variables based on picking random elements from the thing that we’re</p>
<p>196<br>00:17:08,220 –&gt; 00:17:12,740<br>averaging over. That’s called sampling and it’s a basic idea of probability</p>
<p>197<br>00:17:12,740 –&gt; 00:17:20,099<br>theory that we’re going to be able to get a hold of averages by abstracting the</p>
<p>198<br>00:17:20,099 –&gt; 00:17:26,299<br>calculation of an average into taking defining a random variable and</p>
<p>199<br>00:17:26,299 –&gt; 00:17:32,859<br>calculating its expectation. Let’s look at an example. It’s obviously impossible</p>
<p>200<br>00:17:32,859 –&gt; 00:17:37,139<br>for all the exams to be above average because then the average would be above</p>
<p>201<br>00:17:37,139 –&gt; 00:17:41,419<br>average. That’s absurd. So if you translate that into a formal statement about</p>
<p>202<br>00:17:41,419 –&gt; 00:17:45,659<br>expectations it translates directly by the way. I don’t know how many of you</p>
<p>203<br>00:17:45,660 –&gt; 00:17:50,620<br>listened to the Prairie Home Companion but one of the sign-offs there is at</p>
<p>204<br>00:17:50,620 –&gt; 00:17:55,019<br>the town of Lake Wobegon in Wisconsin where all the children are above average.</p>
<p>205<br>00:17:55,019 –&gt; 00:18:01,380<br>Well, take possible. That translates into this technical statement that the</p>
<p>206<br>00:18:01,380 –&gt; 00:18:07,220<br>probability that a random variable is greater than its expected value is less</p>
<p>207<br>00:18:07,220 –&gt; 00:18:14,460<br>than one. It can’t always be greater than its expected value. That’s absurd.</p>
<p>208<br>00:18:14,460 –&gt; 00:18:21,100<br>On the other hand, it’s actually possible for the probability that the random</p>
<p>209<br>00:18:21,100 –&gt; 00:18:25,579<br>variable is bigger than its expected value to be as close to one as you want.</p>
<p>210<br>00:18:25,579 –&gt; 00:18:31,779<br>One way to think about that is that for example almost everyone has an above</p>
<p>211<br>00:18:31,779 –&gt; 00:18:36,299<br>average number of fingers. Think about that for a second. Almost everyone has an</p>
<p>212<br>00:18:36,299 –&gt; 00:18:40,380<br>above average number of fingers. Well, the explanation is really simple. It’s</p>
<p>213<br>00:18:40,380 –&gt; 00:18:48,660<br>simply because amputation is much more common than polydactylism. And if you can’t</p>
<p>214<br>00:18:48,660 –&gt; 00:18:52,860<br>understand what I just said, look it up and think about it.</p>
