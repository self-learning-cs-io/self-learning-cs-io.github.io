1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,400
look streets

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,900
can

3
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,539
I'm over here at the county jail of the city.

4
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,780
DJ Merchor's in there.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,719
It's not looking good.

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,259
Whatever, he's behind on child support.

7
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,739
So let's just go through this.

8
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,420
So again, the purpose of this lecture is we want to discuss

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,179
the logistics for the course now,

10
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,420
you know, online rather than in person.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,659
So that way in the first day of class next week,

12
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,579
we can just jump into all the database stuff right away.

13
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,460
All right, so let's go through this.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,379
The reason again, why am I down here at the county jail?

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,420
Well, because the database is, right?

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,620
And this is what this course is really all about.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,700
So that we're focusing on the most important things

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,780
in your life.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,659
And yes, sometimes bad things happen.

20
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,060
So for me, the two most important things in my life

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,900
are my wife and my biological daughter, first,

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,939
they're number one.

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,900
And then after that, it's just databases.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,060
That's really what you should be getting out of this course.

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,140
The databases is all consuming.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,219
Everything in the world is a database problem.

27
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,180
And you'll have, I think, a better appreciation

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,180
for this kind of stuff.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,180
So again, we'll cover this in class next week.

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,660
But another thing important thing to point out

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,780
for this lecture this semester is,

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,260
we're gracially sponsored by SingleStore.

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,220
And they're helping out with, of course, development.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,780
So SingleStore is a in-memory column store distributed

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,820
database system that supports just in time

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,140
great compilation.

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,660
Now, if none of that makes sense for you right now,

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,980
that's fine because we'll cover all these things

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,219
throughout this semester.

40
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,980
And so we're grateful for them helping us out.

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,140
And they'll become giving a guest lecture at the end

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,659
of the semester.

43
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,260
So more than that as we go along.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,259
All right, so today's lecture real quickly.

45
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,900
We're going to first obviously discuss the wait list.

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,659
That's what a lot of you guys care about.

47
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,180
Then we'll talk about the rules we have for the lectures.

48
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,620
And then we'll go through all the course logistics

49
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,860
including homeworks and projects.

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,539
So the first thing to obviously deal with is the wait list.

51
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,060
It should probably aware of your senior student.

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,500
The wait list is quite long.

53
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,460
And there's more people that can take one take the course

54
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,620
than we can actually accommodate.

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,420
So at this point, the CS department has taken over

56
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,819
the wait list from us because they need

57
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,500
to make sure that certain students need to graduate.

58
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,620
And you know, hands, take us to source of black,

59
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
there's all that.

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,420
They all get threatened.

61
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,420
So the professors have no control over the wait list.

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,300
So if you send this email, there's not much.

63
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,939
There's nothing we can do.

64
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,020
And the admins will then move students off the wait list.

65
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,939
But they're not going to always go in the order

66
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,300
that you're ranked in the wait list.

67
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,420
Because there's multiple sections.

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,300
There's undergrad, there's master students.

69
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,540
So just because you're some low-known on the wait list,

70
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,380
there's no guarantee that we can get you in the semester.

71
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,740
The good news is that since we hired Jim Neshpatel

72
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,820
as the new data professor with me here at Carnegie Mellon,

73
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,260
we can now offer $15, $14, $14, $5, $625 every semester.

74
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,739
So we'll be offered again in spring 2024

75
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,259
in addition to this semester.

76
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,179
All right, so the other thing, when we have the in class lectures,

77
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,939
it's really important that I wanted to be interactive.

78
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,259
We don't just just stand up there for an hour

79
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,899
and paddle on about databases.

80
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:42,579
It's always helpful.

81
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,219
It's always fun when students ask questions.

82
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:47,299
And these questions could be either because we're

83
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,899
talking too fast and you want us to slow down.

84
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,340
I get excited when I talk about databases.

85
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,180
So I'm going to do that, please tell me to shut up and slow down.

86
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,180
And certainly if you don't understand what we're talking about,

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,060
it's good to interrupt to ask clarifying questions.

88
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,420
Because maybe there's something about in the slides

89
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,340
or the discussion that makes sense.

90
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,580
And oftentimes, too, if you have questions,

91
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,740
other people have same questions as well.

92
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,420
So please, anytime during the lectures,

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,980
please interrupt us with anything that's

94
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,219
dated which we later.

95
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,740
What we don't know when we're going to interrupt it about is whether

96
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,980
or not you can go to the bathroom because you

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,140
don't have to answer missions.

98
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,180
We also don't want to be interrupted about blockchains.

99
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,460
Watching for databases or stupid.

100
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,300
We're not going to cover this.

101
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,420
There's no need to cover that.

102
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,379
I assure someone is about this.

103
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:35,819
We're not covering these things.

104
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,740
So now, because I want you to interrupt us

105
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,420
while we're giving lectures, that means

106
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,900
that we don't want you to come at the end of the lecture

107
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,300
and say, oh, what about slide three?

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,060
I did this to make sense of this over.

109
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,500
In the past, we've always finished lectures.

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,660
And then there's several students lined up

111
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,379
asking the same question over again.

112
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,660
And again, this is what I'm saying.

113
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,019
If you interrupt us as we're going along,

114
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,860
it'll help everyone at the same time.

115
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,699
So please, we're not, we want to answer any questions

116
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,939
about the slides immediately after class.

117
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,220
All right, so what is this course?

118
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,860
So 15405, 645 is a course about the designed implementation

119
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,259
of the database minlist systems.

120
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,459
Now, which is, we're going to discuss relational database

121
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,579
minlist systems.

122
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,779
And we'll cover that in the next lecture.

123
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,259
But it's really about how you should

124
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,860
have to build these systems.

125
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,539
So this is in the course about how to use one.

126
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,539
This is, of course, how to build an application that

127
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,099
uses an O or M to make calls to the database or whatever.

128
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:38,779
It is really how you build the internals of these systems.

129
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,019
And the reason why this is the one

130
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,379
to focus on this topic, because no matter where you go

131
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,860
in your life, in any aspect of computer science,

132
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,819
or even outside of your computer science,

133
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,639
there'll be times where you're always

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,219
going to be interacting with the database.

135
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,899
And therefore, you need to know how these things are actually

136
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,420
running.

137
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,019
So the end of you don't go off and go to single store

138
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,219
and work on actually the internal database system.

139
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,740
You need to know what's actually going on.

140
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,459
They help you understand why the system is

141
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,819
behaving a certain way.

142
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,060
And I actually have people email me and tell me

143
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,539
that a lot of the concepts of the database

144
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,819
are applicable to other things, like Q and systems and whatnot.

145
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,379
So the things we're covering this semester,

146
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,300
I think will be super useful throughout your time

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,540
here.

148
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,660
So if you want to learn about how to use a database system,

149
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,460
or how to administer a database system, like being a TBA,

150
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,259
there's a couple courses in Heinz College

151
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,060
that you should probably take instead.

152
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,740
This is really about, like, if you want

153
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,540
to get your hands dirty on the internals of these systems.

154
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,980
So the logistics of the course, everything

155
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,580
will be on the course website.

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,819
We'll be publishing that very soon.

157
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,740
The all the discussions and announcements

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,460
throughout the semester will be done through Piazza.

159
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,259
All the homeworks and projects will be submitted

160
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,180
through Grayscope.

161
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,699
Everything will be automated.

162
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,299
And then the final grades will be posted on campus.

163
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:59,019
And again, if you're enrolled in the course,

164
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,139
officially, you should have access to all these things

165
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,779
right now.

166
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,699
So if you're a non-SIMU student, because I

167
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,939
know a lot of you outside SIMU, like the watch lectures

168
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,500
and the computer projects, well, we

169
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,620
have a separate Grayscope account set up for the course that

170
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,019
will mirror what the official SIMU one does.

171
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,420
And you can use this code to log in and get access to it.

172
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,980
And this will allow you to submit your projects

173
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,980
and get graded the same way that the SIMU students do.

174
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,540
So again, if you're a non-SIMU student,

175
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,980
we ask you, since we're providing this,

176
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,899
we have our materials for you for your charge,

177
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,579
please don't post your solutions on GitHub.

178
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,259
Please don't email myself, jignash, or the TAs, for help.

179
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,899
Just because we have so many people

180
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:40,860
who need help here at SIMU.

181
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,579
We can't help everyone.

182
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,779
There is a Discord channel that actually is not one

183
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,819
by SIMU.

184
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,539
Somebody outside of it has sent this up.

185
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,300
This sort of becomes an effective location

186
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,620
for discussing various tasks before.

187
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,819
So I encourage you to sign up and check that out.

188
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,099
And again, in exchange for helping us out with this,

189
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,259
or us helping everyone with these materials,

190
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,299
I ask you, if someone please finish my Wikipedia article,

191
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,659
I think it's been flagged.

192
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:12,379
Because there was some stuff that was sort of true,

193
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,379
not true, or whatever.

194
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,180
Someone could fix that for me, that would be great.

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,060
All right, there's a text book for the course.

196
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,459
Database systems concepts from Silver Shots,

197
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,740
forth and Shundershin.

198
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,060
It's not required, like there's no homeworks

199
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,219
that are based on it.

200
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:27,980
But if you want supplemental reading beyond,

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,740
we discuss in the class, there'll be a reading

202
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,340
so you can go and dive deeper into the data various topics.

203
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,860
Now, there are going to be some things

204
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,019
that we discuss that the text book doesn't cover.

205
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,819
I don't think it covers as well as they should.

206
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:44,899
And that would provide lecture notes

207
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,579
as PDF files that are available there.

208
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,259
Whether you need to buy this text book or not,

209
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:52,860
it's up to you.

210
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,779
And it depends on how deep you can really

211
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,539
get my go into this material.

212
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,659
So the grading rubric for this semester

213
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:01,620
is going to be following.

214
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,019
So this is a project heavy course.

215
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,100
The 45% of the grade will be based on your projects.

216
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,579
And I'll discuss what these are in a second.

217
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,900
It'll be five homework assignments, four projects,

218
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,139
then a midterm exam and a final exam.

219
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,940
We'll see the breakdown here.

220
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,580
So all the homeworks will be based on the material

221
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,700
we cover in class and in the assigned readings.

222
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,259
The first homework assignment will be a SQL project

223
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,940
where you have to write some SQL queries

224
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,820
on against a data set and put a city correct answer.

225
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,740
Everything after that, please.

226
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,460
For homeworks will be all kinds of paper,

227
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
just those in grades and grades and the order

228
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,500
we did there.

229
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,980
Again, it's CMU.

230
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,780
Everyone knows this.

231
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,259
All your homeworks should be done individually.

232
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,980
And you shouldn't copy it up each other.

233
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,820
All the projects will be based on a system

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,660
with the invoiting for several years now here,

235
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,700
here, kind of you know, called bus term.

236
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,500
We discussed in class what the name bus term actually means,

237
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,740
or what it came from.

238
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,379
But the idea here is that it's a educational

239
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,659
test bed database system where you will do all your projects

240
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,580
on and you'll see over time as you add more features

241
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,419
to the database system, you'll get about understanding

242
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,419
how all the various layers fit together and run queries

243
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,179
and you can see results based on the stuff

244
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,460
that you actually build.

245
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,820
So it's very important that you don't fall behind

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,220
on the projects because every project

247
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,620
is going to build on the previous one.

248
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,779
Like in Project One, you're going to build a buffal cool manager.

249
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,220
And then in Project Two, you're going to build an index

250
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,899
that gets pages or gets memory.

251
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,500
So it's really important that you stay in track,

252
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,379
start projects early and don't fall behind.

253
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,500
Plus top is written in C++, specifically,

254
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,419
I think it's, what, C++ 20 now?

255
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,699
Not 17.

256
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,860
We don't use all the advanced features

257
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,259
in the new version, so C++,

258
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,299
but the assumptions that you're coming into this class

259
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,779
with the familiarity and being comfortable

260
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,939
with writing and debugging C++.

261
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,860
And so I think there's a post on piata,

262
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,139
whether 2, 13, 5, 13 was enough for this.

263
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,139
The answer is no.

264
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,620
Some of the things you'll be able to pick up

265
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,460
as you go along, but it's,

266
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,699
I think it's a little more advanced than 2, 13.

267
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,379
All color layers, it late days in a second,

268
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,259
but there's, all the late days are only allowed projects

269
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,580
on the homeworks and you're given four late days

270
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,299
that you can use for any project as you go along.

271
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,500
And as we release each project,

272
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,939
there'll be an online presentation

273
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,860
that will hold where you can come in as,

274
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,740
like week after the project released,

275
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,980
after you've sort of looked at the code,

276
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,100
you can come in as questions about it with the TAs

277
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,899
or that make that available for every.

278
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,060
So as a post in the email and I'll post with you else again,

279
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,379
there is a project zero that require all students

280
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,700
that want to take the class, have to complete.

281
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,060
And this is really a safety mechanism

282
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,420
to make sure that in your coming to this class,

283
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,100
prepare to write C++ code.

284
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,740
And so it's not graded in that it doesn't affect

285
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,259
your final score in the class,

286
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,060
which you're required to complete it

287
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,259
because again, we don't want people

288
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,580
who don't know C++ to think they're gonna pick it up

289
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,259
as they go along throughout the semester.

290
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,259
And then realize, oh, I have them though,

291
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,980
C++ learns C++ and learn Davis at the same time.

292
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,060
It does not end well.

293
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,139
Trust me, I've done this enough that we realize

294
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,340
that this is really helped you

295
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
rather than make you like on your own.

296
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,300
So if you do not complete this project zero

297
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
by the deadline of September 10th,

298
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,820
we're gonna ask you to withdraw from this.

299
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,060
And zero exceptionally made,

300
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,580
I don't care that your brother took five,

301
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,420
13, 10 years ago and you saw what he did that kind of,

302
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,259
it doesn't matter, you have to complete this.

303
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,459
It shouldn't take that much time, right?

304
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,939
It's a pretty basic try.

305
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,819
For office hours, myself, Jignesh and the TAs

306
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,219
will hold office hours at various times during the week,

307
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,979
but he Monday and Friday.

308
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,259
And then there won't be any office hours regularly

309
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,539
on Saturdays, but the day before every project is due,

310
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,539
we'll have a sort of power session.

311
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,139
We have multiple TAs for multiple hours available

312
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,419
for a beautiful thing as questions were.

313
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,740
But this means that there won't be any office hours

314
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,699
on the Sunday when projects are due

315
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,419
because we don't want people to wait to the last minute

316
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,339
to try to work on something.

317
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,699
And then hoping the TAs will help them figure things out.

318
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,539
Again, this is a forcing function to make sure

319
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,579
that you are making progress,

320
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,059
start working projects as soon as they're released.

321
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,579
So you're not trying to do as much as you can

322
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:29,779
at the last day.

323
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,860
Because it's consistent programming is not easy.

324
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,980
And you will make mistakes

325
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,620
and you'll have a takes time to figure things out.

326
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,179
For this semester, we're actually offering the course

327
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,299
to see MewQ students.

328
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,259
So welcome to thank you for joining us.

329
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,819
And I realize there's a time zone difference.

330
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,819
And so we will have a regularly scheduled office hour

331
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,939
that lines up with your working hours

332
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,980
with a different TA each week.

333
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,899
I'm not on the system.

334
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,580
Piazza will be in that way at least talk to somebody

335
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,700
if you need to.

336
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,659
And then if you need to talk to your gym

337
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,100
and ask them myself, you know, we'll

338
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,700
post how to schedule calls with us at different times.

339
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
As it has needed.

340
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,580
Again, so this morning session or whenever

341
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,379
it will be for the CMEQ students,

342
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,019
we ask the regular, the Pittsburgh senior students

343
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,420
not to do that.

344
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,980
And by all means, please always have questions.

345
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,180
Post some Piazza right away.

346
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,060
Because you'll get an answer sooner.

347
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,180
Hopefully that way.

348
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,500
I guess I'm in the late policy for homework.

349
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,979
It's used 10 points every hour.

350
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:35,379
It's my first late.

351
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,099
And then the four ideas I'm talking about

352
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:42,379
will be only the applicable to four projects.

353
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,819
If there's a medical emergency, there's some kind of,

354
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,739
it's a extreme circumstances, the term that the senior

355
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:50,419
like to use.

356
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,659
So medical emergency, family emergency,

357
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,939
if you need an extension, please

358
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,740
email instructors as soon as possible.

359
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,220
And that way we can make sure we make

360
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,740
the appropriate accommodations.

361
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,260
If necessary, you may need to go through the medical thing,

362
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,100
go through the health health of us.

363
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,700
But email us sooner rather later.

364
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Like, can't be friends with us, but like,

365
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,820
it's not good to be a district ever 10 years, 10 weeks.

366
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,700
And then you come back to any extent.

367
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,980
If soon as you know something's up,

368
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
we're here to help just a lot of us now.

369
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
OK?

370
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Hi, I got to say this every year.

371
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,660
Do not plagiarize.

372
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,419
So all the homeworks, all the projects

373
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,860
must be your own original work.

374
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,100
Do not group assignments.

375
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,459
You can discuss your projects with students.

376
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,779
That's fine.

377
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,699
You can be in flesh out ideas on the whiteboard,

378
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,059
but do not copy source bit from other people.

379
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,100
Do not copy source bit from GIPO.

380
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,500
So again, because we make this public to people outside CMU,

381
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,459
there's a lot of implementations from previous semesters

382
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,699
from that are available in GIPO.

383
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,860
ChatTPT might be able to even do earlier projects.

384
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,539
Do not copy them because we use Grayscope now.

385
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,259
Grayscope has a play-diner checker.

386
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,899
And basically what we do is we find all the GIPO

387
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,899
implementations from non-seemew students,

388
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,220
load them up into GIPO.

389
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,460
I'm talking to Grayscope, I'd say students,

390
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,940
and then see whether you match against them.

391
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,220
Do not copy your source code from other students.

392
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,139
Do not copy source code from GIPO.

393
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,019
I'd say else too.

394
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,860
The GIPO source code is usually pretty crappy.

395
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,940
We've done experiments before.

396
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,500
She has done this.

397
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,539
The CMU students crush the non-seemew students.

398
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,939
So it's actually in your best interest

399
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,059
not to copy them.

400
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,819
Again, there won't be any exceptions.

401
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,019
Oh, I didn't know.

402
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,379
The fact that this is recorded lecture,

403
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,059
if we have to report you to Warner Hall,

404
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,059
we point to this timestamp in the lecture

405
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,139
and say where I'm warning you, not to plagiarize.

406
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,659
And then you plagiarize.

407
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,860
And now you're screwed.

408
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,620
If there's something you want to do that seems kind of like

409
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,659
Graysome, and you don't want this OK,

410
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,620
like using ChatTPT or something like that, right?

411
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,980
Please email myself in Jignesh, not the TAs to see whether,

412
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
you know, see whether we want to discuss it.

413
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,820
And then the link there will be for CMU's policy

414
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,100
or an academic integrity.

415
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,340
Again, we take this very seriously.

416
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,059
Don't f*** around.

417
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,660
All right, one last thing is that if you love

418
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,700
database as much as I do, and you're

419
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,859
going to go beyond the course material,

420
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,579
we are offering a seminar series this semester.

421
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,619
It's entirely optional.

422
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,019
Where every Monday starting in September,

423
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,019
we're having a different outside speaker

424
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,420
come give a talk about the various databases

425
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,819
you have company or project.

426
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,420
So this semester, the theme is machine learning

427
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,500
for databases and database machine learning.

428
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,700
And so we have people that are building a lot of these hot

429
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,900
thing now, these vector databases,

430
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,500
with all this stuff next class.

431
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,460
But we're having them talk about their systems

432
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,819
how to export LLM, like stuff inside of data systems.

433
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,779
And then we'll have people talk about how

434
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,460
they're using machine learning to optimize database systems.

435
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,819
I use them to make the system actually with the faster.

436
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,259
So again, this is optional.

437
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,059
Everything will be on Zoom.

438
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,619
Monday's at 4.30, and then we'll post it on YouTube afterwards.

439
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,460
Again, in this one, you don't have to be a CMU's tonight.

440
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,259
Or you can join it if you're a digitalist here

441
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,700
at the full schedule.

442
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,899
All right, so that's it for the LLM.

443
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,779
I got to figure out what we're going to do about Mushu.

444
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,500
He's not getting it now.

445
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
And then we'll begin right out of the gate, not taking any logistics.

446
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
But of course, we'll just immediately

447
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,259
talk about the relational model and the databases.

448
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:21,420
All right, guys.

449
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
See you next week.
