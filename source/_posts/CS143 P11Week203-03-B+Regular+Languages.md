00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Well, we've come to the end of this video and to summarize, we looked at regular expressions,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,759
which are used to define regular languages.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,280
And the regular expressions are syntax.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,679
That's the expression that we write down.

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,080
And it denotes a set of strengths, which is the regular language.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,480
And that's the meaning of the regular expression.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
And there are five kinds of regular expressions in the standard definition.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,400
There's an expression for the empty string.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
And that's denoted by epsilon.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,679
And then we have all the one character strings.

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,120
And then there are three compound expressions, ways of building new regular expressions

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,600
from other regular expressions.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,640
And these are union, concatenation, and iteration.
