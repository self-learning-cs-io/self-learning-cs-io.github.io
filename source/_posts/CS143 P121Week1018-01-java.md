1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
In the next several videos, we're going to apply what we've learned in the class to

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,300
analysis of various features of Java.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,200
This will give us a chance to both look at a real programming language and how its design

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,580
has been done and also to talk about some features that aren't in cool that we haven't

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,100
been able to cover thus far in the course.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,300
From the perspective of this class, Java is a kind of cool on steroids.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,460
It's cool plus more features, many more features.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,560
At their core, Java and Cool are very similar.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,200
Java and Cool are both typed, object-oriented, garbage-collected languages.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,600
They were both designed in the early 1990s and so they share a common culture there with

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,040
the ideas that were current at that time.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,400
In this video, I'm just going to give a little bit of the history of Java, so that would

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,640
be the focus really of this rather short video.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
Then in the subject of videos, we'll talk about all the features or some of the features

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,400
of Java that are not in cool and we'll use the ideas of course that we've been discussing

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,799
all on through the class to explain a little bit about those ideas.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,599
I think these are all important language constructs that unfortunately were too time-consuming

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,840
or too complicated to add to the course project.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,319
I think it's useful to use a language like Java to illustrate how these ideas work and

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,039
what some of the issues are.

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:38,819
Java began as a project called Oak at Sun Microsystems and it was originally targeted at

22
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:40,839
set-top devices.

23
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,839
What was a set-top device?

24
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:47,239
This was a little box that was going to sit on top of your TV, so you had your TV screen

25
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,879
and then there was going to be this little thing up here that was going to sit on top

26
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,639
of the TV and it was going to control all your cable programming.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,200
This essentially would connect to some kind of a network and it would help you to make

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
your TV more interactive.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,280
This is back in the days before every TV was really a computer by itself.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,719
The initial development of Oak took several years.

31
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,800
I believe the project ran for about 91 to 94.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,599
What happened, at least as I understand it, is that this set-top device market just never

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,400
took off.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,360
This never really became a popular idea with consumers and so it really wasn't limited

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,120
upside or limited potential for Oak at the time.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,200
Then something happened, the internet happened.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,080
Also in the early 90s, the internet revolution was really gathering steam.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,960
Everybody was getting on the internet and it became obvious sometime 93, 94 that there

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,840
was going to be a need for programming languages that really addressed the specific issues

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
on the internet.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,960
In particular, people were very concerned about security and they didn't want to be downloading

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,960
lots of binaries that were from programs written in C and passing those around on the internet

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,240
because it was just really no guarantee that those programs would work as intended and

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
crash your machine.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,319
You need to be able to share code over the internet from other people that you didn't necessarily

46
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,759
trust completely meant that we needed safer languages than languages like C and C++.

47
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,479
There was an opportunity there for a new language and there were several candidates.

48
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:47,960
Besides Java, Tickle and Python were very serious candidates to become the internet programming

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
language.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Eventually, the backing of Sun Microsystems, the backing that Sun gave to Java, helped

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,920
it to really gain a very, very strong presence on the internet.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,400
But the point of this story is that every new language needs a killer app.

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,879
Every programming language rides into the world on the back of some application.

54
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,400
There has to be some kind of new application that people want to write that the existing

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,159
languages don't serve very well.

56
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:26,159
That provides the opportunity for the makes it worthwhile for people to learn a new programming

57
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,159
language.

58
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:30,000
The fact that Java was a very safe language, it had the garbage collection, it had the

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,399
type system, that made it well suited at the time to the emerging needs of internet programming

60
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:45,079
and it became very popular, I think, primarily because of that reason.

61
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,680
If you recall, there was a lecture or a video early on on the economy of programming languages.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,079
I would recommend that if you haven't watched that one, you go back and take a look because

63
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:04,079
there I discuss some of these ideas about how languages are adopted in more detail.

64
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,560
Java also came into existence in a particular technical environment and it's very common.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,079
It's normal for new programming languages to borrow heavily from their predecessors and

66
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,000
new languages are often mostly recombinations of ideas from previous languages in a new

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,959
design, perhaps with some innovations thrown in.

68
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,319
The particular influence is on Java.

69
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,360
Again, this is at least as far as I understand it.

70
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,000
The type system in Java, or it's commitment to types, probably is traceable to module

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,240
three and the idea is there where people try to build a programming language that would

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,280
scale in a realistic way to large systems but also be strongly typed.

73
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,920
The object orientation of Java is traceable to languages like Objective C and C++ and

74
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:08,120
also Eiffel which also had the idea of interfaces which is a prominent feature in Java.

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,680
Finally, Java is quite a dynamic language meaning that there are many things that are not

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,160
done statically, they're done dynamically so features like Reflection would be one example

77
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,120
of that and there are actually quite a few other features.

78
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,400
There's some history there, there's some shared culture there with Lisp which was a functional

79
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:33,399
family language but is also a very dynamic language.

80
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,199
As I said at the beginning, this video is just an introduction and overview and in the

81
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,159
next few videos we'll be looking at specific features of Java and how they work and that

82
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:48,359
will include things like exceptions, interfaces and threads as well as a bunch of other features

83
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,919
that we'll discuss at least briefly.

84
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,319
One thing to realize is that Java is a big language, it is not simple.

85
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,920
The language manual for Java runs to hundreds and hundreds of pages, it has lots of features

86
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,920
and perhaps more importantly lots of feature interactions.

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,800
The hard part of designing a language of course is getting all the feature interactions

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,680
right, all the combinations of the features and making sure there are no surprising interactions

89
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
between them.
