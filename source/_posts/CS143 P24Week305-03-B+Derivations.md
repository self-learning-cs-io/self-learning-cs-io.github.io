1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So to summarize, we're not just interested in whether a string is in the language of a particular context free grammar.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We need to have a parse tree for that string.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And a derivation defines a parse tree.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it turns out that one parse tree in general has many derivations.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And in particular, we're interested in the left most and right most derivations.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These are the two kinds of derivations that are important in parser implementations.
