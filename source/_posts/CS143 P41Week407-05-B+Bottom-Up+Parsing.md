00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So to summarize, a bottom-up parser traces out a right most derivation in reverse, and it builds a parse tree by combining small parse trees into larger ones.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It proceeds bottom-up instead of expanding out from the start symbol top-down, it builds from the leaves of the tree up towards the root.
