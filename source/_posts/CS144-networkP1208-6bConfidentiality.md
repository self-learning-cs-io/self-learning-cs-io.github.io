00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
So here's our first quiz. You generate a perfectly random key K. You send two messages,

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,519
M1 and M2, encrypted with a one-time pad algorithm. So C1 is equal to K XOR M1, and C2 is equal

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:25,000
to K XOR M2. The sending C2 leak information about M1 and M2.
