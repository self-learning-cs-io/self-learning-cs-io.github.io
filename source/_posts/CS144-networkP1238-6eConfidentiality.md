1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's a second quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose I decide I want to make bluefish faster and so cut it to just one iteration.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I feed it to plaintextblocks.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The first plaintext block is all zeros, which somehow my adversary knows.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It produces the first ciphertext shown here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I feed the second ciphertext block, which produces the second ciphertext shown here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What is the value of L0 in the second plaintext block?
