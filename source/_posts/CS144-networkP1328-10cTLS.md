that will take at most 2 to the 368 attempts.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,120
The two random values are known by an adversaries that are sent in clear text.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,839
The one true secret is the premaster secret, which is 46 bits long.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
If the adversary can guess this value, then it can recompute the master secret using the

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,559
pseudo-random function. With the master secret, it can recompute the keys.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
2 to the 368 is anonymous.
