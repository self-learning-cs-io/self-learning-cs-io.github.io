1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here I'm with John Peterson,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,360
who's an old friend of mine,

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,759
and actually a pretty important person in the internet.

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,080
I thought we'd, and so you could,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,240
you could sort of ask John a bit about what's going on today,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
some particularly interesting topics,

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,679
but maybe she'd start with,

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,000
so how did you get involved in internet governance?

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,000
That's a good question.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,120
So I was lucky enough to be around

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,400
in the Verde.com boom in the late 1990s,

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,199
and a small startup that I worked for in Boston

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,719
was acquired by level three communications.

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,560
They moved me out to Scenic Boulder, Colorado,

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,519
where Phil actually was as well,

16
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,280
and it all roughly the same time.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,000
And level three, of course,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,560
is one of the two one background providers of the internet,

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
and they have a profound engagement

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
with the internet engineering task force

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,840
with the standard bodies that helped make the internet

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,560
to define how the internet works.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,599
And when I got there,

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
that was one of the things actually that most attracted me

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,880
about this opportunity would be the ability to really work

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
with the top minds who were out there.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,799
And so I started attending the ITF.

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
I've been mailing lists and things like that beforehand,

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,359
but I first started attending when I worked at level three,

30
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,359
and I just found it to be a fascinating community

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,040
that had such intellectual vigor

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,719
that just had so much interest in trying to find

33
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,400
the right solution.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,960
You don't go to the ITF and represent a company,

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,840
you go there and you put forward what you think

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
is the best idea, and it's really a place

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
where there is a meritocracy of ideas.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,560
And once you get the bug for it, of course,

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,400
you discover there are all of these other dimensions

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
to make sure that governance,

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,520
if you're there at the ITF,

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,719
you may end up dealing with the W3C,

43
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,040
if you work on applications,

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,320
if they have responsibility for the standards

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,280
of save at the world wide web, like HTML,

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,640
you may end up working with ICANN,

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,719
with the people that do domain name assignments,

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,280
and I kind of made the rounds of these

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
in government circles,

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,920
and working on the intersection between technology

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
and public policy tends to take you

52
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,159
to some pretty interesting places.

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,840
Well, so I think some of the first work that you did

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,080
with SIP, the session initiation protocol.

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Do you want to talk a little bit about this IPs left and E

56
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,719
and kind of what that path was,

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,400
and sort of where SIP is today in your part?

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
And it was?

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,159
Some point I remember that in the early 1990s,

60
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,000
there really wasn't anything like voice of a IP,

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
but there were some experimental technologies

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,800
people had rigged up that worked in some of the Unix

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,280
environments in labs in California and so on,

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
but there was no commercial product you could buy

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
that would let you talk to somebody else

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
over the internet.

67
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,680
Remember as well that in the mid 1990s,

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,520
a lot of computers didn't have adequate sound cards,

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
or certainly wasn't adequate video capture,

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
and network interfaces were spotty at best,

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,680
and the actual commercial services you could purchase,

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,000
especially at the consumer level,

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
to get enough bandwidth to communicate over the internet

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,280
something like voice of a IP, they didn't really exist.

75
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,160
So sometime around 1996, 1997, we'd hit a sweet spot

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,760
where the computing power was there,

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,719
the network was there, computers tended to have

78
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,120
the right interfaces to do this,

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,800
and so we started to see the first commercial voice of a IP

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
offering around that time.

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,160
When I started working on this around then, 96, 97,

82
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,600
I worked on the infrastructure dimension of this,

83
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,960
the startup that I worked for in Boston was focused

84
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,520
on the particular problem of how you could take

85
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
a traditional telephone switch,

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,080
and these telephones which is made by companies like Nortel

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,439
and the time Hussainte, they were a noravis expensive,

88
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,320
monolithic, special purpose devices,

89
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,799
that required a ton of operational oversight,

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,039
it didn't really fit into the internet software model

91
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,079
or the internet disruptive innovation

92
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,400
that we all associate with technology today.

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,039
And so I was one of the first people to work on something

94
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,280
called soft switching, the idea that you could just take

95
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
a general purpose computer, take a sunbox, a unique box,

96
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,319
and put the control plane logic for a telephone switch

97
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,639
on a box like that, and just have it control telephone

98
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,439
resources that actually handled switching

99
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,800
little circuits from one customer to another

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,919
to handle those as dumb devices.

101
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,919
And this created an extremely disruptive influence

102
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,519
on the telephone switch market.

103
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,360
And today, I think it'd be safe to say

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,319
that it's become dominant paraglimant

105
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,000
that you actually can't really buy things like these

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,560
Nortel switches anymore except on the secondary market.

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,159
If you own one and you need replacement parts today,

108
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,399
you pretty much have to get them on you pay.

109
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,560
If you need new line parts and things like that.

110
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,120
Now, once you build a soft switch,

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,439
naturally these sunboxes or other Phoenix boxes,

112
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,879
they have internet access.

113
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,239
And you need to have ways for these switches

114
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,959
to talk to one another to be able to coordinate calls

115
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,319
that don't use the outdated X25 based SS7 systems

116
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,839
they're used in the traditional telephone network.

117
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,039
And that's where tools like SIP start

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,879
get to come into play.

119
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,919
So a lot of my early work on the session initiation

120
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,720
protocol was on to left your replacement,

121
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,800
was on how you would be able to not touch

122
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
that traditional network.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,160
But instead do all of this over the internet

124
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,520
to be able to set up calls at the end.

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,680
And this started to be an important dimension

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
of adopting voice and right-of-peer protocol.

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,160
It's one thing to build a tool that lets you talk to anybody else

128
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,840
who happened to have a good computer, right?

129
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,080
In the 1990s and similar technology that you had.

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
But very different manner to be able to call someone

131
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
who's actually on the telephone network

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
with a real telephone number.

133
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,760
And these soft switches became bridges

134
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,320
between the traditional telephone network

135
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
and people in the voice-spray-piece space.

136
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,920
That these have been essential going forward.

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,120
How voice-spray-piece becomes successful to the ability

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,960
for programs like St. Skype today to call out from your PC

139
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,520
to someone who has a normal landline platform.

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Also, one of the things that you worked on

141
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,160
into the more refined versions of SIP

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
was its security model.

143
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,479
How do you actually secure the SIP one protocol?

144
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,120
So as I'm sure you can imagine, given some of the recent events

145
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,719
in the internet with respect to SIP Snowden releases.

146
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:22,719
This is sort of an interesting question.

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,560
What does DCCM something about the implications

148
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,919
of stuff like SIP and security with respect to then PSTN,

149
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,279
like wire topping laws, all those kinds of questions?

150
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,959
If where do you think this is going or how is it different?

151
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,519
Well, big question.

152
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes.

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
I do recall when we were building the DRFC for SIP Bob

154
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,280
or SIP 3261, we basically kind of drew straws

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,199
for who's going to do what parts.

156
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,360
I got to write the overview of how SIP operated

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,439
the one paragraph state that I got to do addressing.

158
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,600
I got to do user agent behavior.

159
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,879
And then I drew the straw to do security.

160
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,720
That's the problem.

161
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,600
OK, I have a bit of a security background.

162
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
I just should be too difficult.

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,639
And the initial plan, one section on security and SIP,

164
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,639
actually end up being four chapters.

165
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,719
The DRC.

166
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,240
And at the time, it was with the largest DRC

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
I've published, accepted to not come out then.

168
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,039
And SIP security has always been a problem, tribal.

169
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,719
And these revelations obviously

170
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,439
have put the IT app and people who develop standards

171
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,719
in very interesting position.

172
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,279
No less authority than Bruce Schneier, who I would say,

173
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,360
is one of the greatest minds thinking today about security

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,319
has formally called on the IT app to drop what it's doing

175
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,280
and to refocus all of its efforts

176
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
and are upcoming meeting with the NB Vancouver,

177
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
this November, on how we're going to resolve the problems

178
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,360
that have been raised by Prism.

179
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,120
And we've studied the privacy properties

180
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,240
of these protocols, the security properties

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,000
of these protocols very extensively.

182
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,199
I'm as convinced now, I think, as I ever was,

183
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,480
that we made a lot of compromises in the design of SIP security

184
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,000
because they were necessary for it to be adopted in the marketplace.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,720
It would be great to be able to design a protocol that had

186
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,560
and then security that can guarantee integrity and confidentiality

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,600
between one point is trying to make a call,

188
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,759
another endpoint that's trying to make a call.

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,920
As soon as intermediaries are playing some role

190
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,800
in the delivery of that, as soon as they need to help you

191
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,720
to find the right endpoint.

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,720
And this dynamic capability that SIP has to allow,

193
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,319
if I wanted to have five devices that would all register

194
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,759
under my Sydney, my desk phone,

195
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,919
a cell phone, my iPad, various other devices,

196
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,240
they only register to some server that isn't in network somewhere

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,559
that's going to be responsible for routing traffic to it.

198
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,639
The degree to which that server has access to signaling

199
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,199
has access to who's calling main.

200
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,439
What are the media streams that are going to be set up

201
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:07,919
and what are the IP endpoints that media is going to be sent

202
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,759
between?

203
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:15,439
We could have done more to protect that going design SIP.

204
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:20,000
And I think if we had, we wouldn't be talking about SIP right now

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,679
because it wouldn't have succeeded enough

206
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,559
for it to even be known for a thing.

207
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,399
Also, where is something we can talk a little bit about?

208
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,519
So SIP might be a protocol that most people don't realize

209
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,159
they're using or where it's getting used.

210
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,000
Wanna talk a little bit about where it's been successful

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
and where it's been related?

212
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,279
Sure.

213
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,279
So I mentioned Skype.

214
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
If you do Skype Interstugged Out typically,

215
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
that is Skype's internal protocols converted

216
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,239
for, converted into SIP for transfer to a gateway,

217
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,039
which would then go to the telephone network.

218
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:52,319
Basically, if you use a voice-by-p service

219
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
or a landline in your house that comes from either FIOs

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
or from a cable provider, that's surely

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
set that has been used in the background.

222
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,400
The third generation cell phones, things that are 3G-PK-based,

223
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,840
all use SIP Syncaling inside them.

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,920
Now, I mean, these networks, especially

225
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,400
when we talk about mobile phones and about the network

226
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,960
tree seeding and the cable NSOs and so on,

227
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,960
they use a version of SIP that is relatively architecturally

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
similar to the telephone network.

229
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,799
They apply the protocol machinery of SIP

230
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,120
to generating a system that has many of the same properties

231
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,079
that the telephone network has.

232
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,839
And this too is, it's a fundamental tree

233
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,000
off as I have these things.

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,919
So I would love to see a SIP that was much less dependent

235
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,319
on the network elements shaping traffic and deciding

236
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,759
how it was much more driven by the endpoints.

237
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,480
This is just kind of fundamental and then principle

238
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,959
of the internet that you want to have

239
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,600
the smarts be on the endpoints.

240
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,920
You don't want to have an intermediary in the middle

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,400
of me to understand what endpoints wanted to.

242
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,160
It shouldn't get in their way.

243
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,280
It shouldn't prevent them from negotiating.

244
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,120
If I made up a great new code act tomorrow,

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
and I have a copy of it, and you have a copy of it,

246
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
but since it's our G-wishings, I don't love that thing

247
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
in the middle of the network.

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
I have to know anything about that code act

249
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,840
until I have to connect and to use it.

250
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,280
The reality is, though, of how these things actually

251
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,400
get implemented, especially when you're doing something

252
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,879
that's complex as replacing the telephone network,

253
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,240
replacing a more than a century old system

254
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,439
with its reliability constraints,

255
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:29,120
with its emergency services implications,

256
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,559
the ability to call 911.

257
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,799
Just getting the basic services people associate

258
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,039
with this right, it requires you to make compromises.

259
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,759
And I can't say I'm always proud and retrospective

260
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,639
to compromises we needed to make in order

261
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,720
for this to be successful, but I do acknowledge

262
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,440
and retrospect that if we had pushed back

263
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,240
on some of those compromises, it certainly would have led

264
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
to the death of a protocol.

265
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
And then as people who design standards,

266
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,279
this is a heartbreaking thing that you come out against

267
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,279
again and again.

268
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,600
Now, we can be smarter about this.

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,800
And I think if there's a silver lining

270
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,040
to these increasingly disturbing revelations,

271
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,480
they're coming up about widespread state surveillance

272
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,399
of the internet, it may create a political will

273
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,120
to see a change in what we can get consensus for.

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,159
And hopefully, and what people will be willing to deploy.

275
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,399
I believe when you go to the ITX, since it is consensus-based,

276
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,799
there are things we could get consensus to do

277
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,639
that I think would be very radical at this point,

278
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,879
because the people who go to the ITF are still well informed,

279
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,919
they're so energized, they're so interested

280
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,439
in individual liberties.

281
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,199
I would hate to see the ITF though,

282
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,759
become an organization that is developing standards

283
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,039
that never seem a lighted day because it

284
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,079
is one, two-flaw in this direction.

285
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,279
And so it's very difficult for us to understand

286
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,439
what the right course is for us to chart this point.

287
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,199
Interesting.

288
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,199
Interesting.

289
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,399
Well, I'd like to wind back a little bit.

290
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,000
Where you mentioned about how building, sort of,

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,279
the first soft switch where devices and all the logic

292
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,159
is in the digital first computer, at that point,

293
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,799
pretty hardens from the sun box.

294
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,639
But do you see a parallel between that

295
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,599
and then softer to find networking today,

296
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
or do you see that transition may be happening in the internet?

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Is there also some of them that

298
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,159
would occur in behind this, yeah?

299
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,240
I mean, I certainly see many parallels there.

300
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm not sure those parallels will play out

301
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,560
in exactly the same way, because the companies like Cisco

302
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,200
and Juniper that would stand to be disrupted by this,

303
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,480
the way that say, Rochelle and Lucent were in the 90s,

304
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,040
they are more agile companies.

305
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,960
They are companies that are taking these technologies

306
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
and trying to figure out

307
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,400
a middle path, I guess.

308
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
For example, there is the I2RS, the interface

309
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
to the routing system,

310
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
standard proposal circulating in the ITF.

311
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Now, it's a bit different than the very low layer software

312
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,320
to find that approach that we see,

313
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,360
saying on the other networking foundation,

314
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,440
but it's nonetheless a way that software can interact

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
with the fit and with help, you know,

316
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,200
higher level routing decisions get made.

317
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,200
And, you know, I think the routing vendors view this

318
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,120
as one tool among many that will help decide how

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,840
packets are going to be forwarded.

320
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,240
They're figuring out ways, in other words,

321
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,320
to subsune this that will allow their device

322
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
to take advantage of the strengths of this

323
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,759
without necessarily eroding the market control in it.

324
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,200
And they'll lengthy install base they have,

325
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,080
love maintenance tools and so on,

326
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,840
that have proven so successful through that internet

327
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,680
in the past.

328
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,520
I don't know that core routers have to the degree

329
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,120
that old telephone switches did,

330
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,840
impeded innovation in the network as well.

331
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,320
And that was another real driver for doing soft switching

332
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,759
was that these traditional telephone switches

333
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,560
were so model that they had no programmability.

334
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
There were no realistic interfaces that you could use

335
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,960
to alter their behavior without doing open-heart surgery.

336
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,720
I think situation is very different,

337
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,360
I think for core routers, but the parallels,

338
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,920
I mean, they do stand.

339
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,640
I certainly wouldn't dismiss it on a hand.

340
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,360
And I certainly know people who work for major router vendors

341
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,560
who you find them at the bar at the right hour

342
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,240
will cry on your shoulder,

343
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,800
not exactly, you know, their concerns about this.

344
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
It is a real challenge for that business.

345
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,959
Well, so if you were to look at all the different pieces of work,

346
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,519
and so how many working groups are in the ATF today?

347
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,319
I'll top my head, I'm not sure I could say.

348
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,519
Or the order 100, yeah.

349
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,559
Well, so if you were to think,

350
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,759
what's the sort of suggest to somebody,

351
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,279
hey, this is maybe something you should keep your eye on

352
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,039
is what I think is some of the most interesting work

353
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,039
going on in the internet.

354
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,840
So stuff which is currently in progress

355
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,279
and might really significantly change what the network's like

356
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
in three or three years.

357
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Where would you suggest looking?

358
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
Not good luck to that ITU, our S group would be

359
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,759
a very significant one that I've been to right now.

360
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,120
There is a new effort that's just been spun off.

361
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,279
It's unclear if it's going to be a working group or not.

362
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,240
It's called Purpass, which is the ITF's forum

363
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
for discussing prism.

364
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,639
And for discussing how the security things

365
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,600
are going to be addressed,

366
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,079
there are already some proposals that are circulating there

367
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,839
that are really about structural changes

368
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,360
to how the ITF process would work.

369
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,200
For should standards have to be the new bar basically

370
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,960
in order to obviate the very real concerns

371
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,920
that are increasingly coming to light about all of this.

372
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
If you were coming to Vancouver this time,

373
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
these are two things I certainly come to.

374
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,160
There are things I personally happy to be working on.

375
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,200
I think they're very interesting and impactful

376
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,680
that might not essentially exactly that level,

377
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,159
but I continue to be very interested in CDNs

378
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,679
and the degree of internet traffic that is now being

379
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,279
directed by content distribution networks.

380
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,119
We're doing a lot of work today on interfaces

381
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,359
for understanding how CDNs can express their coverage areas

382
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,359
and how CDNs can advertise services that they provide

383
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:20,559
in order to allow collaboration or clearing houses

384
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,639
among CDNs to make more optimal selections

385
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
of CDNs.

386
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
I think this will have potentially a tremendous impact

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,759
on the efficiency of internet traffic

388
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,520
or alleviate some of the bottlenecks

389
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,800
that people protect as more and more video

390
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,360
who's onto the internet.

391
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
That's a personal pet project of mine.

392
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,240
I am also still working on some things related to

393
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
the intersection of the telephone network

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,040
and the internet.

395
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,800
One thing that's been, I think a major issue

396
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,759
in global calling has become an increasing problem

397
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,000
as the internet and the telephone network

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
have become more interconnected.

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,039
And right now I'm looking at ways that perhaps we can do

400
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,599
better identity services.

401
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,559
So it's harder to spoof calls.

402
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,759
It's easier to find out who's responsible

403
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,960
for a telephone call coming off the internet

404
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,639
before it hits the PSTN.

405
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,799
As the numbers for this are just going up and up and up

406
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,480
and the FTC and the FTC are profoundly interested

407
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,799
in finding a solution for this.

408
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
This is worth it is being discussed

409
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,079
in congressional subcommittees already

410
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,480
as it's going on in the ITF.

411
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,079
So that's another place where I think we can really

412
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,279
make a difference.

413
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,079
And something that is hurting consumers

414
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,480
and we'll be a big deal going forward.

415
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,839
So if we stop pursuing real close

416
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,240
then we have you to thank.

417
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,079
Okay, thank you.

418
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,480
Great, well thanks for going by.

419
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,680
Thanks for your time.

420
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,879
No much pleasure.

421
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,159
Yeah, thank you.

422
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:47,960
Bye.
