1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So I'm here today with Reed Hunt, who is best known for being at the chairman of the FCC

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,080
during the Clinton administration in the mid 1990s. It was a very exciting time for development

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,039
of communications. There was telecommunications act. There was a huge growth of the internet

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,379
leading up to the internet bubble at the end of the 1990s. There was the beginnings of

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,460
auctions of spectrum. Reed was a time of very rapid change. So it's a real pleasure and

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,179
delight to have Reed Hunt here with us today. I read how you doing. Good, good to be with

7
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:48,259
you Nick and good to be with your 39,000 students. So Reed has been very involved in the last

8
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:55,280
few months of raising the debate and asking many questions about the very controversial

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,600
topic of data privacy, government tapping, government eavesdropping on citizens, and all

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,359
of the things related to the Snowden leaks and the NSA. So it's very relevant and very

11
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,319
timely to be able to have Reed talk with us today. So Reed, I just wanted to ask you a very

12
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,680
first to start with, really a more general question. Many of the students that are watching from

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,640
outside the United States and perhaps don't know what the FCC is, the Federal Communications

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,120
Commission and what they do, what their responsibilities are. Can you just give us an overview of what

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,120
the FCC is responsible for? You bet. The Federal Communications Commission is what in the

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,280
United States we call an independent regulatory agency. The year five commissioners, one of

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,280
them is the chair. I was the chair because Bill Clinton picked me among the commissioners

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,519
to be a chair in 1993. It is independent of the executive branch, meaning the president

19
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:04,879
cannot tell the FCC what to do. It gets its powers from the legislature, but once it has

20
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:12,400
those powers, it regulates and the only check and balance on the regulation comes from

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,000
the courts because companies, individuals can challenge the regulations and say that they're

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,159
illegal or they're unconstitutional and can take the issue to the court. So the Federal Communications

23
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,080
Commission as an independent regulatory agency is quite a bit different than the regulatory

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,480
agencies in many, many other countries for two respect and two reasons. Number one, in many

25
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,919
other countries, the regulatory agencies do report to the executive branch. And second, in many

26
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:54,479
other countries, many parts of the communications industry are owned by the government in whole

27
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:02,519
or in part as is the case in China, as is the case in Germany, as is in the case of France and

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,320
other countries. So in the US, we don't have government ownership of the information communications

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,920
and technology sector with a few very, very minor exceptions. There are some small towns that

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,240
own their own telephone companies. And we have a regulatory agency that is independent of the rest

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,520
of government. By far, the Federal Communications Commission is the most powerful regulatory agency

32
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,520
for the information communications and technology sector in the United States and relative to all

33
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:47,879
of the regulators in the world in this sector. It is by far the most powerful agency. So during the 1990s,

34
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,600
during those times of just enormous change, in every aspect of communication, long distance

35
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,719
telephone communications, deregulation of the industry and the growth of the internet, the

36
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:07,240
auctioning of spectrum, the changing of rules on consolidation of radio stations, of ownership of

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,560
radio stations. They were just massive changes. So what role did the FCC play in that? And to what

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,560
extent did were those changes foreseen and understood? Because they must have meant big changes to the FCC

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:29,240
itself, not only to the policy that it was advocating. So I became the FCC chairman 20 years ago

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:38,680
next month, November 1993, and approximately that was the month that the internet was invented as a

41
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:47,079
commercial matter. Meaning that was approximately when Marc Andrewsons Mosaic Browseur

42
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,040
was exploding across the United States and then the rest of the world. And when everyone saw that

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:04,920
the internet could be used not just for text and not just for fairly academic discourse, but rather

44
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,319
you could get to the internet by plugging in your own personal computer to the telephone network.

45
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,400
And you could download the browser and then with this browser, you could turn your own PC into a

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,520
website and also go to anybody else's website and see pictures or listen to music, then all of a

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,680
sudden really in just the matter of weeks. Everybody in the United States and pretty soon everybody in the

48
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:43,079
world said, holy cow, this is going to completely transform the world. So two things were told to me

49
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:51,000
right away by a whole bunch of people in technology. The first was something said to me by Nicholas

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,840
Nicarapante who then was running MIT Media Labs. He said, you need to understand that everything in

51
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:06,439
communications is backwards. And I said, what do you mean? And he said, well, we use the airwaves

52
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,479
for broadcast television. We use the airwaves for video. Video is lots of data. And the airwaves,

53
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:23,319
as a matter of physics, are really not well suited to carry all that data. And we use lines, copper,

54
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:31,079
we use an underground physical network to carry voice communication. But that's really where the data

55
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:38,279
ought to be, where you have lots of packets to carry because voices hardly any data. So he said,

56
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:45,800
your job at the FCC is to do what I call the Nicarapante switch. You need to have all voice communication

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,800
over the air and all data communication go in physical networks that are terrestrial. So that is a

58
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:01,080
big strategic change. And what he meant in the American system is not that the FCC would order that,

59
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,000
but that it would change all the regulations so that companies that wanted to execute on this great

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,280
switch actually could do so. So they could get spectrum for mobile communications so that they could

61
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,679
build physical networks that interconnected with existing networks so that they could write their

62
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:25,159
content differently so that they could have access to networks for different kinds of content.

63
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:32,039
In a very, very big picture way, that's exactly what we tried to do starting in 1993.

64
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:40,279
And I got to tell you, the FCC was hugely successful in the American tech industry, was hugely successful.

65
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,719
And the American communications industry was also very successful in executing the biggest

66
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:56,279
transformation at scale of any businesses in history, meaning the entire Bell network

67
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:04,199
went from a fixed line voice celebrity network to an over the air mobile communications network.

68
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:12,360
And that represented well more than $100 billion of capital expenditure in a complete transformation

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,399
of every aspect of the way that they were doing business. So that was the big switch.

70
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,680
And then I told you there were two things I was told. Here was the other thing I was told.

71
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,039
And I was told this by Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel,

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,360
and they at the Stanford Park Hotel about 400 meters from where you're sitting right now, Nick.

73
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:43,240
In the beginning of 1994, he said, you need to understand that this is a war. And I said,

74
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:51,159
what do you mean it's a war? And he said, data, packet switch data is the disruptive enemy of

75
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:57,080
circuit switched communication. I'm going to let you make sure that you've taught all your students.

76
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:07,400
Exactly. He said, you need to understand that those who depend on analog communication and

77
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,240
circuit switch technology are going to be relegated to the dustbin of history. And you need to make

78
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,240
sure the government doesn't try to save them that the government makes the way for the winning technology.

79
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:27,639
So we really tried to do that. And that really, really did happen. And there were many losers as a

80
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:35,799
consequence. I'll conclude by giving you the biggest example of a huge loser. By the late 1990s,

81
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:44,440
18T was the dominant long distance company in the United States. And the most powerful international

82
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,680
company in the communications area waving the American flag as its headquarters. More than

83
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,520
$100 billion of market cap, immensely significant in every major city in the world.

84
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,040
Within less than 10 years, its market cap was one tenth of that. And it was sold for a song to

85
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:13,879
SPC, which took its name as 18T. It did not execute on either the switch from circuit to packet,

86
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:25,319
or the move from landline to voice being mobile, or the move to a physical network scaring data

87
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,959
as their dominant motor business. It didn't execute on any of those changes and it was a huge loser.

88
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,800
So if you look at some of the big changes that happened during that time,

89
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
are there some of that if you got to go back and revisit them that you would

90
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,240
that you think should have been handled a little differently?

91
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:56,519
In the United States, no. The information of the communications revolution

92
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:04,519
meant a commitment as a matter of business and as a matter of government to the notion that

93
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,480
there would be winning companies and losing companies. That was a reversal of the traditional

94
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,720
policy which was this. Nobody would win a lot and nobody would ever lose.

95
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:25,000
Another word stability. Another word one big company, a few companies in broadcast,

96
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:32,200
lots of little radio companies, one major newspaper in every city, tremendous stability,

97
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,360
very little innovation, no risk. The communications platform would be like the ground under your

98
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:46,840
feet. It wouldn't ever be subject to the earthquake. It wouldn't ever be at risk. And instead,

99
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,799
we moved to a completely different model. Tremendous upheaval, tremendous challenge for the companies

100
00:11:53,799 --> 00:12:01,240
to change. A willingness to cope with change. And the result was that we had a fantastic economic

101
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:09,799
boom. So there's really nothing about that at the big picture level that I think we should regret.

102
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,919
So one of the consequences of the big change to the internet is that that stability that we saw

103
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,799
that was holding back some of the socketswitch world now has become a stability holding back the

104
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,559
packet switch world. For example, the industry structure around an internet architecture and

105
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:34,279
narrow waste of IP that really has not changed very much over the last 15 or 20 years. In industry

106
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:41,399
structure that has favoured closed, vertically integrated equipment for which the pace of innovation

107
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,799
of the networking equipment itself has been relatively slow, particularly if we compare it to the

108
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:52,359
computer industry as a whole. Now there are changes of foot to break apart some of that vertical

109
00:12:54,359 --> 00:13:00,599
vertical integration and open up interfaces and bring about a more software based

110
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:07,399
rate of innovation in the network infrastructure. Do you think that government and government

111
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,240
regulation has a place to in the, in a sense, the governance and driving of the internet?

112
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, I would say yes and no. So I think you're describing one way to talk about what you're

113
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,039
describing is the difference between a closed and open and another way to talk about it is the

114
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:38,200
difference between horizontal and vertical. So what do we mean by horizontal? Well, the famous

115
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:46,920
writings of Andy Grove in the 1990s about the computer industry all focused on the notion that

116
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,920
the industry was horizontally organized. There would be a chip industry until would be his primary

117
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,759
example and it was indeed without question the most profitable semiconductor business that ever

118
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:07,320
existed. Still is the most profitable semiconductor business that has ever existed. But it did not

119
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,520
move vertical. It did not do the software that is the operating system and it didn't do above that

120
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,400
the application layer and it's similarly if you want to extrapolate to different services that

121
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:28,600
might be provided as versions of delivering on applications until wasn't involved in that. There

122
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,360
would be different companies at each of these layers. There would be competition within the layers

123
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,159
but the layers themselves would cooperate in order to deliver the finished product. That's the

124
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:49,000
horizontal non-vertical model. The great challenge to that is the apple model, right?

125
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,879
Yep, which is we'll just do everything from the bottom to the top and it won't be open to anybody

126
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:02,519
and we may get vendors to provide things but everything will be done will be done our way. If you ask

127
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,840
should the government dictate a horizontal market structure or a vertical market structure,

128
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:16,679
I would say government should really enjoy the battle of the different companies for

129
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:23,159
economic success with different models. There's no obvious reason why government should say one

130
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:29,240
model is better than another model. That's horizontal and vertical. Now let's talk about open and closed.

131
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,919
Open and closed has at least two different meanings. One is the meaning that I think you might

132
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:44,440
apply to standards. For example, let's take the Microsoft operating system.

133
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:52,919
Was that an open system? Well, not really. You had to get permission to design an application for it

134
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,159
and even if you got that permission it would be not open in any way like the Android system.

135
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,120
First, it wasn't open because people would have to pay for access to it. Second, it wasn't

136
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,120
open because it didn't permit a community of innovators to alter it and use it in a particular

137
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,399
manner. So should government speak to that kind of open and closed? Again, I think that's a

138
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,399
question of business model and the government ought to keep its nose out of that. But another

139
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:34,279
meaning of open and closed is were those words apply to what an antitrust lawyer like me would

140
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:45,399
call bottleneck or monopoly power. So take a look, for example, at Google's market share in search.

141
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,759
Any government in the world would say that the 80-90% market share that Google has for search

142
00:16:52,759 --> 00:17:00,840
represents a monopoly market share. And that search engine is not open. Meaning there's nothing

143
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,359
more closed or carefully guarded or kept secret than Google's algorithms for search. And nobody else

144
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,920
on the outside can get access to them and alter them in some particular way. So as to, for example,

145
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:23,240
optimize for searching the works of a unique or my works on the internet.

146
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,960
Great. Now, should government get involved in opening bottlenecks and the answer is sometimes.

147
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:37,480
When those bottlenecks represent monopoly power that is going to be used to fort innovation or

148
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,680
crush competition, that's when government should get involved.

149
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,400
I see. So I'd like to move the conversation a little bit towards more recent events and privacy and

150
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:59,319
matters of security. So as far back as 1994, US Congress passed the communications assistance for

151
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,759
Law Enforcement Act or Calia, which was quite controversial at the time. But it was originally

152
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,640
put there to aid law enforcement and its efforts to conduct surveillance of digital telephone networks.

153
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,519
What was that about? And how did that affect and lay the groundwork for where we are today?

154
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,359
Okay. So just to go back in history, in that time period, approximately 20 years ago,

155
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,519
a voice communication was over these landline networks for the most part, not over cellular,

156
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,639
and certainly not over anything like the internet. It was over these circuit switch networks.

157
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,160
And since almost all voice communication was on those networks, that meant that the actual

158
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,680
communications themselves would be consolidated within the networks of just a few companies.

159
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,680
And they were all regulated by the FCC. They're still regulated by the FCC.

160
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:04,039
So in that time period 20 years ago, it was physically possible to have the government,

161
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,000
either through the FCC or through some other arm of government, go to just a handful of companies

162
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,759
and say, you're going to see all the phone calls in America and most phone calls in the world

163
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,759
are physically going to go through the United States. Even if they're going for China to Europe,

164
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,480
they're probably going to go through the United States. So you're going to see almost all phone

165
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,759
calls in the world. And under certain conditions, we want to eavesdrop on those phone calls.

166
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:39,640
So it was very, it was physically easy. And from a regulatory perspective, it wasn't very intrusive.

167
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,759
The only question in that time period, there were two questions. Question one would be,

168
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,400
would the government have to get a warrant from a court to get access to those calls?

169
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,079
And question two would be, well, who would pay for the eavesdropping? Because it was actually a

170
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:02,519
fairly complex technical matter to do that. Right. And the FBI wanted the FCC to order the phone

171
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:09,240
companies to pay. And I told the FBI, I'm not doing that. You can figure out how to get the phone

172
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,440
companies to pay. I have no idea how you'll do that. But if you can't do that, go to Congress

173
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,200
and get an appropriation and you spend the money. So it may seem a little antiquated, but the

174
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,600
primary debate was about who would get the money to do it. So moving the clock forward to today,

175
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,279
when an internet service provider or even an equipment vendor such as Cisco Juniper,

176
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,519
Alcatel-Lusent, Huawei is building equipment for use by an operator.

177
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,920
Who's responsibility is it to create a technical ability and who pays for the ability to tap

178
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,039
internet communications? Okay. Well, first of all, as far as the who pays part is concerned,

179
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,839
the debate hasn't changed one bit from where it was 20 years ago. So the idea of the different

180
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,279
agencies and government is, well, we don't have any money. So you companies ought to do all the work

181
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,119
of assembling the data. And when you've got it all organized and when you figured out the

182
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:18,359
database and when you've used to do it to get all the unstructured data in some kind of searchable

183
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:25,160
form, we'll just show up and we'll just borrow it. We'll just have access to it. So that's actually

184
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,799
what all the newspaper accounts have said that the American agencies have been doing. They've

185
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:37,399
been letting the companies do all the work of gathering the data and organizing it and storing it.

186
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:42,200
And of course, the companies apparently want to do that for their commercial purposes. And the

187
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,200
government is saying, how about a free ride? You know, we have some national security purposes as well.

188
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:59,159
The thing that has changed is the government is not interested in so much anymore in just the voice

189
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,600
communications, which now are predominantly mobile. It's interested in all this other data

190
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,160
that the over-the-top companies have learned how to gather, which is where am I and what am I saying

191
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,160
on Twitter and what am I saying in emails and what have I saved, what pictures have I taken and

192
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,440
where have I saved those pictures. In other words, what am I doing, what am I thinking? And most

193
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,120
importantly, what predictions can be made about what I'm about to do. All of that, which commercial

194
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,000
companies have perfected so that they can tell advertisers where to advertise. The government is

195
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,440
saying, if you can make those kinds of predictions, then that means you can help us make predictions about

196
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,120
who is about to commit crimes, some of them potentially really hideous.

197
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:55,879
So some of the, to clearly, the over-the-top companies are already collecting large amounts of data

198
00:22:55,879 --> 00:23:01,319
just for the service that they provide. And so there are a right source for that information

199
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:07,719
from lower enforcement and intelligence agencies. But the network equipment, the switches and

200
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:14,199
routers that make up the internet, they too can be, we can eavesdrop into them. There's eavesdropping

201
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:21,240
capabilities that have to be put in anyway just to maintain and have them work. But are the

202
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,600
builders of the equipment are they responsible for? Are they required in any way to provide the

203
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:37,400
means to the back door to be able to listen to communications? Well, if you're asking whether there's a

204
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:47,000
law or a regulation that affects the design of routers or servers or for that matter data centers,

205
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,519
so as to permit back doors, no is the answer to that question, at least in the United States.

206
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:01,000
Is that the regime in China? Well, that's the matter of a tremendous amount of debate and the Chinese

207
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,080
would say no and a lot of other people would say the true answer in China is yes. So you have to ask

208
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:15,480
that question on a country by country basis. I see. It's not, if I may say so, it's not really,

209
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,399
I think, the most important question because of the big fact is that approximately four firms

210
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:29,559
that are headquartered in the United States gather the overwhelming amount of over the top

211
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:37,159
information and they are storing it and organizing it for their own commercial purposes and it's all

212
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:44,679
there for the government to tap into and according to newspaper accounts, we don't, I don't have

213
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:53,000
anything to go by but that the national security agency has persuaded those companies to give access

214
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,319
to the data or according to a story two days ago, they didn't even ask, they just went ahead and

215
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:05,720
got access to the data. Yes, yeah. I mean with hindsight, do you think that the government should

216
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:16,279
have played more of a positive role earlier on to either introduce regulation, for the over the top

217
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:23,799
industries to prevent that, either that consolidation into just four companies or put in place more

218
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:32,279
guidelines on how that data was stored and how much was stored in for a period. Well, I would give

219
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:39,000
no as my answer to both those questions and I would just want to point out for 20 straight years,

220
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,480
the tech industry in the United States and in most other countries but especially in the United

221
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:54,200
States, as vigorously stood for the proposition that the government should really not ever tell it what to do on any

222
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:03,400
topic whatsoever. Right. And the idea that the industry would have said, oh, we could use some regulation about design

223
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,960
and it's really good if the government tells us when it might want to have access to the information,

224
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:22,039
that would have produced a firestorm of opposition and hostility and you have to ask, really what would have

225
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:30,840
been the point? Would anything be different if the government had over the past 20 years regulated

226
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,200
something about the design of the internet? I don't think anything would have been different.

227
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,440
You'd still be facing the exact same questions we're now facing, which really boiled on just one

228
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:52,200
question. So if for example, Google is going to gather all this data, then why shouldn't a national

229
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:00,120
security agency be able to make a prediction about a potential bad actors, bad acts that's just

230
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:06,359
accurate as a prediction Google might make about what advertisers will appeal to that person.

231
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:16,039
Right. So one area where the government seems to have got involved, it's alleged that the national

232
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:21,479
security agency had influenced the data encryption standards to make them weaker and easier for

233
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,640
government to crack. And as a consequence, what do you think the consequences should

234
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,079
will be on the degree to which we trust our networks and the internet in general for our secure

235
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:42,440
communications? And what does it mean for the future of banking and e-commerce? Do you think this

236
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:50,279
will have a long-term detrimental effect? I think that the tech industry has not been able

237
00:27:51,079 --> 00:28:01,639
to design and implement security at any level of the network in a way that's been satisfactory to

238
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:10,440
anybody. So I would agree how hot to leave with that. Right. Probably it would be worth looking at

239
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:19,960
the eBay slash PayPal paper that was just published yesterday, which lays out a vision of the way

240
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:29,000
online monetary system or online payment system actually could work. And you could be you and your

241
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,160
students could be the judge of whether they've got a better idea about security. But I would say this

242
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,680
is a problem that remains to be solved. And unless it is solved in a public-private consensual

243
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,759
matter, then I think the future of the internet is going to be less than it should be.

244
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,960
And what do you think when we're making this interview, it's just a few days after the

245
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,960
the breaking news about the alleged US spying on Chancellor Merkel of Germany. What do you think

246
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,400
the international impact is going to be of these of these revelations?

247
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:19,480
Well, when I first went to China in the late 1990s as a member of the US government, I was advised

248
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:27,160
that it would probably be the case that my hotel room would be entered when I left it and that

249
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:33,560
people in the Chinese government would examine everything they could find there. And if I left

250
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,000
the computer, they would get into the computer and see what they could get out of it.

251
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,159
I would just like to say that they left the room very neatly arranged, but not in the same way

252
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:57,799
that I had left it. And let me go on to say that there's nothing new under the sun. And as long as

253
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,159
there have been people in power, those people in power have wondered what other people in power

254
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,400
were doing and have tried to find that out.

255
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,080
Clearly, the allegations related to the recent allegations of listening into a foreign ally

256
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:23,240
and in Germany with the coast of East Germany, looming large, it has particular implications.

257
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,400
And do you think this will die down over the next few days or weeks? So do you think it'll

258
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,280
actually change the way that we see privacy and the way in which different countries spy on each other?

259
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,280
You know, a lot of people think that the debate here is between privacy and security.

260
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:52,040
If you want to have security for everybody, you need to interfere or impinge on other people's privacy.

261
00:30:52,759 --> 00:31:00,599
My own view, which is shaped by reading a great book by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,

262
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,759
a book called Seekersie, which was published in 1998. My own view is that the real issue is

263
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:17,559
openness and closeness of public and secret. And that almost everything that government does today,

264
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:24,440
which is secret, really ought to be public, not everything, but almost everything.

265
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:31,879
And I don't mean public in the sense of there ought to be constant Twitter feeds of everything

266
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:37,079
the government is finding out, but I do mean that governments everywhere ought to be more open

267
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:45,159
about what they are doing. And if that were the case, then I believe that it would be substantially

268
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:52,120
easier for communities, the citizens of the United States, for example, to form a consensus

269
00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:01,080
about the appropriate limits of security and the appropriate rights of privacy. But the real

270
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,400
enemy of freedom is secrecy. Yeah, and I think that's become very clear in the last few months,

271
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,960
is suddenly we become aware of many things which we may have suspected we're going on, but

272
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,960
they're thrust forward into the public debate. And if nothing else, for sure, the quality of that

273
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,480
debate has improved tremendously in the last few months because of the scrutiny that it's come under

274
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,240
and it's realizing how what a lack of transparency that has been in the past. So I would agree

275
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,200
very much with that sentiment. So if you were in, you know, if you were magically put in the position

276
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:44,680
to be able to sort of take charge, I'm not quite sure of what or of whom, what would be your

277
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,559
desire for how we would get to that place of greater openness and transparency?

278
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:58,759
I think you have to do a number of different things. So for example, in the United States,

279
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:04,519
according to reporters who have gotten access to some of these documents, there are well more than

280
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:12,759
a million people who have a security classification. Well, if it's more than a million people who have it,

281
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:22,119
it's not worth very much. Really, there should be almost no one who has access to the kinds of

282
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:31,240
conclusions that the computers run by the National Security Agency are able to draw about bad actors.

283
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,960
Second, those people should have terms of duty of not more than five years so that we don't

284
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,880
empower by the power of secrets, certain individuals who have immense sway over government and other

285
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:51,880
and people in the private sector. Third, the nature of the information gathered by government ought

286
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:58,279
to be open. Not the details, but the generic categories. They all ought to be known so that everyone

287
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:05,000
understands what the government is doing. Again, not day by day or case by case, but in the abstract.

288
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:15,880
And then fourth, any individual who the government has targeted is going to need to be able to get

289
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:22,119
access if they're charged with a crime where they're prosecuted. They're going to be able to,

290
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,480
they're going to need to get access to the information the government used to target them.

291
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,840
Otherwise, you're having trial by computer and you're having trial by algorithm.

292
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,240
Now, that concept assumes that you're innocent until proven guilty, but it also goes a little further

293
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,720
and says the issue of proof of guilt can't totally be left to the computers and the government.

294
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:55,640
It has to be that the defendant, the accused, also has access to that same information and that same

295
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,039
data bank if the charges are brought. That balance doesn't right now exist in American law.

296
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:11,000
Are you confident, optimistic that the current debate will help move us in that direction?

297
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:19,400
Yes, I am. I think it's been, I think that the news stories have been immensely helpful.

298
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:29,720
I take with the green of salt some of the protestations of foreign leaders who are shocked and shocked

299
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,240
and shocked to find out that they're spying that's been going on. I guess for the first time in

300
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:43,880
history, this has been going on, is there a view? But I think that the overall the revelations are

301
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,039
leading to an open debate about that which ought to be open.

302
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,039
With that, I thank you very much and particularly thank you for

303
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,640
keeping this debate alive and for your participation in it. It certainly helped raise the

304
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,840
quality of the debate and discussion over the last few months. Thank you.

305
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,920
Thank you. Your honor to talk with you about it, Reed. Thank you, Nick. Good to be with you

306
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,360
and all of your, all of your clients.
