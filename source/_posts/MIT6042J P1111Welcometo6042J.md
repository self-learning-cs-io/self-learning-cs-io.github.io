00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,839
This is mathematics for computer science, 6042J, 18062J, a joint subject between electrical

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,899
engineering and computer science and mathematics.

3
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,900
Welcome.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,699
The instructors are Professor Adam Chapala and Professor Albert R. Meyer and I'm Albert.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:25,699
Hiya.

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,100
Quickly summarizing what this course is about, it's about the math that computer scientists

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,820
almost all need regularly and which you're not likely to have come across in your standard

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,939
calculus classes.

9
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,780
You may have seen some of this stuff in high school.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,739
For example, in calculus courses people talk about functions on the real numbers and

11
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,140
sometimes they'll talk about functions on the complex numbers, but computer scientists

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,939
are usually dealing with much more abstract functions on data types and even functions

13
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,820
on functions.

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,620
And I wonder how many of you, if I asked you to define abstractly what a function was,

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,219
could give that definition in a couple of weeks.

16
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:14,659
In this class you'll be able to do that with facility.

17
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,700
We will also be talking about a variety of standard discrete structures starting with the numbers

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
which we think of as a structure because it's the numbers packaged with the operations

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,620
on them like plus and times and exponentiation.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,700
We'll also talk about various other standard graphical data structures like graphs and

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:38,659
trees and we'll look at methods for counting the numbers of these different kinds of data

22
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,340
structures as a typical fundamental problem in computer science where you typically want

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,100
to know how big is the search space.

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,820
For example, the search space of passwords had better be large or a cracker can just search

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,260
through the wall to find one that works.

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,920
And finally we'll talk about discrete probability theory which is simply a version of probability

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,140
theory where we can get by with sums instead of getting into the complications of integrals.

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,140
So here's a quick sanity check or vocabulary check.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,460
Do you know what discrete means?

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
And I'll give you a hint.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,860
It doesn't mean discrete.

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,740
If you don't know, this is a good moment to stop the video and look it up.
