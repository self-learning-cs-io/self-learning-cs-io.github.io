00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay, so how do we find these stable marriages?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,240
Well, there's a procedure for doing it, which is kind of elegantly described as a day-by-day

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,080
mating ritual that the boys and the girls cooperate in.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,280
So let's see what happens on the first day.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,280
On the morning of the first day, each boy looks at his list of girls and picks the one

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,400
that he likes the best at the top of his list.

7
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,199
And he goes off and serenades her or proposes to her.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,839
So here we have Billy Bob and Brad proposing to Angelina.

9
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:39,439
That means that on the first day, Angelina was at the top of both Brad's list and Billy

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,480
Bob's list, and they're both going to be proposing and asking if she's willing to marry

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
them.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,439
Well in the afternoon, each girl rejects all but her favorite suitor.

13
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,480
So in this case, Angelina likes Brad best of all.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
It's not married.

15
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,559
Well, that happens exactly when his list is empty, otherwise he'd be serenading somebody

16
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,799
and be married to her.

17
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,759
But if his list is empty by the invariant, every girl has a suitor that she likes better

18
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,199
than be, which means she's going to be married to somebody that she likes better than be.

19
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,159
Every girl's married, but there are the same number of boys and girls.

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,519
So in fact, given that there's no big of me, all the boys have to be married too.

21
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,159
And that settles that one.

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,799
So the next crucial property that we're interested in is stability.

23
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,000
That in fact, this set of marriages, which must come into being on the wedding day, are

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,479
all stable.

25
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,079
And the argument for stability has two cases, both of them trivial and that follow immediately

26
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,679
from the invariant.

27
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,120
First of all, let's look at an arbitrary boy, Bob.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,160
I claim that he won't be in a rogue couple with case one, any girl G that's on his final

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
list.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,320
Because if a girl is on his final list, then he's already married to the best of them.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,159
He marries the girl at the top of his list.

32
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,319
So he's not going to be tempted to switch to be part of a rogue couple with some girl

33
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,560
that's still on his list.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,000
This too is he's not going to be in a rogue couple with a girl that's not on his list

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,840
because by the invariant, she's married to somebody she likes better than him.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,680
So there's no available girl either way for Bob to be in a rogue couple with Bob of course,

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,920
as an arbitrary boy and therefore no boy is in a rogue couple.

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,000
And indeed, there are no rogue couples.
