00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So stability has some value, but it doesn't mean that everybody's happy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In fact, it just means that nobody can find anybody else who's equally unhappy that they would want to run off with.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's examine the question of how well people do using the mating ritual or in other possible ways of finding stable marriages.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So basically we want to begin with the question of who does better the boys or the girls.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Maybe it's a mixture. Maybe the boys do better, the girls do better, maybe some boys do better than others and some girls do better than others.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And one thing to notice is we know that the girls' suitors are getting better day by day.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that sounds like the mating ritual might be slanted towards them.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Likewise, the boys, sweethearts, the ones that they're serenading are getting worse day by day.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that sounds like it might be an argument for the girls to do better, but that's not true.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And the reason it's not is that if you think about it, the boys are starting off with their first choice.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They begin by serenading the girl at the top of their list.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And it's true the day by day they keep going down or staying the same or going down, but they're only sinking to in fact the best possible woman that they can be married to.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's examine that.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I need a definition which is that we'll say that a woman Nicole is called optimal for Keith when she is the highest ranked girl he can stably marry.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let's think about that for a minute. So Keith has his preference for different girls that he likes to different degrees.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And there may be some that he likes like Keith thinks that Angelina is terrific, but there's just no way that she's going to wind up with him because she just ranks him very lowly.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So there's no stable set of marriages in which Keith can wind up with this very desirable woman Angelina.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But if you look at all of the sets of marriages that are stable that Keith can be involved in among them Nicole is the woman that he most likes.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's what we mean by Nicole is optimal for Keith. She's optimal among the feasible women that he could stably be married to.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And the claim that we're making is that the mating ritual yields a set of stable marriages which is simultaneously optimal for Keith and all the other boys at once.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now that's a kind of unusual thing usually when you're optimizing you figure you optimize for one boy and it sacrifices the optimality for the other boys, but that's not what happens in the mating ritual.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All of the boys get their absolutely optimal spouse in the mating ritual and do a lay it turns out that all of the girls get the worst possible spouse that they can get a personal spouse among all possible stable marriages.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, well with that claim understood let's go about proving it and we're going to prove that the mating ritual leads to boy optimal marriages by contradiction.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So let's suppose that Nicole is optimal for Keith among all the women that's Keith could possibly be married to in a stable way Nicole is the best suppose that Keith does not wind up marrying the call in some in the mating ritual.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, so he doesn't marry Nicole in the mating ritual. That means that he must have since Nicole is is optimal for Keith.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He must be married to somebody that's less desirable to him than Nicole. So he must have crossed Nicole off on some day. Let's call that his bad day.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So on his bad day, Keith is rejected by his optimal spouse.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, among if this ever happens, there's going to be some boy for which who has the earliest bad day, we may as well assume that it's Keith.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So let's assume that Keith was the earliest among the boys to have a bad day. That is a day on which he crosses off his optimal spouse because he was rejected by her.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, on this bad day, when Keith crosses off Nicole, it's because Nicole rejected him, which meant that Nicole had a suitor that she liked better than Keith. Let's call that suitor Tom.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So what we know is that Nicole prefers this guy, Tom, to Keith on the day that she protocols, which are resistant to lying.

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're not going to go into these questions. We mainly want it to understand the stable marriage problem, which had its applications and had a find them.

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Again, if you want to learn more about this, you can look at the book by Gus Field in Irving that I mentioned in a previous video.
