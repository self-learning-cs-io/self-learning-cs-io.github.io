00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
So far we've been talking about running time.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,599
Now we have to talk about the memory requirements of our programs as well.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:14,720
Well, the basics are we want to know how many bits the program use or bytes, eight bits at

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,240
a time.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,679
And actually we'll be talking in terms of millions of bits or billions of bits.

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,920
And actually, surprisingly, there's controversy about even these basic definitions.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,600
Because scientists think of a million bits as 2 to the 20th and a billion as 2 to the 30th,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,480
because that's the number of possible things that you can fit into the 30 bits and everything

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,240
is consistent with our calculations.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,640
Other scientists are accurate.
