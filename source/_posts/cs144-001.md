Welcome to the first unit. This is the unit where you will learn the big picture as well as a few details. You're going to learn the basics of how the internet works. You might even get to figure out which one of us is Nick and which one of us is film. We hope to help you understand why the internet is designed the way that it is. What are some of its strengths and its weaknesses? We'll also teach you some of the commonly accepted network design principles, such as layering, encapsulation, and packet switching. 
欢迎来到第一单元。这是您将学习大局和一些细节的单元。你将学习互联网运作的基础知识。你甚至可能知道我们中的哪一个是尼克，哪一个是电影。我们希望帮助您理解为什么互联网是这样设计的。它的优点和缺点是什么？我们还将教你一些普遍接受的网络设计原则，如分层、封装和分组交换。

At the end of this unit, you should be able to answer questions like, what is the internet, what is an internet address, and how do applications such as the web Skype and BitTorrent work? These principles will help you design beta networks in the future. 
在本单元的最后，您应该能够回答一些问题，例如什么是互联网，什么是互联网地址，以及web Skype和BitTorrent等应用程序是如何工作的？这些原则将帮助您在未来设计beta网络。

At the end of this first unit, you should be familiar with something called the four layer model, the Internet. It describes how the internet is broken down into four distinct layers, You'll learn what those layers are, why they're a basic principle of good network design. 
在第一单元结束时，您应该熟悉称为四层模型的东西，即互联网。它描述了互联网如何被分解为四个不同的层，您将了解这些层是什么，为什么它们是良好网络设计的基本原则。

You learn what the internet's 4 layers are and how they work together. You'll learn that most applications use a transport layer called the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, and how some applications use it. You'll also learn that the Internet works by breaking up data into small units called packets, for example, when you request a web page, a computer sends some packets to the web server. The Internet decides how those packets of data arrive to the right destination. So this unit also examines one layer in particular in greater detail, it's the network layer you might have heard of IP the Internet Protocol, it's the protocol named after the internet because it's the glue that letsgo whole theme work You can change all of the other layers, but to be using the internet, you need to be using the Internet Protocol. At the network layer. You'll learn about what the Internet Protocol does and how it does it, you'll learn about the Internet protocol addresses and how they're assigned, you'll start to learn how the internet decides the path the packet should take based on its Internet address. Finally, we'll show you a few software tools that you can use to inspect how your computer is using the Internet so you can apply what you've learned in this unit the next time you browse the web. 
你将了解互联网的四层是什么以及它们如何协同工作。您将了解到大多数应用程序使用称为传输控制协议或TCP的传输层，以及一些应用程序如何使用它。您还将了解到，互联网的工作原理是将数据分解成称为数据包的小单元，例如，当您请求网页时，计算机会向web服务器发送一些数据包。互联网决定这些数据包如何到达正确的目的地。所以这个单元还更详细地检查了一层，它是你可能听说过的网络层，它是以互联网命名的协议，因为它是letsgo整个主题工作的胶水，你可以改变所有其他层，但是要使用互联网，你需要使用互联网协议。在网络层。你将了解互联网协议的作用以及如何实现它，你将了解互联网协议地址及其分配方式，你将开始了解互联网如何根据其互联网地址决定数据包应采取的路径。最后，我们将向您展示一些软件工具，您可以使用它们来检查您的计算机如何使用互联网，以便您可以在下次浏览网页时应用在本单元中学到的知识。
