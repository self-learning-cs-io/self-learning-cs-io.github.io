What ultimately makes networks interesting are the applications that use them. David Clark, one of the key contributors to the Internet's design, once wrote, the current exponential growth of the network seems to show that connectivity is its own reward, and it is more valuable than any individual application, such as mail or the World Wide Web. 
最终使网络有趣的是使用它们的应用程序。互联网设计的主要贡献者之一大卫克拉克曾经写道，当前网络呈指数级增长似乎表明连接性本身就是一种回报，它比任何单独的应用程序 (如邮件或万维网) 更有价值。

Connectivity is the idea that two computers in different parts of the world can connect to one another and exchange data. If you connect your computer to the Internet, you can suddenly talk with all of the other computers connected to the Internet. Let's look at exactly what that means and how some modern applications the world Wide Web, Skype and BitTorrent use it. The tremendous power of networked applications is that you can have multiple computers, each with their own private data, each perhaps owned and controlled by different people, exchange information unlike your local applications, which can only access data that resides on your local system, networked applications can exchange data across the world. 
连通性是指位于世界不同地区的两台计算机可以相互连接并交换数据。如果您将计算机连接到互联网，您可以突然与连接到互联网的所有其他计算机交谈。让我们来看看这究竟意味着什么，以及一些现代应用程序如万维网、Skype和BitTorrent如何使用它。网络应用程序的巨大力量在于，您可以拥有多台计算机，每台计算机都有自己的私有数据，每台计算机可能由不同的人拥有和控制，交换信息，不像您的本地应用程序只能访问驻留在本地系统上的数据，网络应用程序可以在全球范围内交换数据。

For example, think of using a web browser to read a magazine. The server is run by the publisher, which has all of the magazine articles. It might also have all the articles from past issues. As articles are corrected or added, you can immediately see the newer versions and newer content. Entire back catalog of articles might be too much for you to download, so you can load them on demand. If you didn't have a network, then you need someone to send you a DVD or a USB stick with the latest issue. So the basic model is that you have two computers, each running a program locally, and these two programs communicate over the network. 
例如，想象一下使用网络浏览器阅读杂志。服务器由出版商运行，出版商拥有所有杂志文章。它也可能包含过去问题的所有文章。随着文章的更正或添加，您可以立即看到更新的版本和更新的内容。整个文章的后台目录可能对您来说太多了，无法下载，因此您可以按需加载它们。如果你没有网络，那么你需要有人给你发送DVD或USB最新的问题。所以基本模型是你有两台计算机，每台计算机在本地运行一个程序，这两个程序通过网络进行通信。

The most common communication model used is a bidirectional reliable stream of bytes. So program A running on computer A can write data which goes over the network such that then program B running on computer B can read it. Similarly, program B can write data that program A can read. There are other modes of communication, which we'll talk about later in the course. But a reliable bidirectional byte stream is by far the most common one used in networks today. 
最常见的通信模型是双向可靠的字节流。因此，在计算机A上运行的程序A可以写入通过网络传输的数据，这样在计算机B上运行的程序B就可以读取它。同样地，程序B可以写入程序A可以读取的数据。还有其他的沟通方式，我们将在课程的后面讨论。但可靠的双向字节流是目前网络中最常用的一种。

Let's walk through what this looks like. Computer B on the right is waiting for other computers to connect to it. Computer A on the left wants to communicate with B, for example, though it's drawn here as a server, it could be a mobile phone running a web browser A and B set up a connection. Now, when A writes data to the connection, this data travels over the network and B can read it. Similarly, if B writes data to the connection, that data travels over the network and A can read it. 
让我们来看看它是什么样子的。右边的计算机B正在等待其他计算机连接到它。左边的计算机A想要与B通信，例如，尽管它在这里被绘制为服务器，但它可以是运行web浏览器的手机，a和B建立连接。现在，当A将数据写入连接时，该数据通过网络传输，B可以读取它。类似地，如果B将数据写入连接，则该数据通过网络传输，并且A可以读取它。

Either side can close the connection. For example, when the web browser is done requesting data from the web server, it can close the connection. Similarly, if the server wants to, it can close the connection as well. If you've ever seen an error message in a web browser saying connection reset by peer, that's what this means. The web server closed the connection when the web browser wasn't expecting it. Of course, the server can refuse the connection as well. You've probably seen connection refused messages, or have a browser wait for a long time because the server isn't even responding with the refusal. 
任何一方都可以关闭连接。例如，当web浏览器完成从web服务器请求数据时，它可以关闭连接。同样，如果服务器想要关闭连接，它也可以关闭连接。如果您曾经在web浏览器中看到一条错误消息，说明连接被对等方重置，这就是这意味着。当web浏览器不期望时，web服务器关闭了连接。当然，服务器也可以拒绝连接。你可能见过连接被拒绝的消息，或者因为服务器甚至没有响应拒绝而让浏览器等待很长时间。

Now that we've seen the basic way networked applications communicate, let's look at our first example, the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web uses something called Http, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. When you see Http colon slash slash in your browser, that means it's communicating using Http. We'll dig much deeper into the details of Http later in the course when we cover applications. 
现在我们已经看到了网络应用程序通信的基本方式，让我们看看我们的第一个例子，万维网。万维网使用一种叫做Http的东西，它代表超文本传输协议。当您在浏览器中看到Http冒号斜杠时，这意味着它正在使用Http进行通信。我们将在本课程稍后涵盖应用程序时更深入地探讨Http的细节。

发言人   03:41
For now I'm just going to give a very high level overview In Http, a client opens a connection to a server and sends commands to it. The most common command is Get, which requests a page. Http was designed to be a document centric way for programs to communicate. 
现在我只是要在Http中提供一个非常高级的概述，客户端打开与服务器的连接并向它发送命令。最常见的命令是Get，它请求一个页面。Http被设计成以文档为中心的程序通信方式。

发言人   04:00
If I type Http Www dot Stanford dot Edu in my browser, the browser opens a connection to the server Www dot Stanford dot Edu, it sends a get request for the root page of the site. The server receives the request, checks if it's valid, and the user can access that page and sends a response. The response has a numeric code associated with it. For example, if the server sends a 200 OK response to a get, this means that the request was accepted and the rest of the response has the document data. In the example of the Www dot Stanford, do EU webpage, a 200K response would include the hypertext that describes the main Stanford page. There are other kinds of requests such as put, delete, and info, as well as other responses such as 400, which means that there was a bad request, maybe was malformed. 
如果我在浏览器中键入Http Www点Stanford点Edu，浏览器会打开与服务器Www点Stanford点Edu的连接，它会发送一个对网站根页面的获取请求。服务器接收请求，检查请求是否有效，用户可以访问该页面并发送响应。响应有一个与之关联的数字代码。例如，如果服务器向一个get发送了一个200 OK的响应，这意味着该请求被接受，并且响应的其余部分具有文档数据。在Www.Stanford，do EU网页的例子中，一个200k的响应将包括描述斯坦福主页的超文本。还有其他类型的请求，如put、delete和info，以及其他响应，如400，这意味着有一个错误的请求，可能是畸形的。

发言人   04:51
Because Http is document centric clients client requests name a file. Http is all an Ascii text, it's human readable. For example, the beginning of a Get request for Stanford looks like this, the beginning of a response to a successful request looks like this. 
因为Http是以文档为中心的客户端请求命名文件。Http是一个Ascii文本，它是人类可读的。例如，对斯坦福大学的Get请求的开始看起来像这样，对成功请求的响应的开始看起来像这样。

发言人   05:12
The basic model is simple client, a client sends a request by writing to the connection, the server reads this request, process it, and writes a response to the connection, which the client then reads. 
基本模型是简单客户端，客户端通过向连接写入来发送请求，服务器读取此请求，处理它，并向连接写入响应，然后客户端读取响应。

Let's look at a second application. BitTorrent BitTorrent is a program that allows people to share and exchange large files. Unlike the web, where a client requests documents from a server, in BitTorrent, client request documents from other clients. So there's single client can request from many others in parallel. BitTorrent download files up into chunks of data called pieces. When a client downloads a complete piece from another client, it then tells other clients it has that piece. They can download it to. These collections of collaborating clients are called swarms. So we talk about a client joining or leaving the swarm. 
让我们看第二个应用。BitTorrent BitTorrent是一个允许人们共享和交换大文件的程序。与web不同，客户端从服务器请求文档，在BitTorrent中，客户端从其他客户端请求文档。因此，单个客户端可以并行地向许多其他客户端请求。BitTorrent将文件下载到称为碎片的数据块中。当一个客户端从另一个客户端下载完整的片段时，它会告诉其他客户端它拥有该片段。他们可以下载到。这些协作客户的集合被称为群。所以我们谈论客户加入或离开这个群体。

发言人   06:00
BitTorrent uses the exact same mechanism as the World Wide Web, a reliable bidirectional byte stream, but it uses it in a slightly more complex way. 
BitTorrent使用与万维网完全相同的机制，一种可靠的双向字节流，但它以稍微复杂的方式使用它。

发言人   06:08
When the client wants to download a file, it first has to find something called a torrent file. Usually you find this using the World Wide Web and download it using, you guessed it, Http. The torrent file describes some information about the data file you want to download. It also tells BitTorrent about who the tracker is for that torrent. 
当客户端想要下载一个文件时，它首先必须找到一个叫做torrent文件的东西。通常你使用万维网找到它并下载它，你猜对了，Http。torrent文件描述了有关要下载的数据文件的一些信息。它还告诉BitTorrent有关该洪流的跟踪器是谁。

发言人   06:28
A tracker is a node that keeps track, hence the name of what clients are members of the Swarm. To join a torrent, your client contacts the tracker again over h.t.t.p. to request the list of other clients. Your client opens connections to some of these other clients and starts requesting pieces of the file. These clients in turn, can request pieces on their own. Furthermore, when a new client joins this form, the tracker might tell this new client to connect to your client. So rather than a single connection between a client and a server, you have a dense graph of connections between clients dynamically exchanging data for a third and final application. 
跟踪器是一个跟踪的节点，因此客户端是群成员的名称。加入一个种子，你的客户通过h.t.p再次联系跟踪器。 请求其他客户端的列表。您的客户端会打开与其他一些客户端的连接，并开始请求文件的各个部分。反过来，这些客户可以自己请求零件。此外，当一个新客户端加入此表单时，跟踪器可能会告诉这个新客户端连接到您的客户端。因此，不是客户端和服务器之间的单个连接，而是在客户端之间动态地为第三个也是最终应用程序交换数据的密集连接图。

Let's look at Skype, the popular voice chat and video service. Skype's proprietary system doesn't have any official document documentation on how it works internally. In 2008, some researchers at Columbia figured out mostly how it works by looking at where and when Skype clients send messages. The messages were encrypted, though they couldn't look inside in 2011, however, if fame bushmanov reverse engineered the protocol and published open source code. So now we have a better sense of how the protocol works in its most simple mode. 
让我们看看Skype，流行的语音聊天和视频服务。Skype的专有系统没有任何官方文档说明其内部如何工作。2008年，哥伦比亚的一些研究人员主要通过观察客户在何时何地发送消息来Skype它的工作原理。这些消息是加密的，尽管它们在2011年无法查看内部，但是，如果成名bushmanov反向工程了协议并发布了开源代码。现在我们对协议如何在最简单的模式下工作有了更好的感知。

When you want to call someone in Skype, it's a simple client server exchange, sort of like Htt. Http. You, the caller, open a connection to the recipient. If the recipient accepts your call, you start exchanging voice, video, or chat data, but unlike the web, where there's a client in a server, in the Skype case, you have two clients. So rather than having a personal computer request something from a dedicated server, you have two personal computer requesting data from each other. This difference turns out to have a really big implication to how a Skype works. 
当你想给某个Skype打电话时，这是一个简单的客户端服务器交换，有点像Htt。Http。你，呼叫者，打开与接收者的连接。如果收件人接听了您的呼叫，您将开始交换语音、视频或聊天数据，但与服务器中有一个客户端的web不同，在Skype情况下，您有两个客户端。因此，与其让一台个人计算机从专用服务器请求某些内容，不如让两台个人计算机相互请求数据。这种差异对Skype的运作方式有很大的影响。

The complication comes from something called a Nat or network address translator. Nats are everywhere today. 
这种复杂性来自一种叫做Nat或网络地址转换器的东西。现在到处都有Nats。

A small home wireless router is a app. When a mobile phone connects the internet, it's behind the app. We'll cover them in greater detail later in the course, but for now, all you need to know is that if you're behind a Na, then you can open connections out to the internet, but other nodes on the internet can't easily open connections to you. 
一个小型家庭无线路由器是一个应用程序。当手机连接互联网时，它位于应用程序后面。我们将在课程的后面更详细地介绍它们，但现在，你需要知道的是，如果你在后面，那么你可以打开到互联网的连接，但互联网上的其他节点不能轻易打开到你的连接。

发言人   08:34
In this example, this means that client B can open connections to other nodes freely, but it's very hard for other nodes to open connections to client B, That's what this red green gradient is showing. Connections coming from the green side work find by connections coming from the red side don't. So the complication here is that if client A wants to call client B, it can't open a connection. It can't go through the app. 
在这个例子中，这意味着客户端B可以自由地打开与其他节点的连接，但是其他节点很难打开与客户端B的连接，这就是这个红绿渐变所显示的。来自绿色一侧的连接被来自红色一侧的连接所发现。所以这里的复杂性在于，如果客户端A想要调用客户端B，它无法打开连接。它不能穿过应用程序。

发言人   08:57
Skype has to work around this. It does so using something called a rendezvous server. When you log into Skype, your client opens connections to a network of control servers. In this case, client B opens a connection to the Rendezvous server. This works fine because the server isn't behind A At, and so client B can open connections without any problems. 
Skype必须解决这个问题。它使用称为会合服务器的东西来实现这一点。当您登录Skype时，客户端会打开与控制服务器网络的连接。在这种情况下，客户端B会打开与约会服务器的连接。这可以正常工作，因为服务器不在A后面，因此客户端B可以毫无问题地打开连接。

发言人   09:16
When a client A calls client B, it sends a message to the rendezvous server. Since the server has an open connection to client B, it tells me that there's a call request from a call dialog pops up on client B, if client B accepts the call, then it opens a connection to client A client A was trying to open a connection to client B, but since B was behind the I, it couldn't, so instead it sends a message to a computer that client B is already connected to, which then asks client B to open a connection back to client A, since client A isn't behind an app, this connection can open. 
当客户端a调用客户端B时，它会向约会服务器发送一条消息。由于服务器与客户端B有一个开放的连接，它告诉我在客户端B上弹出一个呼叫对话框的呼叫请求，如果客户端B接受了呼叫，则它会打开与客户端的连接，客户端a正在尝试打开与客户端B的连接，但是由于B在I后面，它不能，所以它向客户端B已经连接的计算机发送一条消息，然后要求客户端B打开一个连接回到客户端a，因为客户端a不在应用程序后面，所以这个连接可以打开。

发言人   09:49
Normally, this is called a reverse connection because it reverses the expected direction for initiating the connection. Client A is trying to connect to client B, but instead client B opens a connection to client A, this happens in Skype because Skype clients are typically personal machines, it's rare for publicly accessible web servers to be behind thats, since you want the server to be accessed by everyone on the internet, putting it behind an ad is a bad idea, therefore opening connections to web servers is easy. Personal computers, however, are often behind that for security and other reasons, therefore Skype has to incorporate some new communication patterns to work around them, so what does Skype do if both clients are behind that, we can't reverse the connection. Client A can't open a connection to client B, and client B can't open a connection to client A to handle this case Skype introduce a second kind of server called a relay. Relays can't be behind nuts if both client and client be are behind that, then they communicate through a relay, they both open connections to the relay. When client A sends data, the relay forwards it to client B through the connection that B opened. Similarly, when client B sends data, the relay forwards it to client A through the connection client A opened. 
通常，这被称为反向连接，因为它反转了启动连接的预期方向。客户端A正在尝试连接到客户端B，但客户端B打开了到客户端a的连接，这Skype发生，因为Skype客户端通常是个人机器，但公开可访问的web服务器很少在后面，因为您希望互联网上的每个人都可以访问服务器。把它放在广告后面是一个坏主意，因此打开与网络服务器的连接很容易。然而，个人计算机通常出于安全和其他原因落后于这一点，因此Skype必须采用一些新的通信模式来解决它们，因此如果两个客户端都落后于这一点，Skype会怎么做，我们无法扭转连接。客户端A无法打开与客户端B的连接，并且客户端B无法打开与客户端a的连接来处理这种情况，Skype引入称为中继的第二种服务器。如果客户端和客户端都在螺母后面，则中继不能在螺母后面，然后它们通过中继进行通信，它们都打开了与中继的连接。当客户端A发送数据时，中继通过B打开的连接将数据转发到客户端B。同样，当客户端B发送数据时，中继通过打开的连接客户端A将其转发到客户端A。

In summary, we've seen the most common communication model of networked applications, a reliable bidirectional byte stream. This allows two programs running on different computers to exchange data and abstracts away the entire network to a simple read write relationship. Although it's a very simple communication model, it can be used in very inventive and complex ways. 
总之，我们已经看到了网络应用程序最常见的通信模型，可靠的双向字节流。这允许在不同计算机上运行的两个程序交换数据，并将整个网络抽象为一个简单的读写关系。虽然这是一个非常简单的沟通模式，但它可以以非常有创意和复杂的方式使用。

We looked at three examples, the World Wide Web BitTorrent and Skype. The World Wide Web is a client server model. The client opens a connection to a server and request documents. The server responds with the documents. BitTorrent is a peer to peer model where swarms of clients open connections to each other and exchange pieces of data, creating a dense network of connections. Skype is a mix of the two. When Skype clients can communicate directly, they do so in a peer to peer fashion, but sometimes the clients aren't able to open connections directly and instead go through rendezvous relay servers. You can see how what looks like a very simple abstraction, a bidirectional reliable byte stream, can be used in many interesting ways by changing how programs open connections and what different programs do, we can create complex applications from document retrieval to swarming downloads to IP telephony trackers and BitTorrent, for example, have very different data and a very different role than the clients, just as Skype has relays in Rendezvous servers in addition to its clients. 
我们看了三个例子，万维网BitTorrent和Skype。万维网是一种客户端服务器模型。客户端打开与服务器的连接并请求文档。服务器用文档进行响应。BitTorrent是一种点对点模型，其中成群的客户端彼此打开连接并交换数据，从而创建密集的连接网络。Skype是两者的混合体。当Skype客户端可以直接通信时，它们以点对点的方式进行通信，但有时客户端无法直接打开连接，而是通过汇合中继服务器。你可以看到，看起来像一个非常简单的抽象概念，双向可靠的字节流，可以通过改变程序打开连接的方式和不同的程序的作用来以许多有趣的方式使用，我们可以创建从文档检索到蜂拥下载到IP电话跟踪器和BitTorrent的复杂应用程序，例如，它们与客户端具有非常不同的数据和非常不同的角色，就像Skype在其客户端之外还有在约会服务器中的中继一样。
