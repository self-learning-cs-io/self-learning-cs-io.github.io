When the internet was first designed, it was based on a controversial and revolutionary idea, packet switching. Nowadays, it seemed straightforward in the obvious way to build networks, but that wasn't always the case. It's a very simple idea, but of course, as it is with simple ideas, there are many interesting implications that arise once you put it into practice. We'll spend an entire week of the course on packet switching and its implications. But in this video, we present the high level idea and its immediate benefits. 
当互联网最初设计时，它基于一个有争议和革命性的想法，即分组交换。如今，建立网络似乎是显而易见的简单方法，但并非总是如此。这是一个非常简单的想法，但是当然，就像简单的想法一样，一旦你把它付诸实践，就会产生许多有趣的含义。我们将花费整整一周的时间来学习分组交换及其影响。但是在这个视频中，我们展示了高层次的想法及其直接的好处。

A packet is a self contained unit of data that carries information necessary for it to reach its destination. Packet switching is the idea that we break our data up into discrete self contained in chunks of data. Each chunk, called a packet, carries sufficient information that a network can deliver the packet all the way to its destination. So let's say we have a source and a destination and a network of packet switches, AB, and c between them. When A receives a packet for the destination, it sends it along the link to B, when B receives the packet for the destination, it sends along to C, and when C receives the packet for the destination, it sends it to the destination directly. 
数据包是一个独立的数据单元，它承载着到达目的地所需的信息。分组交换的想法是将我们的数据分解为独立包含在数据块中的离散数据。每个块 (称为数据包) 都携带足够的信息，网络可以将数据包一直传送到目的地。因此，假设我们有一个源和一个目的地，以及一个数据包交换机网络，AB和c在它们之间。当A收到发往目的地的数据包时，它会沿着链路面向企业发送，当B收到发往目的地的数据包时，它会沿着面向消费者发送，当C收到发往目的地的数据包时，它会直接将它发送到目的地。

In the simplest form of packet switching, each packet is routed separately and independently. For example, let's say there's another switch connected to B called D immediately after sending a packet to CB can send the next packet to D, or if the next packet were also to the destination, it would send two packets back to back to C? Here's a simple definition of packet switching means that independently, for each arriving packet, we pick its outgoing link. If the link is free, we send it, else we hold the packet for later. 
在最简单的分组交换形式中，每个分组都单独且独立地进行路由。例如，假设有另一个交换机连接，面向企业在发送数据包后立即调用D，面向消费者B可以将下一个数据包发送到D，或者，如果下一个数据包也发送到目标，它会发送两个数据包面向企业ack面向消费者？这是分组交换的简单定义，意味着对于每个到达的分组，我们独立地选择其传出链路。如果链接是免费的，我们就发送它，否则我们会保留数据包以供以后使用。

Here's one example of how packet switching can work, each packet contains an explicit route specifying the Id's of each packet switch along the way, all the way to the destination. We call this self routing or source routing because the source specifies the route. When the source sends a packet, it puts in the packet AB, it puts in the packet A and C, and then the destination, it forwards the packet to a, looks inside the header, and sees the next top is B, so it forwards the packet to BB send c is the next ho at c, and CCIs the last hop is the destination. Turns out the internet supports this source routing, but it's generally turned off because it raises big security issues. 
这是分组交换如何工作的一个例子，每个分组包含一个明确的路由，指定沿途每个分组交换机的Id，一直到目的地。我们称之为自路由或源路由，因为源指定了路由。当源发送数据包时，它放入数据包AB，放入数据包a和C，然后到达目的地，它将数据包转发到A，查看标头内部，并看到下一个顶部是B，所以它将数据包转发到BB，发送c是下一个ho在c，并且CCIs的最后一跳是目的地。事实证明，互联网支持这种源路由，但通常会关闭，因为这会引发严重的安全问题。

One simple optimization, and what the internet mostly does today is to place a small amount of state in each switch, which tells it which next hop to send packets to. For example, a switch can have a table of destination addresses and the next hop, when it receives a packet, it looks at the address in the table and sends the packet to the appropriate next top. In this model, all the packets packet needs to carry is the destination address using the address, each switch along the way can make the right decision. For example, in our network here A's table says the packets to destination should go to switch B, switch B's table says packets to destination should go to switch C, and so on. 
一个简单的优化，也是今天互联网主要做的是在每个交换机上放置少量状态，告诉它下一个发送数据包的跃点。例如，交换机可以有目的地址和下一跳的表格，当它收到数据包时，会查看表格中的地址，然后将数据包发送到相应的下一顶。在这个模型中，数据包需要携带的所有数据包都是使用地址的目的地址，沿途的每个交换机都可以做出正确的决策。例如，在我们的网络中，这里A的表表示发送到目的地的数据包应该去交换机B，switch B的表表示发送到目的地的数据包应该去交换机C，以此类推。

Packet switching has two really nice properties. The first is that a switch can make individual local decisions for each packet, it doesn't need to keep extra state on the packets it's seen, or two packets go to the same destination, even if many packets are part of some larger transfer or protocol, the switch doesn't need to know or care. The switch does need to know that some packets are a Skype call, others are a web request set. 
分组交换有两个非常好的特性。第一个是交换机可以为每个数据包做出单独的本地决策，它不需要在它看到的数据包上保留额外的状态，或者两个数据包去相同的目的地，即使许多数据包是一些更大的传输或协议的一部分。开关不需要知道或关心。交换机确实需要知道一些数据包是Skype呼叫，而其他数据包是web请求集。

Now still are a firmware update for your computer. It just forwards packets. This greatly simplifies the switch. The second is that it letsas switch efficiently share a link between many parties. For example, consider a wireless router in a home with two people browsing the internet on their laptops. If one person is reading a page, then the other person can download a file at the full speed of the link. If the first person starts loading a web page, the link can be shared between two of them. Once the download completes, the first person can use the full speed of the link. These two points are really important, so I'll go into some greater detail in both of them. 
现在仍然是您计算机的固件更新。它只是转发数据包。这大大简化了开关。第二个是它让开关有效地在多方之间共享链接。例如，假设家里有一个无线路由器，两人使用笔记本电脑浏览互联网。如果一个人正在阅读页面，那么另一个人可以以链接的全速下载文件。如果第一个人开始加载网页，则链接可以在他们中的两个人之间共享。一旦下载完成，第一个人就可以使用链接的全速。这两点非常重要，所以我将更详细地介绍它们。

Of course, when we communicate, we don't usually send only one packet, We send many. For example, a voice call consists of many consecutive packets, all part of the same communication. We call this sequence of packets a flow. More specifically, a flow is a collection of datagrams belonging to the same end to end communication, for example, a TCP connection. 
当然，当我们交流时，我们通常不只是发送一个数据包，而是发送许多个数据包。例如，一个语音呼叫由许多连续的数据包组成，它们都是同一通信的一部分。我们将这个数据包序列称为流。更具体地说，流是属于同一端到端通信的数据报集合，例如TCP连接。

Let's first of all look at how each packet is routed independently. Because each packet is self-sustained, a switch doesn't need to know about groups of packets or flows. Imagine if every switch had to keep track of every single web connection passing through it. This would require a huge amount of state that would be really hard to manage. Instead, treating each packet independently means the switch can be much simpler to build, manage, and troubleshoot. 
让我们首先看看每个数据包是如何独立路由的。因为每个数据包都是自我维持的，所以交换机不需要了解数据包或流的组。想象一下，如果每个交换机都必须跟踪通过它的每个web连接。这将需要大量的状态，很难管理。相反，独立处理每个数据包意味着交换机可以更容易地构建、管理和排除故障。

The switch doesn't need to worry about adding or removing the per-flow state. Imagine if every time you wanted to load a web page, you had to communicate with every switch along the path just to set up the state so that your request could get through. This could make things much, much slower. Instead, you can just send packets and the switches forward them appropriately. The switches also don't need to store this state because switches have to be really fast, they need to store this state in very fast memory, which would be expensive. This letsgo is focus on doing just one thing, forwarding packets quickly and efficiently. 
交换机不需要担心添加或删除每个流状态。想象一下，如果每次你想加载一个网页，你都必须与路径上的每个开关进行通信，以设置状态，以便你的请求能够通过。这可能会使事情变得非常、非常慢。相反，您可以发送数据包，然后交换机适当地转发它们。开关也不需要存储此状态，因为开关必须非常快，它们需要将此状态存储在非常快的内存中，这将是昂贵的。这个letsgo专注于做一件事，快速有效地转发数据包。

Finally, it means switches don't have to worry about failures. Imagine, for example, what happens when you start a web request, but then your tablet runs out of energy. The switch is going to keep the per-flow state for the request, but if one of the nodes that created the state fails, the switch needs to know how to clean up after it. Otherwise, you can have millions, billions, or however many of dead flows eating up your memory. With packet switching, a switch has no per end point state. If your tablet dies, the switch doesn't care, it just means that it stops receiving packets from it. In this way, the switch is more functionally independent of the computer sending traffic through it. 
最后，这意味着交换机不必担心故障。想象一下，例如，当您启动web请求，但随后平板电脑的能量耗尽时会发生什么。交换机将保持请求的每流状态，但如果创建状态的节点之一发生故障，交换机需要知道如何在其后进行清理。否则，你可能会有数百万、数十亿甚至更多的死流吞噬你的记忆。使用分组交换时，交换机没有每个端点的状态。如果你的平板电脑死掉了，开关并不在意，它只是意味着它停止接收来自它的数据包。这样，交换机在功能上更加独立于通过它发送流量的计算机。

Think about how you typically use the internet. Your use is bursty. You load a web page, then read it, then load another one. You download a few songs from iTunes, then listen to them, you stream a show from Netflix for 45 minutes, minutes, then stop. Data traffic is bursting rather than always sending and receiving data at a fixed rate, usage jumps and drops, goes up and down over time. While there are large scale changes in peaks in data traffic, 3 PM in the afternoon is typically high, as is 8 PM, while two in the morning is low. On a smaller scale, it is very bursty and these beasts bursts are often independent. 
想想你通常是如何使用互联网的。你的使用非常突发性。你加载一个网页，然后阅读它，然后加载另一个。你从iTunes下载几首歌曲，然后听它们，你从Netflix流式传输一个节目45分钟，然后停止。数据流量正在突增长，而不是总是以固定的速率发送和接收数据，使用量的跳跃和下降会随着时间的推移而上下变化。虽然数据流量的峰值会发生大规模变化，但下午3下午通常较高，如下午8点，而早上2点则较低。在较小的尺度上，它非常爆裂，这些野兽爆裂通常是独立的。

Let's say you and your friend are both browsing the web at a coffee shop when you load a new page. When your friend loads a new page are mostly independent. Sometimes you might overlap, but often they won't. By treating all of your traffic as just packets, the wireless router can very effectively and simply share its capacity between you. If you're loading a page when your friend is reading, the wireless router can give all of its capacity to your packets. Similarly, if your friend is loading a page and you're reading, the router can give all of its capacity in your friends packets. 
假设当您加载新页面时，您和您的朋友都在咖啡店浏览网页。当你的朋友加载一个新页面时，大部分页面都是独立的。有时你可能会重叠，但通常不会。通过将您的所有流量仅视为数据包，无线路由器可以非常有效地在您之间共享其容量。如果你正在加载一个页面，而你的朋友正在阅读，无线路由器可以为你的数据包提供所有的容量。同样，如果你的朋友正在加载一个页面而你正在阅读，路由器可以在你的朋友数据包中提供其所有容量。

The link doesn't need to go partially idle because one of you isn't using it. And if you're both using it, then the link can be shared between you. 
链接不需要部分空闲，因为你们中的一个没有使用它。如果你们都在使用它，那么这个链接可以在你们之间共享。

This idea of taking a single resource and sharing it across multiple users in a probabilistic or statistical way is called statistical multiplexing. It's statistical and that each user receives a statistical share of the resource based on how others are using it. For example, if your friend is reading, you can use all of the link. If both of you are loading a page, you receive half of the link capacity. So there are two major benefits of packet switching. First, it makes the switches simple because they don't need to know about flows of packets, and second, it letsrun to share the capacity among many flows sharing a link. This simple building block was revolutionary at the time, but it's now accepted as the common way to build networks. 
这种以概率或统计方式获取单一资源并在多个用户之间共享的想法被称为统计复用。它是统计性的，每个用户根据其他人如何使用它而获得资源的统计份额。例如，如果您的朋友正在阅读，您可以使用所有链接。如果你们俩都在加载一个页面，您将收到一半的链接容量。因此，分组交换有两个主要好处。首先，它使交换机变得简单，因为它们不需要了解数据包的流; 其次，它可以在共享链接的许多流之间共享容量。这种简单的积木在当时是革命性的，但现在已被接受为建立网络的常见方式。
