The Internet Protocol allows two computers to exchange messages across the network that's built up out of many different link layers. It does so through addresses. An IP packet has a source and a destination address. Routers decide which link to forward a packet based on the packet's destination address. Let's look in detail what IP version 4 addresses look like, how they are formatted, and how they are allocated. 
互联网协议允许两台计算机在由许多不同链路层组成的网络上交换消息。这是通过地址实现的。一个IP数据包有一个源和一个目的地址。路由器根据数据包的目标地址决定转发数据包的链路。让我们详细看看IP版本4地址的样子，它们是如何格式化的，以及它们是如何分配的。

The original goal of the Internet Protocol was to take many different networks and stitch them together. For this to work, the protocol needed a way to refer to a computer that was independent of the network it was on and was unique. So computer and an IBM network and a computer connected to a router over a serial line can talk to each other and need a way to address each other. Today Ipv 4 addresses are a bit more complicated. They're not totally unique to a bunch of special cases and uses, but for now, let's just assume that they're unique. 
互联网协议的最初目标是将许多不同的网络拼接在一起。为了使其工作，协议需要一种方法来引用独立于它所运行的网络并且是唯一的计算机。因此，计算机、IBM网络以及通过串行线路连接到路由器的计算机可以相互通信，并且需要一种方式来相互寻址。今天的Ipv 4地址有点复杂。它们并不完全是一堆特殊情况和用途所独有的，但现在，让我们假设它们是独一无二的。

An Internet Protocol version 4 address is 32 b long. These 32 b are often written as 4 octets, that is, 4 8 b values in the form a dot b dot c dot d. Here are three examples, 1 7 1 dot 6 4 dot 6 4 dot 6 4 1 2 8 dot 3 dot 7 6 dot 8 2, and 12.2 2.5 8.30. Every device connected through Ipv 4 has an Ipv 4 address. The IP layer delivers packets whose destination is this address to that device. 
一个互联网协议版本4地址的长度为32 b。这32个b通常被写成4个八位组，即4个8 b的值，形式为a点b点c点d。这里有三个例子，1 7 1点6 4 4 1 2 2 8点3点7 6点8 2，和12.2 2.5 8.30。每个通过Ipv 4连接的设备都有一个Ipv 4地址。IP层将目的地是此地址的数据包传送到该设备。

In addition to an address, a device typically also has something called a netmask. A netmask tells you which IP addresses are local on the same link on the same network, and which require going through an IP router. For example, think of a laptop on a wireless network. In order to send a packet to another device in the same wireless network, you don't need to go through an IP router. You can, in theory, just send the packet directly to the other device since it's in the same wireless network. 
除了地址之外，设备通常还具有称为网络掩码的东西。网络掩码告诉您哪些IP地址在同一网络的同一链路上本地，哪些需要通过IP路由器。例如，想象一台无线网络上的笔记本电脑。为了将数据包发送到同一无线网络中的另一个设备，您不需要通过IP路由器。理论上，您可以直接将数据包发送到其他设备，因为它们位于同一无线网络中。

A net mask is written as a string of consecutive ones, starting with the most significant bit. A net mask of 255 2 5 5 2 5 at 0, for example, means the first three octets are all ones. 2 to the 8th -1 is 255, and the last octet is 0. This means that an IP address which masses the first three octets, 24 b of your IP address, is on the same network. A netma of 255.255 point 252.0 means that netmask 22 b long, while 255 dot 1 2 8 dot 0 dot 0 is a 9 b netma. 
网络掩码被写成一串连续的掩码，从最高有效位开始。例如，网络掩码255 2 5在0处，意味着前三个八位字节都是一。第8个1的2是255，最后一个八位字节是0。这意味着一个覆盖前三个八位组的IP地址，即您的IP地址的24 b，位于同一网络中。255.255点的netma表示网络掩码22 b长，而255点1 2 8点0是9 b的netma。

You can tell whether two computers are in the same network by taking a bitwise and of their addresses within net-making. If the resulting addresses are equal, they are in the same network. Let's see what this looks like on my computer. I can open up a terminal and use the If Config program. My computer is connected to the internet over Wii Fi, which happens to be the link named En one if we look inside the information for En one, we can see that my Internet Protocol version 4 4 address is 1 9 2 dot 1 6 8 dot 0. Do 1 0 6 my netmask 0x ffrith fff 0, which is hexadecimal for 2 5 5.255 do 2 5 5 0. This means that if I send an IP packet to an address beginning with 1 9 2 do 1 6 8 do 0, I should send it directly. But if it doesn't begin with 1 9 2 dot 1 6 8 do 0, I need to send it through a router. 
你可以通过在网络中逐位获取它们的地址，来判断两台计算机是否在同一网络中。如果结果地址相等，则它们位于同一网络中。让我们看看它在我的电脑上看起来像什么。我可以打开一个终端并使用If配置程序。我的电脑通过Wii Fi连接到互联网，这恰好是一个名为En 1的链接，如果我们查看En 1的信息，我们可以看到我的互联网协议版本4的地址是1 9 2点1 6 8点0。执行1 0 6我的网络掩码0x ffith fff 0，这是2 5 5.255的十六进制值，执行2 5 5 0。这意味着如果我发送一个IP数据包到一个以1 9 2 do 1 6 8 do 0开头的地址，我应该直接发送它。但如果它不以1 9 2点1 6 8做0开头，我需要通过路由器发送它。
