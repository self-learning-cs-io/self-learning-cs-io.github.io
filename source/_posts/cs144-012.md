So our IP addresses assigned originally, they were broken up into three classes, class A, class B, and class C, each class separated an IP address into two parts, network and host. The network part of the address denoted an administrative domain such as MIT, BBC, or Stanford University. The host part of the address donated which device on that network. Class A addresses had a leading 0 7 b of network for 128 networks and 24 b of host. So a Class A could cover 16 million computers. Class B addresses had 16 b of hosts, it could cover 65536 computers. Class C addresses had 8 b of host, so could cover 256 computers. 
所以我们最初分配的IP地址被分成三个类，A类，B类和C类，每个类将IP地址分成两部分，网络和主机。地址的网络部分表示管理域，例如麻省理工学院、英国广播公司或斯坦福大学。地址的主机部分捐赠了该网络上的哪个设备。A类地址拥有128个网络和24个主机的前7个网络。一个A级课程可以覆盖1600万台计算机。B类地址有16个主机，可以覆盖65536台计算机。C类地址有8个主机，因此可以覆盖256台计算机。

While classes AB, and C are simple, we quickly found out they were not flexible enough. For example, both MIT and Stanford received one of the first Class A address blocks over 4 million addresses. For a while MIT would give each of its dorms the equivalent of a Class B, 65000 addresses for a few hundred people at most. When IP addresses were plentiful, this wasn't a problem, but as their use increased, we needed a better allocation policy. Useful note, Stanford gave up its Class A block in 1999. MIT still has it today. 
虽然类AB和C很简单，但我们很快发现它们不够灵活。例如，麻省理工学院和斯坦福大学都收到了超过四百万个地址的第一类地址块之一。有一段时间，麻省理工学院会给每个宿舍分配相当于B类的65000个地址，最多为数百人提供服务。当IP地址充足时，这不是问题，但随着IP地址使用的增加，我们需要更好的分配策略。有用的说明，斯坦福在1999年放弃了A级区块。麻省理工学院今天仍然有它。

Ipv 4 addresses are structured through something called Cider or Classless inter domain routing, rather than have prefixes only of length 8, 16, and 24 b. CR allows prefixes to be any number of bits. This means all cider prefixes define a block of addresses that is a power of two in size. 
Ipv 4地址通过称为Cider或无类域间路由的东西来构建，而不是只有长度为8、16和24 b的前缀。CR允许前缀为任意数量的位。这意味着所有的苹果酒前缀都定义了一个地址块，该地址块的大小是2的幂。

When we talk about cider addresses, we refer to as net masking. So for example, we talk about a slash 16, we mean a net mask of length 16. This cider block describes two of the 16th addresses, or 65536 addresses. When we talk about a slash 20, we made a net mask of length 20. This cider block describes 2 to the 12 addresses, or 4096 addresses. Cider blocks are how addresses are structured, addressed, and managed today. 
当我们谈论苹果酒地址时，我们称之为网络屏蔽。所以例如，我们谈论斜线16，我们指的是长度为16的网络掩码。此苹果酒块描述了第16个地址中的两个，即65536个地址。当我们谈论一个斜杠20时，我们制作了一个长度为20的网络掩码。此苹果酒块描述了2到12个地址，或4096个地址。苹果酒区块是当今地址的结构、寻址和管理方式。

Today, Stanford has five slash 16 blocks of about 325000 Ipv 4 addresses. 
今天，斯坦福大学有五个斜杠16个区块，共约325000个Ipv 4地址。

So how are Ipv 4 addresses allocated, managed? There's an organization called Iana, or for the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the ultimate authority. Ican, the Internet Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers. Ican delegates the work to Iana. Iana gives up slash eights describing 16 million addresses to regional internet registries called RRSP. Each continent has its own RR the RR for the United States is RN, where the RR for the Western Pacific is APNIC. These Rrs each have their own policy for how they break up the slash shades into smaller blocks of addresses and assign them to parties who need them. 
那么Ipv 4地址是如何分配和管理的呢？有一个叫做Iana的组织，或者说是互联网分配号码权威，终极权威。Ican，一个分配姓名和号码的互联网公司。Ican将工作委托给Iana。Iana放弃了向名为RRSP的区域互联网注册机构描述1600万个地址的斜杠。每个大陆都有自己的RR，美国的RR是RN，西太平洋的RR是apic。这些rs各自都有自己的政策，用于将斜杠拆分为更小的地址块，并将其分配给需要它们的各方。

You might have read in the news that we've run out of IP addresses. This isn't true. There are many unused addresses today. What did happen is that Ian, I ran out of slash eights to give out, reached a special end case in its charter when reduced to his last five slash 8 blocks Aana gave one slash 8 to each R now address management and allocation is up to the IRS. In 2012, John Peterson, who is then a member of the Internet Architecture Board, gave a target Stanford and some of the political, economic and technical complications that this raises. This talk isn't required material for the course, but I recommend it highly and you should be able to find that on the website. So now you've seen the structure of Ipv 4 addresses, how they're allocated, and how end-hosts their first top riding decisions, that is, whether to send to a local node or to their gateway. 
你可能已经在新闻中看到我们的IP地址用完了。这不是真的。现在有很多未使用的地址。发生的事情是，我用尽了八分之一的资金，在其章程中达到了一个特殊的最终情况，当减少到他的最后五个斜杠8个区块时，Aana给每个R一个斜杠8，现在地址管理和分配由IRS决定。2012年，时任互联网架构委员会成员的约翰佩特森 (John Peterson) 提出了斯坦福的目标以及由此引发的一些政治、经济和技术复杂性。这个演讲不是本课程的必修材料，但我强烈推荐，你应该能够在网站上找到它。现在你已经看到了Ipv 4地址的结构，它们是如何分配的，以及终端主机是如何做出首要决策的，即是发送到本地节点还是网关。

Router addresses are managed in terms of cider blocks, whose size is defined by the prefix length. A shorter prefix, say a slash 8, is a larger block than a longer prefix, say, at slash 10. 
路由器地址以苹果酒块进行管理，苹果酒块的大小由前缀长度定义。一个较短的前缀，比如说一个斜杠8，比一个较长的前缀更大的块，比如说在斜杠10处。
