In this video I'm going to continue the topic of the four layer internet model and I'm going to tell you about the ICMP service model. ICMP is the internet control message protocol and it's used to report errors and diagnose problems with the network layer. You'll recall that IP doesn't provide any guarantees about delivery, but it does help, and it will prove to be a very valuable tool to get some hints and some information back from the network layer to tell us about when things are going wrong. 
在本视频中，我将继续讨论四层互联网模型的主题，并向您介绍ICMP服务模型。ICMP是互联网控制消息协议，用于报告错误和诊断网络层问题。你会记得，IP不提供任何关于交付的保证，但它确实有帮助，它将被证明是一个非常有价值的工具，可以从网络层获取一些提示和信息，告诉我们什么时候出了问题。

There are three mechanisms that we use to make the network layer work in the Internet. The first we've already seen is the Internet Protocol, or IP. This creates IP datagrams and then delivers them hop by hop from end to end. The second of the routing tables sitting inside the routers. There are algorithms that run to populate these router forwarding tables so that the routers know how to deliver them hop by hop to the other end. 
我们使用三种机制来使网络层在互联网中工作。我们已经看到的第一个是互联网协议，或IP。这将创建IP数据报，然后从端到端逐跳传递它们。位于路由器内的第二个路由表。有一些算法运行以填充这些路由器转发表，以便路由器知道如何将它们逐跳地传送到另一端。

The third mechanism, which is the purpose of this video, is ICMP or the Internet Control Message Protocol. ICMP helps communicate information about the network layer between the end hosts and the routers. And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of those in a minute. It's typically used to report error conditions and helps us diagnose problems, figure out the path taken by packets, and so on, okay? 
第三种机制，也就是本视频的目的，是ICMP或互联网控制消息协议。ICMP帮助在终端主机和路由器之间传达网络层的信息。我马上要给你们看几个例子。它通常用于报告错误条件并帮助我们诊断问题，找出数据包的路径等等，好吗？

ICMP runs above the network layer and so strictly speaking, it's a transport layer protocol. When an end host or router wants to report an error using ICMP, it puts the information that it wants to send back to the source into an ICMP payload and hands it to IP to be sent as a datagram. 
ICMP运行在网络层之上，因此严格来说，它是一种传输层协议。当终端主机或路由器想要使用ICMP报告错误时，它会将想要发送回来源的信息放入ICMP负载中，并将其传递给IP以作为数据报发送。

Let's look at an example. As I said ICMP typically gets used as a method for error reporting. And in fact you've seen it if you've ever seen the message destination network unreachable. 
让我们来看一个例子。正如我所说，ICMP通常被用作错误报告的方法。事实上，如果你曾经见过消息目标网络无法访问，你就已经看到了。

Let's look at example. Imagine that I have a web client running as the application here. So I've got an Http or web client here that's going to be accessing an Http server over here at B, so as we've seen before, the application bytes before Http get put into the transport layer, as usual, into TCP, comes down to the network layer, goes out along the link, comes up to the router along here. 
让我们看一个例子。想象一下，我有一个web客户端在这里作为应用程序运行。所以我在这里有一个Http或web客户端，它将在B处访问Http服务器，所以正如我们之前看到的，在Http被放入传输层之前的应用程序字节，像往常一样，进入TCP，归结到网络层，沿着链接出去，沿着这里走到路由器。

Imagine that the address that is put in here, it's actually to a network that this router has no information about in its forwarding table. Now, this would be a pretty bad situation because that router doesn't know how to forward the packet to be. But if that happens, then the router will send back a message. And so this will come back down through the network to A and it will say in it destination network. Unreachable. And that's simply saying that it has no means to deliver that packet to B, so it's alerting A by sending that back. And we'll see the format that it uses in a moment. 
想象一下这里放的地址，它实际上是路由器转发表中没有任何信息的网络。现在，这将是一个相当糟糕的情况，因为该路由器不知道如何转发数据包。但如果发生这种情况，路由器将发送一条消息。因此，这将通过网络返回到目标网络。无法到达。这只是说它无法面向企业传送该数据包，因此它通过发送该数据包来提醒A。我们一会儿就会看到它使用的格式。

So basically, the ICMP service model is very, very simple. It allows it to send a reporting message, a selfish, contained message, recording the error. It's unreliable in the sense that it sends a simple datagram. It doesn't attempt to resend it. It doesn't maintain any state of the messages that it sent, it simply sends back a digest if giving an indication of what the problem was, And in fact, how it actually works is when a message comes in. 
基本上，ICMP服务模型非常非常简单。它允许它发送一条报告消息，一条自私的包含消息，记录错误。它在发送简单数据报的感知中是不可靠的。它不会试图重新发送。它不维护它发送的消息的任何状态，它只是在给出问题的指示时发回摘要，实际上，它是如何工作的，当消息进来时。

So for example, an IP datagram. So here is my IP datagram. Here is the header, here is the payload, or the data portion of my IP datagram. So this is my IP datagram. 
例如，一个IP数据报。这是我的IP数据报。这是标头，这是负载，或我的IP数据报的数据部分。所以这是我的IP数据报。

发言人   03:44
Let's say that this has just arrived, and in my previous example, this has arrived from a to the first router. If the first router wants to send back an ICMP message, what it does is it takes a, it takes the header. Now this header here has source address A and destination address B, and it will populate this into, it'll place this into an ICMP message. So we'll take this header and put it into the ICMP message. So this is my ICMP message. And it will also take the first 8 B of the AP payload. And it'll put this into the ICMP message. And then it marks it with a type and a code. 
假设这刚刚到达，在我之前的示例中，这已经从第一个路由器到达。如果第一个路由器想要发回一个ICMP消息，它所做的就是接收一个，它接收报头。现在这里的标头有源地址A和目标地址B，它会将其填充进去，并将其放入ICMP消息中。所以我们将使用此标头并将其放入ICMP消息中。这是我的ICMP信息。它还将占用AP有效负载的前8 B。它会将此内容放入ICMP消息中。然后它用类型和代码标记它。

And we'll see some examples of these types and codes in a moment. And then the whole lot gets placed into a new IP datagram. So this is the data of the new IP datagram. And this is going to be sent back. 
我们稍后会看到这些类型和代码的一些示例。然后所有的数据报都被放入一个新的IP数据报中。所以这是新的IP数据报的数据。这个将被送回。

发言人   04:45
So this is the header. And so the IP source will be the router. So I'll just put R for router, and the IP destination in my example will be a, it's going to send it back to A to tell it that this was the error, this was the type of error. This is how it figures out what type of error it was. This was the data associated with that error. It's the IP datagram that was originally causing the problem that's all placed into the data of the IP datagram that goes back again to a, there's a good example of some particular ICMP message types. 
所以这是标题。因此，IP来源将是路由器。所以我只把R作为路由器，在我的例子中，IP目标将是a，它将把它发回给A，告诉它这是错误，这是错误的类型。这就是它如何计算出它是什么类型的错误。这是与该错误相关的数据。最初导致问题的是IP数据报，而这个问题又全部被放置在IP数据报的数据中，然后又回到IP数据报，有一个很好的例子，展示了一些特定的ICMP消息类型。

There are a lot of message types. This is just a sampling of them. These are the six most important that we see. And you don't need to remember the types of the codes. You'll find those in the Internet, RFC 792, and you can just look that up online if you want. These are the ones that are most commonly used. And I'll just go through examples. We've already seen the network unreachable. This was type 3 code 0, and there are two other destination unreachable ones, host unreachable, that's. 
有很多消息类型。这只是他们的一个样本。这些是我们看到的六个最重要的。你不需要记住代码的类型。你可以在互联网上找到这些，RFC 792，如果你愿意，你可以在网上查找。这些是最常用的。我只会举出一些例子。我们已经看到网络无法访问。这是类型3代码0，并且还有两个其他目标无法到达，主机无法到达。
