In this unit, you learn about the layer. Specifically, you learned about the three most important transport layers in use today. The first TCP, or the Transmission Control Pro, is used by over 95% of internet applications. TCP is almost universally used because it provides the reliable end to end bidirectional byte stream service that almost all applications desire. Most of the videos in this unit were about TCP. You learned how we detect that a packet was not delivered or was corrupted along the way, and you learned about the mechanisms TCP uses to successfully retransmit data until it's correctly delivered. We spent three videos exploring different methods for reliably delivering data across the unreliable internet. 
在本单元中，您将学习图层。具体来说，您了解了目前使用的三个最重要的传输层。第一个TCP或传输控制Pro被超过95% 的互联网应用程序使用。TCP几乎被普遍使用，因为它提供了可靠的端到端双向字节流服务，几乎所有应用程序都需要。本单元中的大多数视频都是关于TCP的。你学习了我们如何检测数据包未送达或在此过程中已损坏，并且了解了TCP用于成功重新传输数据直到正确送达的机制。我们花了三个视频探索在不可靠的互联网上可靠地传递数据的不同方法。

The second transport layer we studied is UDP, or the User Datagram Protocol, UDP is used by applications that don't need the guaranteed delivery service of TCP either because the application handles retransmissions in its own private way or because the application just doesn't need the reliable delivery. All UDP does is take application data and create a UDP datagram. The UDP datagram identifies the application that the data should be sent to at the other end. That's about it, although very few applications use UDP. We saw examples of DNS and DHCP, which are both simple request response query protocols. 
我们研究的第二个传输层是UDP，或者用户数据报协议，UDP被不需要TCP的保证传输服务的应用程序使用，要么是因为应用程序以自己的私有方式处理重传，要么是因为应用程序不需要可靠的传输。所有UDP所做的就是获取应用程序数据并创建UDP数据报。UDP数据报标识数据应该发送到另一端的应用程序。仅此而已，尽管很少有应用程序使用UDP。我们看到了DNS和DHCP的例子，它们都是简单的请求响应查询协议。

The third transport layer we started is ICMP, or the Internet Control Message Protocol icmp's Main job is to send feedback if things are going wrong, for example, if a router receives an IP datagram but doesn't know where to send it next, then it sends an I icmpd back to the source to let it know. ICMP is very useful for understanding why end to end communications are not working properly. 
我们开始的第三个传输层是ICMP，或者互联网控制消息协议icmp的主要工作是在出现问题时发送反馈，例如，如果路由器收到IP数据报但不知道下一步将其发送到哪里，然后它发送一个I icmpd回源代码让它知道。ICMP对于理解为什么端到端通信无法正常工作非常有用。

Finally, you learned about one of the most important overarching architectural principles that guided the design of the internet and continues to guide our thinking today. It's called the end to end principle. We learned about two versions of the end to end principle. The milder version says that there are some functions that can only be correctly implemented at the edges or fringe of the network. These clearly need to be implemented there end to end. Reliable file transfer and security are two examples that we saw. It's okay to help these features by adding functions to the network, but these can only help not replace the end to end functionality. 
最后，您了解了指导互联网设计的最重要的总体架构原则之一，并继续指导我们今天的思维。这被称为端到端原则。我们了解了端到端原则的两个版本。较温和的版本表示，有些功能只能在网络的边缘或边缘正确实现。这些显然需要端到端地实施。可靠的文件传输和安全性是我们看到的两个例子。通过向网络添加功能来帮助这些功能是可以的，但这些只能帮助而不是取代端到端的功能。

The second, stronger version of the end to end principle says that if we can implement a function at the end hosts, then we should. The basic idea is that network should be kept simple, streamlined with as few features to go wrong to slow things down or require upgrading. It assumes that the end hosts are quite intelligent, such as a laptop or a smartphone, and can implement many of the features needed by the application. 
第二个，更强大的端到端原则版本说，如果我们可以在终端主机上实现一个函数，那么我们应该。基本思想是网络应该保持简单，精简，尽可能少的功能出现问题以减慢速度或需要升级。它假设终端主机非常智能，例如笔记本电脑或智能手机，并且可以实现应用程序所需的许多功能。

In this unit, you studied five main topics. 1 3 widely used transport layers TCB for reliable delivery of a byte stream between applications. UDP as an unreliable delivery of datagrams between applications and ICMP, is a way to detect when things go wrong to how TCP works, with a particular emphasis on how it reliably delivers bytes between 2 applications. You learned how data errors and missing packets are detected and how packets are retransmitted, as well as several different retransmission strategies, including selective repeat and go back in. You learn about how the basic TCP mechanism uses go back end and keeps track of the outstanding unacknowledged bytes using a sliding window. You also learn about the TCP state machine that keeps track of the current status of the TCP connection 3. 
在本单元中，您学习了五个主要主题。广泛使用的传输层TCB，用于在应用程序之间可靠地传输字节流。UDP作为应用程序和ICMP之间数据报的不可靠传递，是一种检测TCP工作方式出现问题的方法，特别强调它如何在两个应用程序之间可靠地传递字节。你学习了如何检测数据错误和丢失数据包，如何重传数据包，以及几种不同的重传策略，包括选择性重复和返回。您将了解基本的TCP机制如何使用后台并使用滑动窗口跟踪未确认的字节。您还将了解跟踪TCP连接当前状态的TCP状态机3。

You learned how UDP works and why it's used by a small number of applications, or you learned how ICMP works and how it helps us detect when communications go wrong. To monitor the performance of a route between 2 end hosts. Finally, you learned about the end to end principle, which is an important overarching principle used in the design of the internet and many other communication systems throughout this and after you go out into the world to use your networking expertise, you'll find many people talking about this principle to help guide their design decisions. 
你了解了UDP的工作原理以及为什么它被少数应用程序使用，或者你了解了ICMP的工作原理以及它如何帮助我们检测通信出错的情况。监视2台终端主机之间的路由性能。最后，您了解了端到端原则，这是在互联网和许多其他通信系统设计中使用的重要总体原则，在您走出去使用您的网络专业知识之后，你会发现很多人谈论这个原则来帮助指导他们的设计决策。

So you should now have a good understanding of three transport layers. You should understand different retransmission strategies and why TCP uses a sliding window. You should know why TCP uses connections, how they are established, and the finite state machine that maintains them. And finally, you should be able to explain the end to end principle. 
所以你现在应该对三个传输层有了很好的理解。你应该了解不同的重传策略以及为什么TCP使用滑动窗口。你应该知道为什么TCP使用连接，它们是如何建立的，以及维护它们的有限状态机。最后，你应该能够解释端到端的原则。
