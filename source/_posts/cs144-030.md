You will have heard many times that the internet has transformed society in ways not seen since the invention of the printing press. In this video I'm going to give you a brief background on the history of networking leading up to the invention of the Internet in the 1960s. Let's start with a brief history of how messages were communicated over long distances. Well, today, we think nothing of sending an email to the other side of the world. 
你可能已经多次听到互联网以自印刷机发明以来从未见过的方式改变了社会。在这个视频中，我将为您简要介绍导致互联网在1960年代发明的网络历史背景。让我们先简要介绍一下长距离消息传递的历史。今天，我们认为向世界的另一边发送电子邮件没有什么意义。

3000 years ago, it was very hard to communicate over long distances at all. 
3000年前，很难进行长距离通信。

The first recorded long distance communications are from about 1000 BC and were mostly put in place for military offensive defensive purposes. Fire beacons were used to signal the arrival of an enemy or to synchronize an attack. This is an example of a fire beacon in the south of England. Fire beacons carry information fast. They work particularly well at night when danger is greatest, but they carry very little information. Generally, they are on or off signaling danger. 
第一次有记录的长途通信大约发生在公元前1000年左右，主要用于军事进攻性防御目的。消防信标被用来发出敌人到达的信号或同步攻击。这是英格兰南部的一个火灾信标的例子。消防信标携带信息迅速。它们在晚上最危险的时候工作得特别好，但它们携带的信息很少。通常，它们会发出危险信号。

Carrier pigeons, human messengers, and horse relays have been used around the world for thousands of years because they can carry more information. But the information travels more slowly than a fire beacon, and messengers are prone to interception. Along the way. Message could be read, tampered with, or blocked completely. 
信鸽、人类信使和马继电器已经在世界各地使用了数千年，因为它们可以携带更多的信息。但是信息传播的速度比火标要慢，信使容易被拦截。一路上。消息可能被读取、篡改或完全阻止。

The earliest recorded relay systems were horses in Egypt and China 2 or 3000 years ago. They were common throughout history. In the 13th century, Marco Polo described how the great Mongol ruler Kublai Khan used horse relays. His army had relay stations every 40 km, with 400 horses waiting for relay riders. Horse relays were used all the way up to the 19th century for mail delivery in the famous Ponyo Express across the USA. These early systems were limited in the information they could carry or by the speed of delivery, such as horses, humans, and pigeons. 
最早有记录的中继系统是2或3000年前埃及和中国的马。它们在历史上是普遍的。在13世纪，马可波罗描述了伟大的蒙古统治者忽必烈汗如何使用马继电器。他的军队每40公里都有中转站，有400匹马等待接力者。直到19世纪，马的继电器一直被用于横跨美国著名的庞约快递的邮件传递。这些早期的系统在所能携带的信息或传递速度方面受到限制，例如马、人类和鸽子。

Around 2000 years ago, optical methods started to be used, such as flags and heliographs, which encoded digital information such as letters, words, and numbers. These systems transmit data at the speed of light over limited distances. With limited information. They're basically simple encodings, but perhaps the biggest advances in optical communications happened in France around the time of the French Revolution in 1793, when Claude Shap invented and started building a semaphore telegraph network. Claude Shop built towers with a large horizontal beam called the regulator, with two smaller arms called indicators. It looked like a human being giving different signals with their arms. The location of the arms indicated a symbol. 
大约在2000年前，光学方法开始被使用，例如旗帜和日光图，它们对数字信息进行编码，例如字母、单词和数字。这些系统在有限的距离内以光速传输数据。信息有限。它们基本上是简单的编码，但也许光通信的最大进步发生在1793年法国革命时期的法国，当时克劳德·沙普发明了并开始建设一个信号量电报网络。克劳德商店建造了带有大型水平梁的塔楼，称为调节器，带有两个较小的臂，称为指示器。它看起来像一个人用手臂发出不同的信号。手臂的位置表示一个符号。

In 1793, the French government built 15 stations to cover 190 km, or about 13 to 15 km per station. By 1804, a 370 kilome network stretched from Paris to Dijon. The system was used to send a variety of messages, including military information and fast-breaking news. Most went towards Paris to report information from the provinces. The operators became quite skilled. The fastest messages could be signaled by one station every 1020 seconds and could cross France in less than 30 minutes. They could send about 3000 signs per day, corresponding to a few hundred messages to make the network function properly. 
1793年，法国政府建造了15个站点，覆盖190公里，或每个站点约13至15公里。到1804年，一个从巴黎延伸到第戎的370公里网络。该系统被用来发送各种信息，包括军事信息和突发新闻。大多数人前往巴黎报告各省的信息。操作员变得非常熟练。最快的消息可以每1020秒由一个站点发出信号，并可以在不到30分钟的时间内穿越法国。他们每天可以发送大约3000个标志，相当于几百条消息，以使网络正常运行。

The optical telegraph systems in France and Sweden developed a number of concepts that are used in networks to this day. They needed to develop five concepts in particular. 
法国和瑞典的光学电报系统发展了许多概念，至今仍在网络中使用。他们需要特别发展五个概念。

发言人   03:37
The first were codes. These are symbols to indicate characters and control signals like start of transmission, end of transmission, weight, or conflict. When two signals arrived at the same time, error to cancel the last code, priority between conflicting messages, failure of a tower, an acknowledgement, and even rain or fog to say we couldn't even see the signal that you sent. 
第一个是代码。这些符号表示字符和控制信号，如传输开始、传输结束、重量或冲突。当两个信号同时到达时，取消最后一个代码的错误，冲突消息之间的优先级，塔故障，确认，甚至下雨或雾说我们甚至看不到您发送的信号。

发言人   04:02
The second with flow control, this stops the sender from overwhelming the receiver. Basically, the receiver tells the sender to slow down because it can't keep up. Third was synchronization to tell when one symbol ended and the next one started. This helped delineate words made up of several symbols. The fourth concept was error correction and retransmission to tell the sender when symbols were misunderstood. This allows the sender to try sending the symbols again. 
第二个是流量控制，这可以防止发送方压倒接收方。基本上，接收者告诉发送者放慢速度，因为它跟不上。第三个是同步，以告诉一个符号何时结束以及下一个符号何时开始。这有助于描绘由几个符号组成的单词。第四个概念是错误纠正和重传，以便在符号被误解时告诉发送者。这允许发件人尝试再次发送符号。

发言人   04:29
Finally, they even used encryption so that messages could not be intercepted. They were particularly worried about news of the stock market beating the newspapers. By 1830, the Shap optical telegraph network was very extensive, covering most of France. 
最后，他们甚至使用了加密技术，使消息无法被拦截。他们特别担心股市战胜报纸的消息。到1830年，Shap光学电报网络非常广泛，覆盖了法国大部分地区。

We can characterize four main steps of invention in communication networks up until about the 17 hundreds. First, from about 2000 B, humans used systems to signal a small set of predefined, for example, using fire beacons. Second, starting in the 16 hundreds, people developed systems to transmit arbitrary messages by encoding the entire alphabet. By the early 17 hundreds, numeric codes started to be used for common words and phrases. This was the earliest form of compression because it required less information to be sent over the link. 
我们可以描述通信网络发明的四个主要步骤，直到大约17个世纪。首先，从大约2000 B开始，人类使用系统向一小部分预定义的信号发送信号，例如使用火标。其次，从16世纪开始，人们开发了通过编码整个字母表来传输任意信息的系统。到17世纪初，数字代码开始用于常见的单词和短语。这是最早的压缩形式，因为它需要通过链路发送较少的信息。

During the 17 hundreds, codes were developed for control signals they could communicate, when to start and stop sending, when to slow down, how to retransmit, and so on. This was the birth of what we call today protocols. He agreed upon rules governing how two or more parties communicate. By 1800, there were a number of different optical telegraph systems developed across and developed and deployed across Europe using a variety of different protocol signals such as these initialization to indicate we're about to start communicating error control arrays, resend, stop, wait, selective repeat. These are used to retransmit data that is corrupted along the way, as you already seen in videos about different retransmission strategies and flow control, faster, slower to tell the sender, we can or can't keep up clearly, there was an enormous step forward in communications when the telephone was invented at the end of the 19th century for some time, there had been many attempts to increase the capacity of the electrical telegraph network that now connected many towns across the United States. Alexander Graham Bell, shown here, a Scottish born inventor, transmitted the first voice call in 1870 in the very celebrated phone call to his colleague Thomas Watson, while his patent was challenged many times, most notably by fellow inventor Alicia Gray, the patent stood up to legal challenges, and we generally attribute the invention the Bell. Within 10 years, over 150000 people owned telephones and by 1915 the first transcontinental phone call was made from New York to San Francisco. 
在17世纪期间，编码被开发出来用于控制信号的通信，何时开始和停止发送，何时减速，如何重传等等。这就是我们今天所称的协议的诞生。他就管理两方或多方通信的规则达成一致。到1800年，有许多不同的光学电报系统在欧洲开发和部署，使用各种不同的协议信号，例如这些初始化以指示我们即将开始通信错误控制阵列，重新发送，停止，等待，选择重复。这些用于重新传输一路上损坏的数据，正如你已经在有关不同重新传输策略和流量控制的视频中看到的那样，更快，更慢地告诉发件人，我们可以或不能清楚地跟上，当19世纪末发明电话时，通信向前迈出了一大步，在一段时间内，人们多次尝试增加现在连接美国许多城镇的电报网络的容量。这里展示的亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔是一位苏格兰出生的发明家，在1870年给他的同事托马斯·沃特森的一次非常著名的电话中发出了第一个声音，而他的专利受到了多次挑战，最引人注目的是被发明家艾丽西亚·格雷所挑战，该专利经受住了法律挑战。我们通常将这项发明归因于铃铛。在10年内，超过15万人拥有电话，到1915年，第一个跨洲电话从纽约打到了旧金山。

The series of events and inventions that eventually led to the Internet started in earnest in about 1960. In 1962, JCR licklider at MIT started to write memos and give talks about his concepts, an intergalactic network in which everyone on the globe is interconnected and can access programs and data at any site from anywhere. He talked of being able to communicate with his own intergalactic network of researchers across the country. This is widely thought to be the first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled by a large communication network very much like the Internet of today lulier became the first head of the computer research program at DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, from 1962. While at DARPA, he convinced Ivan Sutherland Bob Taylor and MIT researcher Larry Roberts of the importance of his new networking concept, and they took up the mantle when they succeeded him at DARPA in 1964, researcher Paul Barron wrote what is now considered the first academic paper about large scale communication networks, the paper isn't on data communication networks. At about the same time, Leonard Klein rock's thesis was published on queueing theory, Donald Davis was working on very similar ideas at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK in 1965, working with Thomas Merrill, Larry Roberts connected the TX two computer in Massachusetts to the Q 32 in California with a low speed dial up telephone line, creating the first wide area computer network ever built. Larry Roberts joined DARPA in 1966 to help develop the first Arpa Net Plans, which were published in 1967 in 1969, the first four nodes were installed at UCLA Sri UCSB and University of Utah and the very first messages sent over the Arpanet. 
最终导致互联网诞生的一系列事件和发明大约在1960年正式开始。1962年，麻省理工学院的JCR licklider开始撰写备忘录并发表有关他的概念的演讲，这是一个星际网络，地球上的每个人都相互连接，可以从任何地方访问任何站点的程序和数据。他谈到能够与全国各地的研究人员星际网络进行沟通。这被广泛认为是第一个记录的描述社交互动的记录，这种社交互动可以通过一个非常像今天的互联网的大型通信网络实现，lulier从1962年开始成为国防高级研究计划局 (DARPA) 计算机研究计划的第一任负责人。在DARPA时，他说服了Ivan Sutherland Bob Taylor和麻省理工学院研究员Larry Roberts承认他的新网络概念的重要性，并于1964年在DARPA接替他时开始了这项工作。研究员保罗·巴伦撰写了现在被认为是第一篇关于大规模通信网络的学术论文。这篇论文不是关于数据通信网络的。大约在同一时间，莱昂纳德·莱因·洛克的论文发表了关于排队论的文章，唐纳德·戴维斯于1965年在英国国家物理实验室与托马斯·梅里尔一起研究非常相似的想法，拉里罗伯茨通过一根低速拨号电话线将马萨诸塞州的TX两台电脑连接到加利福尼亚州的q32，创建了有史以来第一个广域计算机网络。拉里·罗伯茨 (Larry Roberts) 于1966年加入DARPA，帮助开发第一个Arpa网络计划，该计划于1967年和1969年发布，前四个节点安装在UCLA Sri UCSB和犹他州大学，并且第一个通过Arpanet发送的信息。

This is what the internet looked like in 1969. It was called the Arpanet and was a single closed proprietary network. 
这就是1969年互联网的样子。它被称为阿帕网，是一个封闭的专有网络。

By the early 1970s, a number of different packet switch data networks started to appear. In 1971, the first packet radio network was built between the Hawaiian island and it was called Aloha Net. The mechanisms developed for the Aloha protocol have influenced pretty much every wireless network ever since. Also in 1971, the Siglos Research Network was built in France. It was the first to give the end host the responsibility for reliable communications and heavily influenced the design of the Internet. In 1974, IBM introduced an entire data network stack called SNA, which stands for Systems Network Architecture. Its goal was to reduce the cost of building large time-shared computers with many teletype terminals rather than batch processing with punch cards. 
到了1970年代早期，开始出现了许多不同的分组交换数据网络。在1971年，第一个分组无线电网络在夏威夷群岛之间建立，它被称为Aloha网。从那时起，为Aloha协议开发的机制几乎影响了所有无线网络。同样在1971年，Siglos研究网络在法国建立。它是第一个让终端主机负责可靠通信的公司，并对互联网的设计产生了重大影响。在1974年，IBM引入了一个名为SNA的完整数据网络堆栈，它代表系统网络架构。它的目标是降低使用许多电传打字终端构建大型分时计算机的成本，而不是使用打孔卡进行批处理。

DARPA sponsored work on internetting to create the first network of networks to connect together networks around the world. The protocols needed for internetting were first described by Vince Surf from Stanford and Bob Khan from DARPA in a now famous paper in 1974 with a title A protocol for packet network in communication. TCP called for reliable in sequence delivery of data and included much of what we call today the network layer as well. In the early days, there was no notion of congestion control. It was added to the internet about 15 years later. By the end of the 1970s TCP and IP were separated, making room for UDP to be added as an unreliable transport service as well. 
DARPA赞助了互联网工作，以创建第一个将世界各地的网络连接在一起的网络。互联网所需的协议最初是由斯坦福的文斯冲浪和达尔帕的鲍勃汗在1974年的一篇著名论文中描述的，其标题是通信分组网络的协议。TCP呼吁可靠的数据顺序传输，并包括我们今天所说的网络层的大部分内容。在早期，没有拥塞控制的概念。大约15年后，它被添加到互联网上。到1970年代末，TCP和IP被分离，为UDP腾出了空间，也成为了一种不可靠的传输服务。

Originally for packetized voice. At the time, Vince Cerf was an assistant professor here at Stanford. In fact, the paper that they wrote was written at the Cabana Hotel on El Camino in Palo Alto. He moved to DARPA in 1976 to help shed the new Internet project. He's now the chief Internet Evangelist at Google opcom was already at DARPA when the paper was written. Together, they considered the fathers of the modern Internet. 
最初用于打包语音。当时，文斯·塞夫是斯坦福大学的助理教授。事实上，他们写的论文是在帕洛阿尔托的卡米诺小屋酒店写的。他在1976年搬到了DARPA，以帮助摆脱新的互联网项目。他现在是谷歌opcom的首席互联网传道者，当这篇论文撰写时，他已经在DARPA了。他们一起被认为是现代互联网的鼻祖。

In 1983 TCP and IP was first deployed across the internet in a flag day, which means when everyone upgraded the news, use the new protocols at the same time. By 1986, nsfnet was created by the us National Science Foundation to interconnect supercomputers at universities across the us using links running at a blazing speed of 56 kb per second. Other small networks started to pop up all over the place, connecting to the Internet. By the end of the 1980s, there were about 100000 connected hosts. 
1983年，TCP和IP在美国国旗日首次在互联网上部署，这意味着当每个人升级新闻时，同时使用新协议。到1986年，美国国家科学基金会创建了nsfnet，用于连接美国各大学的超级计算机，使用以每秒56 kb的速度运行的链接。其他小型网络开始在各地出现，连接到互联网。到1980年代末，大约有10万台连接主机。

And then around 1990, Tim Berners Ale at CERN invented the World Wide Web, with the first browsers appearing in 1993, most notably the Mosaic browser written by Mark andreesen. I can still remember the day I first saw a web browser in 1993 when I was a graduate student. We knew immediately it would change everything, but we didn't realize how huge that change would be. For many people, this is the dawning of the internet, although, of course, we all know it goes back much further than that, than the World Wide Web. But within a year, over a million people around the world were using the web. And before the end of the 1990s, yahoo, Google, Amazon, eBay were all household names. 
然后大约在1990年，蒂姆·伯纳斯·勒在CERN发明了万维网，第一批浏览器出现在1993年，最著名的是马克·安德烈森编写的马赛克浏览器。我还记得1993年我第一次看到网页浏览器的那一天，当时我还是一名研究生。我们立刻就知道它会改变一切，但我们没有意识到这种改变会有多么巨大。对许多人来说，这是互联网的黎明，当然，我们都知道它要追溯到更远的地方，比万维网还要远。但在一年之内，全世界有超过一百万人使用网络。而在1990年代末之前，雅虎、谷歌、亚马逊、eBay都是家喻户晓的名字。
