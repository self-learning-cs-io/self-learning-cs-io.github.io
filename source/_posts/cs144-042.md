In this unit, you learned a lot about packet switching. This was an intense unit. We started out with a look at why modern networks, including the Internet, are built on a foundation of packet switching. Packet switching is simple in the sense that each packet is a self-sustained unit of data that carries the information necessary for it to reach its its destination. Packet switching is efficient in the sense that it keeps a link busy whenever there's work to be done, rather than a dedicated capacity, reserved reach, user or application. Packet switching can potentially help the network recover quickly from failures. The simple forwarding paradigm with no per flow state in each router makes it easier to quickly route around link and router failures. 
在本单元中，你学到了很多关于分组交换的知识。这是一个紧张的单位。我们首先来看看为什么现代网络，包括互联网，都建立在分组交换的基础上。分组交换的感知很简单，因为每个分组都是一个自我维持的数据单元，承载着到达目的地所需的信息。分组交换的效率感知是，每当有工作需要完成时，它会使链路保持忙碌状态，而不是专用容量、预留范围、用户或应用程序。分组交换可以潜在地帮助网络快速从故障中恢复。每个路由器中没有每流状态的简单转发范例，使得在链路和路由器故障之间快速路由变得更容易。

Next, we dived deep, deep, deep into some of the consequences of packet switching. This took us on a journey that included more math than you'll see in any other unit of this course. 
接下来，我们深入、深入地研究了分组交换的一些后果。这让我们踏上了一次旅程，其中包括的数学内容比您在本课程的任何其他单元中看到的都要多。

Packet switching dynamics determine many of the timing and performing characteristics of the internet, and so you really, really need to have a strong understanding of the packet dynamics. The main mathematical ideas are not that complicated, and it's worth mastering them now. So you can build a strong intuition. 
分组交换动态决定了互联网的许多时序和执行特征，因此您真的需要对分组动态有深入的了解。主要的数学思想并不那么复杂，现在就值得掌握它们。这样你就可以建立强烈的直觉。

You now know why two packets traveling between the same two end hosts might encounter a different delay while the time they spend traversing each link is the same, the packets might take different paths and experience different queueing delays in the routers along the way. It's absolutely crucial that you fully understand the main three components of packet delay, packetization delay, the propagation delay, and the queueing delay, and that you understand the physical processes that cause them You should get into the habit of sketching and using the simple deterministic Q model that I taught you. It's a simple geometric construct, and it letsatsi what's going on. It tells us why routers have buffers and gets us thinking about how big they should be. It tells us why streaming applications need a playback buffer to give a smooth listening or viewing experience for the user. We'll use the same method later when we study congestion control as well. 
您现在知道为什么在相同的两个终端主机之间传输的两个数据包可能会遇到不同的延迟，而它们穿越每个链路的时间是相同的，这些数据包可能会采用不同的路径，并在沿途的路由器中经历不同的排队延迟。你必须完全理解数据包延迟的三个主要组成部分: 数据包化延迟、传播延迟和排队延迟，并且你必须理解导致它们的物理过程，你应该养成草绘和使用我教你的简单确定性Q模型的习惯。这是一个简单的几何结构，它让我们知道发生了什么。它告诉我们为什么路由器有缓冲区，并让我们思考它们应该有多大。它告诉我们为什么流媒体应用程序需要播放缓冲区来为用户提供流畅的收听或观看体验。当我们研究拥塞控制时，我们将使用相同的方法。

Finally, we used the simple deterministic model to learn how a network can go beyond just simple first come, first serve packet delivery. Packet switching network can guarantee the rated that each flow receives and even bound the delay a packet experiences from one end of the network to the other. These required some careful thinking about. Don't worry if it took a long time to get the hang of it. As they were, as there's some difficult concepts at the first, but they're important if you can understand how a packet switch network can provide both rate and delay guarantees, then you have a strong understanding of how packet switching works. 
最后，我们使用简单的确定性模型来学习网络如何超越简单的先到先得的数据包传输。分组交换网络可以保证每个流接收的额定延迟，甚至限制数据包从网络的一端到另一端的延迟。这些需要一些仔细的思考。如果花了很长时间才掌握窍门，不要担心。就像它们一样，一开始有一些困难的概念，但如果你能理解分组交换网络如何提供速率和延迟保证，那么你就对分组交换的工作原理有了深刻的理解，它们很重要。

You learned a lot in this unit. First queueing delay and end to end delay. 
你在这个单元学到了很多东西。第一次排队延迟和端到端延迟。

You learn that the time it takes for a packet to travel between two end hosts is a turn by three components. First, we have to transmit the packet over each link in turn. The time it takes to write the packet on Th, each link is determined by the time it takes to write each bit, multiplied by the number of bits in the packet. We call this the packetization delay. Second, the bits have to propagate down the cable or through the air to the other end of the link. The propagation delay is determined by the speed of propagation, which is close to the speed of light and the distance the bits travel. Make sure the difference between propagation delay and packetization delay is clear in your mind because it's a frequent cause for confusion. 
你了解到数据包在两个终端主机之间传输所需的时间需要三个组件的转换。首先，我们必须轮流在每个链接上传输数据包。在该链接上写入数据包所需的时间，由写入每个位所需的时间乘以数据包中的位数确定。我们称之为数据包化延迟。其次，比特必须通过电缆或空气传播到链路的另一端。传播延迟由接近光速的传播速度和比特传输的距离决定。请确保传播延迟和数据包化延迟之间的区别在您的脑海中是清晰的，因为它经常导致混淆。

Third, the end to end delay has a variable component of queueing delay. Because the internet uses packet switching, the routers have to have buffers to hold packets during time of congestion, and so the queueing delay depends on how busy the network is right now. 
第三，端到端的延迟具有排队延迟的可变分量。因为互联网使用分组交换，路由器必须有缓冲区在拥塞期间保存数据包，因此排队延迟取决于当前网络的繁忙程度。

发言人   03:51
Later, when we study wireless, you'll see the wireless links add more variability to the delay because wireless links are noisy. So packets frequently need to be re transmitted and they can actually have variable changing packetization delays. 
稍后，当我们研究无线时，您会看到无线链路为延迟增加了更多的可变性，因为无线链路有噪音。因此数据包需要频繁重新传输，并且它们实际上可能具有可变的数据包化延迟。

Real time streaming applications such as Skype, YouTube and Netflix need to deliver continuous real time voice and video to our ears and eyes. Even though the network delivers packets at unpredictable times, all streaming applications use a playback buffer to smooth out the variations in packet delay so they can play the video and audio to the user without having to pause and wait for new data. In the middle, you learned how to design a playback buffer, and you learned why it is not possible for the Internet to completely avoid pauses in the playback. Packets can experience a large delay, causing the playback effort buffer to run dry If you fully understand how playback is designed, then you have a good understanding of packet dynamics on the internet. 
Skype、YouTube和Netflix等实时流媒体应用需要向我们的耳朵和眼睛提供连续实时的语音和视频。即使网络在不可预测的时间发送数据包，所有流应用程序也使用播放缓冲区来平滑数据包延迟的变化，以便它们可以向用户播放视频和音频，而无需暂停和等待新数据。在中间，您学习了如何设计播放缓冲区，并了解了为什么互联网无法完全避免播放中的暂停。数据包可能会经历较大的延迟，导致回放工作缓冲区干涸，如果您完全了解回放的设计方式，那么您将对互联网上的数据包动态有很好的理解。

Queueing delay in routers is a complex topic all on its own. The view of queueing theories very mathematically rich, and you can take classes and read many books just on this topic. 
路由器中的排队延迟本身就是一个复杂的话题。排队论的观点在数学上非常丰富，你可以上课并阅读许多关于这个主题的书籍。

In general, queues with complicated random arrival processes are complex beasts. A network consisting of a series of router queues with many computing flows from random users and different applications is way is way hard to understand and analyze in closed form. But our goal here is much less ambitious. We want you to develop some intuition about how cues evolve and how to become familiar with their dynamics. Just like the CT airport security, a router queue holds the packets that have arrived but not yet departed. If we can keep track of arrivals and departures, then we can know how deep the queue is and how long an arriving packet must wait. 
一般来说，具有复杂随机到达过程的队列是复杂的野兽。由一系列路由器队列和来自随机用户和不同应用程序的许多计算流组成的网络很难理解和分析封闭形式。但我们在这里的目标远没有那么雄心勃勃。我们希望您能够发展一些直觉，了解线索如何演变以及如何熟悉它们的动态。就像CT机场安检一样，路由器队列保存已经到达但尚未离开的数据包。如果我们能够跟踪到达和离开的时间，那么我们就可以知道队列的深度以及到达的数据包必须等待的时间。

The deterministic Q model is a geometric representation of packs in the cue, letting us visualize how the Q evolves over time. It's good practice to use this geometric model to help you build your intuition of how the math works. The deterministic Q model helps us understand rate guarantees. 
确定性Q模型是在提示中包的几何表示，让我们可以可视化Q如何随时间演变。使用这个几何模型来帮助您建立数学运作的直觉是一个很好的做法。确定性Q模型有助于我们理解费率保证。

Sometimes we want a particular flow of packages to receive a particular fraction of the network capacity. For example, Stanford Medical, a contract with At and T guaranteeing that its traffic will always receive at least 10 Gb per second of service over the link that attaches this to At and T that's easy to do is simply connect it with a 10 Gib gigabit per second link At and T could also make this guarantee by putting all the Stanford packets into a queue in their routers, making sure they have 10 Gb per second of service. This can be done in very aggregated traffic, like all of Stanford's packets or can be done in individual applications. We might ask Comcast to provide at least 1 mbps to stream our Netflix videos. 
有时我们希望特定的包流接收网络容量的特定部分。例如，斯坦福医疗，一份合同，其中At和T保证其流量将始终通过将其附加到at和T上的链接接收每秒至少10 gb的服务，这很容易做到的是简单地连接它使用每个第二个环节10吉比特的速度，T也可以通过将所有斯坦福数据包放入其路由器的队列中来确保每秒拥有10 Gb的服务来做出保证。这可以以非常聚合的流量完成，就像斯坦福的所有数据包一样，也可以在单个应用程序中完成。我们可能会要求Comcast提供至少1 mbps的速度来流式传输我们的Netflix视频。

You learned how to serve every Q&A router at a minimum rate. If all packets were the same length, it would be trivial, but different packets have different lengths, and so we need to take into consideration how long each packet is. This is where weighted for queueing comes in. It tells us the correct order to serve packets in the router queues so as to take into consideration the length of individual packets. This same idea can be extended to provide delay guarantees. 
你学会了如何以最低速率为每个问答路由器提供服务。如果所有的数据包都是相同的长度，那就微不足道了，但不同的数据包有不同的长度，因此我们需要考虑每个数据包的长度。这就是加权排队的作用。它告诉我们在路由器队列中服务数据包的正确顺序，以便考虑单个数据包的长度。这个想法可以扩展到提供延迟保证。

Now we know how to control the rate at which a queue is served. We can control the maximum delay a packet can experience in the queue. It is simply the length of the queue divided by the rate. All we need to do is limit the length of the queue so we can bound the delay. 
现在我们知道了如何控制队列的服务速率。我们可以控制数据包在队列中可以经历的最大延迟。它只是队列长度除以速率。我们需要做的就是限制队列的长度，这样我们就可以限制延迟。

Finally, you learned how packets are switched and forwarded. As you saw, ethernet switches and internet routers work in very similar ways. When a packet arrives, it looks at the destination address in its forwarding table. If it finds the address, it the packet to its destination, holding it in a buffer if the outgoing link is currently busy Ethernet routers. So Ethernet switches and internet routers differ in which it address they use and how they organize the forwarding tables. And of course, an internet router needs to decrement the TTL field to prevent loops. But at a high level, packet switches all operate in roughly the same way. 
最后，您学习了数据包如何交换和转发。正如你所看到的，以太网交换机和互联网路由器的工作方式非常相似。当数据包到达时，它会在转发表中查看目的地址。如果找到地址，则将数据包发送到目的地，如果传出链接当前繁忙的以太网路由器，则将其保存在缓冲区中。因此，以太网交换机和互联网路由器使用的地址以及组织转发表的方式不同。当然，互联网路由器需要减少TTL字段以防止循环。但在高层次上，分组交换机的操作方式大致相同。

The things you learned in this unit will help you in several ways. One, you can take the description of a network, the rates and length of the length, and the pack length of a packet, and you can figure out the fixed component of the packets end to end delay. You can visualize the variable queueing delay by sketching the queue, which is the most common cause for variable end. When delay in a network, you can explain how a packet switch works, such as an Ethernet switch or an Internet router. You can design a playback buffer for a real time application, and you can explain how a flow traversing a packet switch network can be delivered at minimum rate. And you can explain how individual packets could have a bounded delay from end to end. 
你在本单元学到的东西将在几个方面帮助你。首先，您可以获取网络的描述、数据包的速率和长度以及数据包的包长度，然后您可以计算出数据包端到端延迟的固定分量。您可以通过勾画队列来可视化可变队列延迟，这是可变结束的最常见原因。当网络中有延迟时，您可以解释分组交换机 (如以太网交换机或互联网路由器) 的工作原理。您可以为实时应用程序设计回放缓冲区，并解释如何以最低速率传送流经分组交换网络的流。你可以解释单个数据包如何从头到尾具有有限的延迟。
